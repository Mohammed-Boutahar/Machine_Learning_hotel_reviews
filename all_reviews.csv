This hotel unfortunately didn’t do justice to the 4 stars it holds. The only positive aspect was the location. The room was way too small and the bed felt small for two people. Also the bathroom is super old with an old bathtub. Also there’s no tea/coffee or even minibar in the room. Super unhappy.;2
One of my best trips ! I’m so sad to be back.. I visited THE monument I wanted to visit, The Brooklyn Bridge! Pass by this bridge which offers us an unforgettable view and memories. Without forgetting the unforgettable Times Square, with its lights and the incredible crowd there was. It was amazing! I really liked, i didn't get tired of it How to pass a trip to New York without going through Central Park? Its acres of grass, the ideal place for family picnics in a peaceful setting.  Who says New York says food! We started with Mac and cheese at Beecher's, an artisan cheese maker who also offers... its little pots of mac and cheese, ready to eat to go! We also discovered the Lobster Roll, it's a lobster-based sandwich served in a hot dog bun, Ed's Lobster Bar in Soho for the best;5
Short trip to NYC with my son and we stayed in the New Yorker. It’s a bit tired but the process of updating rooms has started so it will be better in time. This said, we had everything we needed.  The location was central. Within walking distance of all we wanted. Our room had 2 queen size beds. We looked down towards the Hudson River. Our bathroom had the best shower ever. Plenty of towels, travel size toiletries and a hairdryer. Coffee and creamer was provided as well. Staff were always pleasant. It’s a great place to stay.;5
I had stayed here many years ago and the property was definitely looking and feeling a bit tired.  However this was not the case on my recent stay when everything was updated, staff was personable and professional, location is still great.  Would highly recommend.;5
Love this hotel and its central location close to all attractions of the Big Apple. Accros the street from Madison Square Garden, one block away from Penn Train Station. I highly recommend it to everyone visiting NYC for business or pleasure.;5
Decent hotel, good location (though 8th Ave is a hub for homeless people constantly asking you for money). The room was pretty small and basic but it’s all we really needed given it was just a place to sleep at night. The only downside was that the duvet was insanely thin and the TV was quite blurry.   Check in was quick, they took my debit card and immediately took $300 ($100 for the facility fee which they keep and $200 for the security deposit which I’m waiting to get back) which was a bit jarring but it is what it is - what i felt wasn’t fair is that despite paying this facility fee it costed $30 PER DAY to use the coffee machine in the room which was just a basic machine with some plain coffee pods. It was also another $30 I think per day to have a mini fridge in your room,;3
Disappointed. Luckily we stayed only for one night on our way to Washington DC by train. The location was good near Penn Station though. But like often near stations you can expect smell of weed everywhere.  Very crowded and fuzzy in the lobby since there was some kind of youth happening nearby. The room was outdated to say the least, and very small. You could almost hit the toilet seat closing the door. The bed was not very comfortable. The window was small and the view was the opposite brick wall. Sorry, but cannot recommend this hotel.;2
I enjoyed my stay at The New Yorker. Very conveniently located near the train station and has subway access just outside. I also enjoyed looking through the mini museum they have on the basement level. There is a lot of rich history at this hotel and I hope they continue to preserve it in their renovations.  Yes, the rooms are small, but that is to be expected staying in the heart of NYC.  My room had a Keurig and a mini fridge.  I saw some reviews saying they didn’t have that. The room was kind of perpetually damp. I think that has more to do with the weather while we staying. The paint around the bathroom windows was peeling due to the lack of ventilation in the bathroom. I suggest cracking the window open while bathing to help prevent this. (Yes, you can open the windows a;4
Would have given 5 circles but there we a ton of people in the evening but not many elevators on line. We booked through booking.com and got a great rate, then a week before arrival got an offer for  a high floor with a view for an extra $34 a night. SO WORTH IT!  We lucked out with a view that included the Chrysler and Empire state buildings. Near times Square, trains, Madison Square garden, on several bus routes and near subway.;4
When you walk into The New Yorker expect a 10-15 min wait to check in, not including the people who have been waiting even longer. No apologies offered just them in the back chatting. (March 5th 9:30 PM)  When you arrive at the elevator if you’re  on floor 20-40 expect there to be only 2 that actually work and are over crowded so you may end up waiting an additional 15 min to even get to your room. (March 5-9th ongoing)  When you arrive at your room at the 33rd floor have the expectations that your room will smell like kitty litter and cat pee… they chalk it up to “the hotels haunted” yet those smells are USUALLY associated with meth soo. You be the judge. (Room 3329 march 5-9 ongoing)  EXPECT to be harassed by staff…. They had some high school convention going on and they;1
Great location easy walk to broadway, Empire State  building, Macey’s Flat iron district, Little Italy  Time Square, Madam Tussauds and also recommend the big bus open top bus hop on hop off. Hotel rooms are  clean comfortable with very helpful staff on reception .;5
What a disappointment, staff waking me up when signs on door, broken glass in hallway when getting ice, which I stepped on, and no help from staff, the place stinks of cannabis, and when I complained they couldn't give a bollox, I'm allergic to cannabis, what a horrible place,;1
It was my first time staying in New York City. This hotel was in the perfect location for visiting the city and had an amazing time. Good location to enjoy some hockey just across the street from MSG. Great location to walk to attractions like Empire State Building and The Edge Observatory. The staff was awesome and the food was great. Will definitely be staying there anytime I come back to visit more.;5
I enjoyed staying in a clean, newly appointed room in this centrally located art deco hotel.  Subway very nearby as well as major attractions, decent exercise room,  3 good restaurants attached to the lobby depending on the types of meals you are looking for.;4
Hôtel is iconic, art deco style, characterful. Great mid town central location.  Close to Penn Station and Subway.  Beds were a little smaller than what you expect in the States but it was fine. We had an amazing view from our room. Can’t fault the stay.  Would definitely return if back in NYC again. Thanks to Jason the Concierge,  who was very helpful.;5
The New Yorker is one great hotel. Everything about it is right e.g. location - midtown and near so many places such as Macy's, Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station, Times Square and is less than a block from subway stops. The New Yorker is affordable with a variety of good size rooms and suites for most budgets - the room prices are very competitive and the value for the money is excellent. It is a part of the Wyndham group and you can use points plus cash, all points or at the very least collect points during your stay. Full disclosure I have a Wyndham card and pretty much stay at their branded hotels. We found the accommodations super clean, well appointed with a comfortable bed, quality linens, towels and toiletries. The powerful shower had a safety bar which as a senior is;5
Stayed here 4 nights but booked only really for sleeping in. Our room was pretty small & basic but had everything we needed. No tea/coffee facilities in room but you can get for an additional fee. Lobby very grand & good security as they ask to see your key before you get to the lifts so felt safe. Great view of the Empire State Building from our room. Room cleaned every day & fresh towels left. Great location as only 10/15 minute walk to Empire State Building/Times Square & right next to Penn Subway line. Couple of restaurants attached & plenty cafes/fast food places close by. Madison Square Gardens just across the road. Friendly staff & would stay again.;4
I have been to NYC 13 times since 2017.  Samira, Ramona treat me like family and they are the sole reason I always stay here.  In this day and age where customer service is at an all time low, the staff here are fantastic.;5
Che I in was a little slow as it was s busy, but to be fair we had arrived 2 hours early. Staff were patient and polite despite being beer pressure to check a many in. The lobby was very impressive and staff helpful friendly and polite throughout the hotel. Our room was clean and always made up beautifully every morning. It’s location was superb for everything we wanted to visit, especially for our fist night concert at Maddison Square Gardens.;5
I was in NYC with my wife (late 40s) for a second city break, for 4 days.  Good: The hotel is old and outdated and needs a full refit. Some will see that as bad, but I love the old Art Deco styling (see photos) Staff were very helpful Lifts were good. Like 5-6 for floors 1-20 and other side for 21-40. Only had a longish wait once. On-site restaurant food is good, as is the ticktock diner, albeit expensive. Location is excellent, certainly from transport perspective. Penn station is round corner which is a main hub. You can get easily to JFK via airtrain, LIRR, subway Beds are amazing, so comfortable, we both  had great sleeps  Bad: Rooms very small. We 'upgraded' to a room with a view. Not sure about that! Not a fault with hotel per se, but the area stinks of weed. Like every;4
The surrounding area is very daunting and intimidating. The hotel was very outdated. They do not have the normal facilities experienced in a 4* hotel, such as tea and coffee making facilities in your room and they have hidden charges to be aware of? Ask before you book?;2
I do not even consider staying elsewhere in NYC. Clean place and very efficient staff. I have been staying here for every trip to NYC and am very satisfied, prices are reasonable. I highly recommend this hotel.;5
Best hotel i have stayed in aol of my six trips to NYC. Amazing restaurants and great services, people there are great! Hope to stay there again soon enough, hope in 2023 yet. cost effective for sure!;5
I left my sunglasses in my room and there where missing.  I notifided with the security person and after that I talked with the Manager (I don't know her name) and never give me a solution. She told me the hotel had to notify to the insurance company as a claim and wait until have an answer.  I completed and sign a claim or notify form you asked to, and didn't have any answer¡¡¡;1
Room is not good, furniture is old, room windows are not clean which totally deceives the view. Internet speed is very bad. Except that it is in the center of the manhattan there's nothing this hotel can offer.;1
We stayed as a family of 3 (2 adults and a 7 year old) in room 3201 on the 32nd Floor with a view towards the Hudson. I was expecting a small room but it was huge. Could have easily fit in 3 queen size beds and still have room to move around. The room was clean although a little outdated  No fridge or kettle was a little disappointing. The bathroom was also quite small and it took a while for the shower to get hot, but it did have great water pressure.  The gym was decent enough with a good selection of cardio and fixed weights machines. Plenty of sanitisers and a cold water filter. It could have done with Air Con though as was quite warm.   We arrived at 2pm and were checked in straight away with no queues. The reception staff were lovely. The hotel felt safe with room cards;4
Visited with family for 16th birthday celebrations, having emailed the hotel to inform we were treated to a suite on the 40th floor, amazing views. Great location, very good value for money. The coffee at tick tock was the best we had in New York. Very clean and friendly.;4
Ideal location on 8th Ave. clean and efficient rooms and excellent service. Would recommend for family groups in NYC for sightseeing. Right next to Moynihan Train Hall Penn Station for subway and LIRR to JFK airport;4
I have booked this hotel for a trip this November 17-21 st 2023 and they have taken a full prepayment of 1,000 dollars when I selected to pay on arrival. I have messaged, called, AND emailed them and they have not responded once.  I feel this is my only option now to post this review.  Terrible customer service.;1
Multiple issues throughout stay and staff always unwilling and/or unable to help. Have contacted the hotel multiple times to discuss but they don't even bother getting back to you. Staff were unfriendly, even mean. Bathroom not cleaned properly. Very noisy. Tick tock room service unavailable. Staff constantly too busy to assist during stay (if you call the front desk they just hang up on you).;1
Stay away hotel is filthy and extremely dangerous just ask the police officer on the corner who advised me to get a refund before I even checked in. They would not refund my money got to the room it was the size of the closet and filthy hadn't been updated in 50 years. On my way to the room I had three people offered to sell me drugs;1
We had the loveliest stay in this hotel. Mainly thanks to the amazing staff that work here. You can really tell the staff love their jobs and love to help people. Mohammad on reception was absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately on our first night we were in a room with a noisy group of youngsters next to us who kept us up all night and we could hear everything (including the toilet flushing, them talking, their alarm etc.) so we went to reception and asked to be moved and met the wonderful Mohammad who couldn't do enough for us. He let us view multiple rooms to ensure we were happy with our final choice and ultimately ended up upgrading us which was such a wonderful gesture. It really enhanced our stay and we felt he was really understanding of the frustration of being woken up all;5
"Pro's;  -Good location.  -Bath with hot water (although bath needed some attention!)   Cons; - Very tired- the room and hotel really needs some money spent to improve. It was cramped,paint was peeling off the walls and bath, sheet was stained, headboard was peeling,cracked main lampshade and the catpet is just horrific. Bath plug looked like it was from when the building was first built and the actual bath fixture let the water drain out. The chest of drawers had a handle snapped off and the top drawer would keep opening.  - Not very helpful on front desk (they couldn't care less!) Checked in and was given the wrong room number.. then had to lug all my bags down from the 27th floor back to the reception to sort.  - Facilities fees- charged an extra $22 per night plus 2xtaxes for";2
a classic.  warm and fuzzy, new-york style.  tick tock diner is wonderful also <3  great rates, perfect location for any garment center professional, among others :)  love the authentic touches that remain.;5
Fantastic hotel room. Being New York, I was expecting a small cramped room, this was not the case, our room was large with an area with a tea and coffee machine. The bathroom was small but adequate with bath robes. Our room was on the 7th floor and was quite, no street noise, although our room was not at the front. Staff were lovely, check in was friendly, Linda H  on check in was very welcoming and upgraded us. Concierge staff very helpful in assisting us to navigate the train system, giving us a map and advising us on the best way to get to where we wanted to go. On checkout the doorman arranged a taxi to the airport for us while we sat in the comfort of the hotel.  Beautiful comfortable foyer where I met a friend for coffee on the comfortable sofas.  Great location easily;5
Beds are very small. Upon arrival, the doormen were extremely friendly. However, reception staff were a little cold. Paid for hotel well in advance and were left with a bill of over $100 dollars on the morning of us leaving. For “services and fees”. Not satisfied with the behavior of certain staff.;3
Hotel is in a perfect location across from MSG and a few blocks from Times Square and the Empire State. Easily accessible to the subway, 2 minutes away. Great range of bars and restaurants nearby within the area of the hotel and Times Square is good walk away to access the bars and restaurants there. Could do with tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms but that would be my only negative from the trip.;4
I've stayed at the New Yorker twice in a year, first with a travel group and this month with my daughter and 14 year old granddaughter.  The price was reasonable, the location is great, within walking distance to Times Square, Broadway, shopping, restaurants, without as much of the hustle and bustle.  Being close to Penn Station is really a plus also. The subway is just so New York.  It's a good idea to study the lines and areas before you go because it can really be confusing.;5
Great hotel in historical building. Needed somewhere close to Penn Station and this was awesome! Friendly staff and I felt super at ease as a solo traveler. Lots of eating opportunities nearby. Will definitely stay again!!;5
The rooms and beds on floor 7 are brilliant, every night was a guaranteed full nights sleep. The staff were also spectacular, especially Mohammed, he is the shining light of the hotel and always went out of his way to help us and tend to our every need. The hotel is an ideal base for any sightseeing tourists, being that it is on the same road as the Empire State Building and right next to Penn Station. The hotel is also connected to the Tick Tock diner, in which we were served delicious breakfast every day. The New Yorker is truly great!;5
We have just returned from The New Yorker and there are lots of things we liked but on balance the bad knocked the good points down to average. We had our resort fees included in our package with Virgin which was great, however, I do feel the fees are not value for money. We contacted the hotel before we arrived to ask for rooms close together and a nice view. We got one of those requests and had a great view of the Empire State Building. The hotel is clean and staff helpful, it is in an excellent location, so convenient for the attractions and subway.  The not so good now, the smell of weed seems to seep into the rooms through the vent, the rooms are very small and there is no fridge or kettle/coffee maker unless you pay for them. Also, the lifts were a nightmare when we;3
Stayed here over the weekend and while I stayed here over 20 years ago as well the hotel is showing its age. Still decent hotel but will need remodeling soon.  Hotel is very convenient to Penn Station and that’s good if flying from Newark and taking train into the city.;3
Loved this hotel. Excellent location. Went to watch the basketball at Madison Square Gardens which was literally across the road as was Penn Street Station. Ended up taking the train back to the airport because it was so conveniently placed.  We had a twin room and it was a good size although dark because we were directly facing another block but not really an issue. Despite it being minus 15 overnight room was warm and the temperature was easily controllable from a panel in the room.  Easy access to large variety of food places and we particularly enjoyed the Italian in the hotel. Was also across the road from a CVS so easy to stock up on snacks and drinks.  Staff all lovely and helpful and everything lovely and clean with lots of history.;5
We had an amazing stay at The New Yorker and would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in NYC. Mohammed on reception went out of his way to make this an extra special trip by helping us upgrade following our engagement. A trip we will never forget!;5
The New Yorker is in a good position for visiting the sites and shopping. Being on the corner of 8th Avenue and 34th it was easy to get our bearings each day. The lobby is beautiful. I didn’t use any facilities except the room so cannot comment. The room was warm and very clean. I would stay here again even though you can hear street noise. I think wherever you stay in Manhattan you will have street noise.;5
Just back from a great 5 night stay in The New Yorker Hotel. It's in a great location - within easy walking distance of so many places like MSG, Macys, Empire State Building, Penn Station/Moynihan Train Station, Times Square, Broadway & Port Authority to name but a few. 34th Street has excellent shopping with a whole host of stores but if you want to go further afield the subway is right outside your door. The hotel itself offers that old school art deco New York vibe which we loved. Our room was on the 37th floor with great views over the Hudson and it was fabulous watching the sunrise reflected in the sky scrapers right outside every morning. The room was huge, great for 2 adults and 2 teenagers and, for once, nobody complained about needing more pillows  - they were fluffy;4
Centrally located,beautiful hotel and the most fabulous view from our 27 floor room.The room is nice,spotlessly clean and  beautifully appointed with all the usually amenities in coffee, flat TV screen,ironing board, daily perfect housekeeping services.Miguel was the front desk (receptionist) staff checked us in and couldn't  have been nicer and more helpful. Professionalism and great customer care, thank you Miguel!;5
It was not the first time that we have stayed in this hotel, as it is well located for shopping and sightseeing. On this occasion the room was cold and despite good glazing was somewhat draughty. Even when the air conditioning controls were set at maximum you needed to be wearing thick clothes to be comfortable. Two requests to reception to resolve the heating problem got nowhere.;2
Had a double metro room (3404) with stunning views across west Manhattan.very comfy bed.Hot powerful shower.All the amenities i needed Iron board,safe ,coffee maker.Staff very friendly and not a bad price for central NYC.Location perfect .3 restaurants within hotel lobby.(Tick tick diner for breakfast) I’ve stayed here before and will use again when I return to NYC. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED;5
The only good thing about this Hotel is the location! The room as small and dated they aren’t clean the hotel stinks of week as does the whole of NYC . We was 3 adults sharing a room we had to upgrade to a suite just to be able to move this is where the issues started we read the review before. about the Hotel over charging guest and yes they over charged us by over 200 dollars I now have to get my bank to get my money back the staff really don’t have a clue it’s ruined out Holiday;2
From arriving,  staff on reception and around the hotel were so friendly and helpful.  Asked at check in if we could have a room with a view and receptionist checked and up graded.. had an amazing view. Used Tic Tok diner attached to hotel and food was brilliant,  just what we needed after walking all day, also friendly staff. Would definitely recommend this hotel even after reading mixed reviews.;5
Loved the nostalgia of the hotel. The beautiful lobby, the updated beds, the history museum downstairs, all very nice. Front desk staff always more than accommodating. We had a room with a balcony, which was a real treat. Being able to step out on the 22nd floor and having a pretty cool view of the NYC skyline, was a real treat.;4
The hotel is in a great location - especially if you goto JFK or Newark by train as Penn station is on the corner.   I sadly booked the wrong night and we found out when I turned up. Thankfully Mohammad at reception was able to find a solution for us. He was really professional and empathetic - this is hard to find at the moment as so many hotels are understaffed. We did have to book the accommodation again but he was quick in finding a fair solution. A big thanks to Mohammad.   The room was standard, clean and ok the small size but this is quite normal for New York City. We had a great view over midtown and the diner downstairs was great for breakfast.  We would recommend this hotel and stay at again.;5
I checked into The New Yorker Hotel, and from the moment I walked in I was pleasantly greeted, and checked in. The front desk clerk Lilia is amazing. Lilia asked me about my stay, she recommended places to eat, and even asked me if I had any health concerns. Lilia is very caring and attentive and assured that I would have an excellent stay which I most certainly did. Thank you Lilia!;5
There were so many positive reviews for this hotel that it seemed like a safe bet. Boy was I wrong. Let me start with the positives, and the only reasons I’m not giving one star. The location is convenient. It’s one block from Penn Station and MSG. It’s also relatively close to Time Square- about 15 blocks, so definitely walkable. When you walk into the lobby, it’s very opulent and beautiful. Nice tile floors and pretty chandeliers. There is a door man and the staff greets you when you walk in. This gave me a good feeling about the rooms. The feeling didn’t last long. As I walked to the elevators, I was aggressively stopped by the “elevator guards” demanding to see my key.  While I understand this sort of “check” may be necessary in a big city, the approach was a little severe;2
Everything was great, except for the surprise that you charge $5 a bag to store before check-in. I’ve stayed in many Wyndham hotels, including the New Yorker, & I’ve never had to pay a fee. As a Wyndham Rewards member, I think this service should be included. The location was a 3-minute walk from Penn Station. Many of the theaters were only a 15-20 minute walk.;4
The location of this hotel is excellent and enabled us to easily do everything we wanted with a mid-town base. The room was clean and well serviced and really good for the price. Staff and service were excellent and overall it was really good value. In addition, what a fantastic history - I'd recommend a visit to their little 'museum' in the basement.;5
Very convenient location surrounded by restaurants and transportation. We had a room on the 23rd floor, a little small but still very nice. They offer early check in and late check out for a small additional fee which was super convenient. We’ll be staying here again should we choose to come back to the city.;4
Pros: Check-in was good and fast. Perfect location, everything is nearby just 10 -20min away walking depending where do you want to go. Train station next to the hotel.  Restaurants in hotel and nearby Nice lobby I guess…  Cons: Rooms are really small and all decor of the hotel it’s old fashioned and rusty in some areas.  Bathrooms were clean not the best satisfaction when seeing it, you can notice it has not been renovated in a long time. Walls on room were damaged, dents and scratches. I can understand it’s a historic hotel as what i’ve seen but still I understand that the company managing needs to keep everything up to date.  I was not impressed at all with the hotel.  If I ever return to new york I will definitely look other options.;2
The New Yorker is one of those hotels that we've all heard off- every city has them- and you probably ought to stay at once to tick it off the list.  It's in a fantastic location- right by Penn Station and MSG, 5 mins walk from Macy's Herald Sq and the Empire State, 10 mins (if that) from Times Square. Getting anywhere in Manhattan is easy from here. JFK/ EWR are easy to reach from Penn Station too.   There's 3 restaurants in the hotel- Tick Tock is an iconic NY Diner open long hours with a big menu although the food and service are average at best, Trattoria Bianca is a decent Italian with a nice bar and Butcher & Banker a fantastic upscale steak house in the basement.   Downstairs, you'll find a very good fitness centre, a 24hr business centre and a little archive documenting;3
Hotel was clean, cost effective and friendly staff. Close proximity to Madison Square garden and multiple food options.   Historical significance of hotel is documented on the floor below the lobby. Very interesting and informative.   I would definitely stay again.;5
Great hotel with a very advantageous location in midtown Manhattan plus a block or 1/2 block away from the Amtrak station! Also (if you don’t know) Madison Square Garden is right above Penn Station (again, basically right across the street from the hotel).;5
What a classic piece of American history! The staff and service were 100% beyond any NYC hotel I have ever stayed at, especially the help I received from Lilia at the front desk who did triple duty for me when the bellman and porter were unavailable.   I travel everywhere for business and the service here is on par with every 5-star hotel I have ever stayed at!   When you check in ask for the newly renovated rooms!   Safe travels!;5
Where do we start?  Well seeing as the hotel cancelled the booking 2 hours before landing st JFK without telling you, this is probably setting themselves up for a fall.  Arrive at check in desk and they said no you haven't got a room. Hand the guy paperwork, show him the booking.com reservation and he says oh, we've cancelled it. Don't know why and we now have no rooms.  Pulls a rabbit out of the hat and says I'll find one.  Then charges me £425 more than the booking plus a bond on the room on top. Low floor, small, very cramped room, very dated. Think 1940's art deco.  Service terrible from reception, everyone else fairly good.  We emailed the manager 3 times when there, twice when we got back a week later and nobody has replied as apparently cancelling rooms is the norm at The;1
Very very expensive for one night. There were too many problems from start to finish and not enough help to resolve it, or they did not seem to care. The quality of their service was poor, especially for the amount of money that I paid to sleep for one night in New York. I was very disappointed. I'm not sure why people in the customer service industry think it is okay to just be dismissive and disrespectful to other. I paid my money to receive quality services and unfortunately that did not occur.;3
brilliant location, we had to move rooms 1st night due to the noise moved to 28th floor no noise when was great , very small room and hotel is dated although staff are very friendly and helpful, the tick tock rest is great :-)  hotel could def do with makeover   massive down side was not getting deposit back stayed 16-20th December  tried to contact hotel a number of times via email and phone, no replies or even got to speak to someone. they took $633 for these 4 nights.   today I actually got through on the phone and spoke with Ramona Collado and she was great, there was a fault in system and had charged instead or card put on hold, this has now been returned.  Ramona was great and was nice to act talk to some one and for this to be fixed straight away.;3
I love this hotel. It is really convenient to Broadway, Times Square, Madison Square Garden, the Empire State Building, etc. It is somewhat out of the hustle of Times Square but still accessible on foot. Inside it has an older art deco style but with spacious rooms at a decent price. This has been my hotel of choice for the last 10 years, anytime I go to New York for a show or a visit, it is my top choice to stay. The hotel offers 3 restaurants: the Tick Tock Diner is a great choice any time of the day, there is a pretty trendy bar, Trattoria Bianca, which is great for a drink or a bite to eat with there Italian specialties, lastly, there is a beautiful steakhouse below the Hotel, Butcher and Banker, for a finer evening meal. Overall The New Yorker is a fantastic choice for a;5
I stayed 4 nights at this hotel (Monday to Friday) and really enjoyed my stay. The check-in staff was great, there was good security in the lobby with people making sure you had a room key before allowing you into the elevator lobby, the room was nice and clean and my room was made up early in the mornings. I mention this last one as I am an early riser and usually come back for a quick afternoon nap. In a lot of other hotels they only clean the checkout rooms in the morning and when I get back my room is either not done up or I am interrupted in the afternoon. The cleaning staff here was really on top of things.  Another problem I have had at other large older hotels is n NYC is getting an elevator at peak times. There was no issue at the New Yorker. The elevators where not;5
Every aspect of this hotel was perfect for our purposes. I originally made the booking from UK by phone. It was not straightforward as I needed to make 3 separate reservations over a 12 day period. The lady was very accommodating. We were given an upgrade and Driss kindly reserved the same room to provide us with continuity . It is perfectly located for access to train station and Times Square.;5
I like the hotel, its location, the 30ths atmosphere and settings?But at times the age of the building and the infrastructure shows.  We had a spacious corner room (great) but the cold was barely held out by the windows, we had to close the curtains to make the room a bit warmer. The room was huge  ( we are in New York remember) but unfortunately the request for a small extra table was not granted, this would have allowed us to work a bit more comfortable during the two weeks stay with two digital nomads. Lovely staff of course but the place can get fairly busy.;4
Abysmyl from start to finish.  Cancelled booking while in flight to NY from the UK.  Overcharged for room by £400 and given an awful room.  Deliberately ignored 5 emails to reception and the manager and now only email a week after returning.  Will never use this dump again  This is not Las Vegas so why charge a resort fee. New York is not a resort. Most other hotels in NY are better and don't charge one.  The place is tired, poor quality and just not worth the hassle, money or leave you  Save your time and money and get a nice hotel.;1
Good service from staff, excellent area and near all you need,well value for money , clean every day and get what you asked for, security inside the hotel. Less food and beverage that we wanted but there are all around outside;5
Stayed for 5 nights in June 22 from check in to check out the was no issues at all, the staff are friendly & a credit to the hotel. Yes the hotel is a bit dated so if you wanting a shining new style this is not the place for you but if you want a hotel with character & charm this is the place. The room we had did not have a view but that was ok because as we know the size of NYC hotel rooms are on the small size the room we had was massive even having 2 bathrooms & the maids kept it spotless each day for us. I like the way you have to show your room key to get access to the lifts so the place feels safe. The only down thing for me is was the lack of no bar to have a drink in it's not the same sitting in a dinner or restaurant if you fancy a beer at the end of the day;5
Renovated throughout, very comfortable and particularly convenient for rail travelers.  Only drawback is that recovery from pandemic has yet allow the hotel to restore room service meals. But the Tick Tock dinner in the hotel will deliver meals from its menu to rooms.;5
My daughter and I stayed  for four days before Xmas  Staff were super from the lovely lady who looked after our room to the checking in staff could not have been more helpful. We have stayed before but the hotel has really up their game  Fantastic views of empire building room was clean tidy and warm  Hope to be back soon;5
"Lili is a disgusting woman! I  dont know how she still works there. She's very unprofessional and feels very entitled. Unnecessarily aggressive even before I even walked up to her and when I checked her and put her in her place to show her you can't talk to me anyhow, she played the ""Karen"" card. Keep a close eye on her. She's not a good representation of The New Yorker AT ALL!";3
Stayed at the New Yorker Hotel in December right before New Years Eve in NYC. Great experience. Excellent Midtown location. We had two rooms, both were clean and had views of the city. We had a suite with two double beds and a couch- a great fit for the family. The other room was tiny with a great view. The smaller room was great for a couple.;5
"I have stayed here 5 times over the last 4 years and am staying again in Feb so that speaks for itself. I have stayed in many similar rated/prices hotels in nyc before finding the New Yorker and none are up to the same standard. Lots to highlight; the staff have always been so friendly and accommodating to us (at check in, when asking for recommendations, etc). The location is perfect, it’s close enough to everything touristy without being right in your face. There are drug stores, fast food, bars all within stones through for when you want a quick stop.  I’ve seen people say the rooms are dated but that makes them sound run down, they’re old school New York but with all the modern amenities and cleanliness you want. The shower/bathroom has been a little small on some stays but";5
The hotel was very welcoming and check in was quick and easy. Beware of the damage deposit (cash £200 or card £150!). Room nice and clean, bathroom cold but showers amazing. Bed comfy and rooms cleaned daily. Breakfast is amazing in the attached restaurant, we went every morning. I would budget £25 each. Check out is late which meant we could take our time in the morning. Charged to hold bags though which we were not expecting. We have booked again for Dec 24 so I would recommend;5
Check in was really easy. Fenomenal service from mohammed at the front desk. Made sure to answer any questions we had, defintely staying here again!! Stay is also near times square which is an even bigger advantage;5
We stayed here for our first anniversary and requested a room high up with a view. We were on the 36th floor and the views were amazing! I would recommend this hotel if you're looking for something nearby and will be spending most of your time exploring like we did. The room is small but was cleaned every day and towels changed daily too! The staff are very friendly and are always happy to help. The area around the hotel isn't great but there is a lot of police presence around the busy areas so we didn't feel unsafe, just be careful as you would in any other major cities! The McDonalds across the road is a bit dodgy so avoid if you can. But the hotel is so close to the Subway and all the popular cafe's, bagel shops etc. It's close to Times Square which can get very busy! We got;4
stayed over Christmas 4 days room 3408 was really good, hotel is a bit dated but meh i don't bother much about looks. the bed was comfy shower was AMAZING like a new layer of skin each time( TALK ABOUT A POWER SHOWER) lols it was really good.  the view was reasonable we could see the edge observatory from our room which was cool   great location in NYC once we learnt how to use the subways it was so easy to scoot over the town and allways head back to PENN Station as the hotel was right above the station so super easy to get home and head out.  security was making sure the guests are the only ones in the hotel they ask for room keys to be seen which is good, they have no issues with you taking food back to your room again bonus, we got some joe's pizza from times square and it;5
This was our first visit to New York.Which we have had on our bucket list,to celebrate our birthdays for a while now,but Covid has delayed for a few years.   We landed at JFK airport and were pointed to a yellow cab.All very smooth and easy.I would say once you get going hold on.The fare including tip was $80.The driver said his employer prefers card payments,so they are not carrying cash.The card machine gives you the tip options.    Once at the hotel,it was an easy check in,they just asked for a credit card details for a security deposit.Once in the room,it wasn’t as big as I anticipated,but it was ample for us,we were only sleeping there.A double bed,toilet,shower,storage room for cases,T.V.We got up in the morning after a comfortable night.We had our breakfast at the Tick;5
We had a great time, location excellent for Penn Station making it easy to get in from Newark and unbeatable location for Madison Square gardens which is just across the road. Only 10 min walk to Hudson yards for shopping and The Edge viewing platform which was amazing, just a 10 min walk to Macy's too.  We never used the Subway at all as everything was in walking distance.  Only 5 min walk to Port Authority for buses to NJ and was easy to get to Jersey gardens for shopping.  Hotel itself was great, we were allocated one of the Tesla Rooms and although the room was bit of a squeeze for a family with luggage and shopping the views were amazing, Empire State and One Vanderbilt were both visible from the window.  Staff were all very friendly and courteous.  We used the bar a couple;4
I gave my wife this get quick trip as a Christmas present.  We had a quick get away to NYC to take in the sights and see a Broadway show.  The hotel was quiet clean and in a great midtown location.  The front desk clerk, Mohammed, was very helpful and checked in with us to make sure everything was in order.  Outstanding experience!;5
We Stayed there for 5 Nights Loved this hotel When we checked in straight away we got a upgrade to room with a view  The cleaners were in the room every day  Hotel was a great location we also got a late check out we will book into this hotel when we come back to New York;4
We booked one night at the New Yorker for a quick visit to NYC.  Due to a medical emergency, which occurred in the hotel lobby, my family and I spent several nights at this hotel.  The accommodations are quite nice.  Very clean, updated rooms at an affordable price.  What is most amazing about this hotel is the staff;5
Stayed from 13th - 19th December 2022 as a party of 4. Our trip was to celebrate my 40th and my fiancé and I getting Married whilst in New York. I had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to explain as much and request an upgrade if possible. We arrived at 14:00 and the kind reception team confirmed we had been granted an upgrade but the rooms wouldn't be ready until later in the day. We dumped our luggage, $5 per bay and went off to explore. We returned to the hotel at 17:00 to find one of the rooms was ready and the second wouldn't be ready until 22:00 (03:00 UK time). Obviously we was very tired at this point after a full day travelling. We headed out again to return at 20:00 on the off chance the second room would be ready. It wasn't but the amazing reception team offered;5
We made a quick trip to NYC and the New Yorker is very conveniently located adjacent to Penn Station.   We stayed during the frigid arctic air mass that had moved into the area but the hotel was cozy and central to everything,   Even the harsh weather didn't dampen our stay.;5
We stayed 5 nights the week before Christmas. We enjoyed our stay, would stay again. Originally were on a lower floor and it was loud even with our sound machine. So we asked to be moved to a higher room and were surprised they had any open rooms but were moved to a large room on the 38th floor that was perfect! Great location and every staff member we talked to was very friendly and helpful. We ate at Tick Tock diner and it was great! Super busy that time of year but they have a great system and things moved quickly. We like to try different hotels every time we got to NYC but I would definitely stay here again!;4
From the moment you checked in your every need was catered for and the staff went above and beyond to make sure your stay there would be amazing, with fitness suite, restaurants all part of the hotel it was easy to plan your evenings and the location made it easy to plan how you’d spend your days touring the city, close to subway stations and the Empire State Building, Macy’s, Maddison square garden, you were never far from something that shouted New York;5
Last minute reservation done on the Airtrain at JFK. My wife was sick and I didn’t think we could make it all the way home. Chose this hotel because it was across from Penn (Now Moynihan) station. It was a busy time but the wait to check in was short and easy. Room was small but very nice. And the people, both guests and staff were great.;5
"This is a classic Icon of a hotel in the heart of the city.   We have been here many times and it seems to get better and better each time!  The staff is very professional.  The room is roomy for a NY hotel.   The beds are comfortable and the shower is amazing!!!  Lots of pressure!   The views are great and the history museum wall in the basement area is worth looking at...such fun in the ""old days!""   There is an excellent Italian Restaurant off of the lobby and coffee is served in the lobby in the morning with really good croissants!  Everything is walk able and near by...even in the winter months.   We seen the Rockettes at Radio City Hall...a lot of fun!!!  Don't miss Shen Yun at Lincoln Center...coming up!!   We will be back at the The New Yorker soon!!!";5
For a six night stay at this hotel was brilliant including our Flights with Aer Lingus the Holiday cost us £1689, the Room was a little dated but every thing worked, and that was fine for myself and my wife,  plenty of cupboard space for your  clothe, The staff where very helpful and reception staff where great to tall too and give you help when ever you needed it. I have nothing to complain about  was  right next to Penn Station for Trains, Bus, and the subway, will situated in Manhattan would defiantly stay again.;5
I treated my girlfriend for her 40th a trip to New York, wanted to go somewhere iconic to NYC and had been told the New Yorker is the place to go due to the location and history.   The stay was fun and we enjoyed it, what I cannot believe is that the deposit they took wasn't held but actually took the payment and not returned. I have emailed loads of times and tried calling, nothing. The payment of over 260 EUROS has been taken on the 15th November we stayed for 5 nights, promised it would be returned within 10 business days yet no sign of it, right before Christmas too so thanks for that.  A nice trip tarnished by a lack of customer care, I guess once you got the money it doesnt matter right?;2
Arrived 2 hours early if check in, it was me and my 13 year old daughter. Receptionist immediately put us at ease and assured us that we could check in. She didn’t charge us for early check in and she also upgraded our room free of charge. The view on the 32nd floor was amazing, and lying in bed at night you could see New York sky line and it was so pretty. Room was clean and tidy and had everything we needed. It is an old hotel, but this added to the charm and character, which we really liked. Housekeeping staff were on hand every day to clean and freshen up room. Nothing was to much hassle. It was in a central location and had everything you needed around the hotel.;5
Firstly the positives. Beds comfy and pillow’s comfy. Good location for sights. That’s about it.   Room is tiny. Really not big enough for a family of 4. I slept in bed closest to the window and there was a cold draft. Noisy ( I know that I should expect noise from the streets as in central Manhattan) shouldn’t really be subjected to hearing next door flush their toilet or turn their taps on and off.    For a family the room is just not big enough so if there are more than two people in your party don’t consider this.  Homeless people loitering outside   With some investment it could be really lovely but it’s shabby and dated. My daughter said she felt like she was in the Hollywood Tower of Terror.;3
Rooms and common area kept clean.  Everything in good working order.  Rooms are from an early era, so small.  Water temp fluctuates, so be careful, old two faucet system without balance.  All the staff was nice and professional.;5
"On the whole I have to give this a ""very good"".  Rooms are spacious for New York (although we did get an upgrade) the bathroom was tiny though, and very dated.  The heating took a while to master.  We ate breakfast daily in the diner downstairs, which was good.  Reception staff really pleasant and helpful.  Concierge and door staff were typical New Yorkers!";4
Awful hotel old fashioned and would never stay there again i have left a review with the hotel and hope that others see it before booking its not at all deco as advertised its more run down and stuck in stone age;1
So our stay was good. While I get that it is an old hotel. It does need some updating. The bathroom was an icebox the draft from all windows was terrible. We had to have the heat on full. But the staff was friendly and approachable. The cleaning staff do an amazing job, we were happy to leave daily tip. The ice machine on our floor never worked. Also it would have been nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room. The bath faucet spewed out brown water until I let it run. All in all I’d give it 9/10. For convenience to surrounding area.;4
Just back from a four night December stay at the New Yorker for my wife’s 40th birthday and had a great time.   We arrived just after 2pm on a Sunday and they checked us in right away. We were put on the 36th floor with a great view along 34th street towards the edge and Hudson yards. Room was clean and came with a fridge and coffee machine. Room wasn’t tiny as I’ve seen some people mention, plenty of room for our cases to sit alongside the wall or to store at the bottom of the walk in closet. Room also had a hairdryer, ironing board and iron.   Shower was great and the bed was very comfy. Walls are a bit thin so you can hear people moving about especially in the morning but probably to do with the age of the hotel. Nothing that disturbed my sleep at all.   Despite only being;4
Centrally located. Easy access to all subway lines.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  Rooms are smaller, but do the job.  Great landing spot if you're looking for a place to stay when you're in New York.;5
We had a wonderful time at the Row NYC.  Our check-in process was simple. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the place was suitable.   We would love to stay there again. The price is quite reasonable for a nice location.;4
Overall the hotel is clean and staff are nice. Your in the heart of NYC, so don’t expect it to be cheap and don’t expect the rooms to be of a nice size.  The only disappointing part of our stay was that we had to pay $20 to store our bags for a few hours before we left for our flight. Personally I think this should be free and included with your stay price like the majority of other hotels.   Other than that, it was nice and I would consider staying again if the price was right.;4
I stay at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel all the time, every time I am in New York. They have great service, great staff and its at a great location. All the staff members are friendly and help you get what you need within their defined roles capabilities and make sure your needs are met. Its nice and the atmosphere is fancy and family friendly. There's a diner and an Italian restaurant inside so you don't have to leave far for food~;5
"The staff is excellent; however, the rooms are extremely small and in bad need of upgrades!  There is only one floor in the entire hotel that has updated rooms, and even those are in bad need of upgrades.  The rooms are so small that there is absolutely no place to put your baggage; I had a hard time closing the door of the room because my luggage kept hitting the door.  I had 2 rooms; one of the rooms was so small that when you open the door it hits the bed.  We had a great time in New York - after doing all of the walking all day exploring, it would have been nice to come back to a decent hotel room.";2
Hurbert was extremely rude & huge up directly in my face not only that but the hotel has a serious dirt problem ESPECIALLY in the hallways you can see the built up dirt bed sheet feel like im sleeping w paper & gives an overall old vibe;1
Rooms were clean, staff amazing, hotel is fantastically situated within walking distance of all the major sites, the hop on hop off bus is a 5 min walk away. The art deco look of the hotel makes it feel like your walking into something special;4
Horrible experience. From the room to the staff to the elevators to the cleanliness everything is overpriced, overrated, and a basic lie. Staff including managers are rude. Never again. The overall experience traumatized me;1
I’m still reading reviews on TA and I think I had  the wrong hotel.    Guest check in, rude staff at the time of visit.   We had several cases and not offered concierge or porter service.   Harassed  by a staff salesperson trying to sell a condo visit whilst in the lobby for a free meal.  Not impressed  with that tactic.   Rooms Very old, showing signs of disrepair inside and out such as the windows that might’ve well not been there    I had to jam a towel into the void between the windows panes to stop the freezing draught.   The room is dirty with years worth of dust and dead cells behind the bed.  It has not been cleaned properly.  Wallpaper coming away from walls  Poor paint work Blood on the curtains  Carpet that could do with a clean.  Lamp doesn’t work  Air con doesn’t;2
Hotel is in a fantastic location to visit tourist haunts. Across the road from Madison Square Gardens. Staff courteous from reception to cleaners. Beds very comfortable and the shower was powerful. Rooms on small side for 2 double beds, limited room to maneuver between bed and tv. Hotel could do with decoration as rooms and hallways looking tired. Never felt unsafe or u comfortable at night. We ate in 2 of the restaurants and food was delicious.;4
Great location. Found staff to be friendly and helpful. Room was small, very clean but in need of modernisation (50 shades of brown). Tick Tock diner is a great place for breakfast. No queues, quick service, tasky and reasonably priced. Despite the very brown and small room I would use again.;4
Great City Location The New Yorker is in a fantastic place for exploring and getting around the city, situated right opposite Penn Station and Maddison Square Garden and a short walk from Times Square and Hudson mall and piers. Hotel staff were friendly and professional and hotel clean but although it’s an old hotel with lots of history it needs a bit of an upgrade/paint etc looks tired but bed comfortable and being the city that never sleeps it was well received after a long day on our feet. No tea and coffee in rooms but a coffee bar in lobby and the Tick Tock 24 hr diner too, good choice of breakfast and meals and also a McDonald’s and Starbucks right opposite hotel although plenty diners and bagel shops on each corner too.;3
My husband and I arrived at 11:00 PM and had asked for a late check out since we arrived so late. We we informed that it was not possible because there was a very large group arriving the next day. We understood and went to our room to find it completely trashed! Mind you we didn’t arrive until 11 PM! Why was this room untouched? We were given another room but felt uneasy about the cleanliness of the facilities because of what we had just experienced. (Photos posted are of the first room we were given upon opening the door) The new room was cramped and small as was the bathroom and there were stains on the curtains. We have stayed in small facilities before but they were at least renovated and cleaned. We like to check out the hotels in NYC so when people ask for recommendations;2
We stayed 3 nights prior to Thanksgiving and had booked a double room with an optional upgrade to a double/double to allow our daughter (living in NJ) to stay with us for one night. The upgrade wasn't available but Lynn on reception was able to upgrade us to a suite with a view for not too much extra making the overall stay really good value. The hotel was busy throughout our visit but very clean throughout and ideally located for sightseeing and access to  NJ from Penn Station. There was plenty of choice for places to eat within a short walking distance, including the Tik Tok diner located in the Foyer which was reasonably priced and good quality.  Good hotel, I would thoroughly reccomend it.;5
November 2022. Hotel in great location right next to Penn Station with easy access to subway and walkable to many restaurants and Times Square area. Lobby and communal areas are well kept and spacious. However, we booked a single queen room and were really disappointed. The room was clean but both bathroom and bed area were worn and very outdated. Noisy overnight as well with loud  guests in nearby rooms. If you get a cheap price then this is fine but accommodation standards in the room we had was way below expectations for price we paid.;3
From the moment we arrived till the moment we checked out we were treated fantastically , staff couldn’t do enough for you , room was immaculate and a great bathroom and with tons of fluffy towels . This will be our go to hotel whenever visiting New York from now on . Huge thanks to Belkis who went above and beyond for us;5
I believe you just need to look at a hotels towels to tell you everything you need to know.  Their bath towels are tea towel size and mean.  No shower gel just soap - tells you everything.  $389 a night.  Cramped damp, or too hot, ugly, battered and unpleasant.  The bathroom looks like it was last renovated in the 70's and the shower is a basic scalding or freezing mixer.  The bedroom is cheap and dated.  The staff are pleasant.    Just don't.  The holiday inn is down the road and would be much better.;1
"A Wonderful,  Clean, Safe Hotel. From the moment you pull up.to the hotel you are greeted by a wonderful Doorman/ Bellman when you walk into the Spacious Well Lit and Designed Lobby the Front Desk.Staff welcomes you with Open Arms as if you are Family. The rooms are Spotless the hallways are Super Clean.  3 restaurants on premises.  EXTREMELY SAFE with a Profesional  Security  Team not just a.Freak in a Uniform  But well  managed security.  I have traveled all over staying  in regular and super expensive places. The New Yorker is what a Hotel is meant to be "" A Home Away  From Home.  If you stay anywhere else in New York City you are Foolish.";5
Just returned after 4 nights at the New Yorker.  The hotel is right opposite penn station which was fantastic as we got the train from the airport. The hotel is art deco style and has a huge reception . Check in was quick and we arrived in our double room on floor 21.  The room was ok it was slightly outdated decor wise but it was clean and had a bath and a shower. They made the bed each day and changed the towels. The bed was really comfortable and There was a tv and a small wardrobe with a safe in it.  There was no kettle or tea/ coffee facilities which was a shame as all you wanted in the Morning was a coffee. However opposite the hotel is a Starbucks roughly $5 a coffee or a macdonalds about $3 a coffee. There is also 2 supermarkets 1 minute walk next door should you need;4
We stayed at the new yorker for six nights, the girl at reception made sure we had a room with a view , a view of the empire state building no less, the staff were always friendly and helpful,  the room was clean tidy and comfortable, perfect location, subway station just outside,  walking distance to times square, bars and diners close by,  maceys just up the road, yellow cabs always outside if you needed one, if one not there, the doorman hailed one for you, would highly recommended staying here, we would return without hesitation;5
The hotel rooms need to be remodeled. Halls look dingy and the rooms need paint. Complained and was moved to the remodeled tower. 100% better. There is a resort fee and I didn’t see any resort offerings. Paid to much to stay here. Not worth it. On-site restaurant was not good and the little cafe coffee was horrible.;1
Perfect location close to the empire state building,time square,macys,and numerous restaurants and bars. The hotel itself is a little bit tired but my room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff were very polite and helpfull. The restaurant food was excellent along with the breakfast bar.;4
Mohammad at the front desk is a LEGEND! He truly went above and beyond to make sure my kids' first visit to the city was a memorable one.   The location is great for touristy stuff and the hotel / room was very clean.   No complaints at all!;5
Mohamed who works at the front desk is incredible!  He was so friendly and helpful!  We could not have asked for better service. He went above and beyond to accommodate my family!  We appreciate the great customer service he provided!;4
Great customer service from everyone. I would recommend this to anyone from couples to families to business. Very comfortable. I was staying here for business but I will 100% be coming back to stay again.;5
Just returned from a few days at The New Yorker. Great location, the room was adequate with comfortable clean beds and plenty of space for 3 ladies thanks to the upgrade from Mohammed who was very helpful and friendly as was all of the staff that we encountered. Housekeeping provided clean towels every day, the only downside is that there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms but that would not stop me returning to this hotel;5
Great service, super clean (albeit typically smaller) rooms, 24 hour impressive security, great big comfortable lobby, awesome location, and reasonable prices with optional incredible views.  Best value in town!;5
From the Art Deco lobby to the comfortable rooms, onsite diner and location, The Wyndham New Yorker hotel had it all! Very comfortable beds, classic Art Deco fittings, friendly and very helpful staff - no complaints whatsoever.  For the size of the hotel, there was never a long wait for the lift - a bonus when we were desperate to get onto the NYC streets to explore! Hairdryer in the room was perfectly adequate and UK straighteners worked just fine - shampoo, conditioner and body lotion supplied, so pack shower gel! Wouldn't hesitate to return to this hotel.;4
Had a wonderful experience.  Maria @ the front desk couldn't have been more helpful!   Great location with three on-site restaurants.  Really enjoyed the diner (Tik-Tok ).  Was surprised to find out that the restaurant is open 24 hrs and serves drinks to 3 a.m.  Anyways, highly recommended historic hotel.;5
We went to NYC for my birthday and had reservations at The New Yorker. We arrived before noon and the front desk person said our room was ready. I told her it was my birthday and asked for an upgrade. She said we could have an upgrade which I thought was very nice. However, when we got to the room, it was a suite with two baths, living room, dining area , wet bar and balcony. It was one of the best hotel rooms, we have ever stayed in. We have stayed at The New Yorker previously, because it is within walking distance of Penn Station. We enjoyed our stay and will be back.;5
Arrived for a 4 day break at the New Yorker and immediately pleased with the location, walking distance to many tourist landmarks. Maria on the front desk took some extra time to give us tips and local knowledge which was greatly appreciated plus some recommendations of where to go which really paid off. All the staff were lovely but Maria made an extra effort when we saw her, a credit to the hotel. Would definitely stay again. Our room wasn't the biggest but clean, quiet, everything worked and the bed was really comfortable. Ideal for couples on their first visit to the big apple.;5
5 of us girls stayed at the New Yorker in the October half term and enjoyed a fabulous time there. Rooms were clean and comfortable ,staff were very friendly and the bar and Tick Tock diner were welcoming with excellent choice of food in the diner. We had our breakfast there most mornings. The hotel was very central to Times Square and just across the road from Penn Station where we used the subway regularly to get around.Madison Square Gardens was situated next door and the Empire State Building and Macy’s Store were  just a few blocks away .;5
Room, tired,drab very basic Heating and hence air con extremely noisy. Not just a fan blowing rattling and clonking that won’t let you sleep actually sounds like someone breaking into the room. Min amenities  Price of room was supposed to include breakfast and find that breakfast isn’t served on site apparently 5 min walk up the road Don’t bother to stay here,  many more much better hotels to stay in;2
I picked this hotel for my stay in NYC because of the history it holds and the Art Deco design.  The lobby was smaller than I thought it would be, but was impressive all the same.  The staff at check in would friendly and let me got up to my room before the normal check in time.  The rooms are smaller, like in most NYC hotels and were probably used as offices back when it was built.  I had my own thermostat and actually had a pretty nice view out the window.  The water pressure in the bathroom was amazing and there was plenty of hot water.  My only complaints were the carpeting in the rooms and halls were old and a bit nasty and the halls were extremely dim.  They need to do a few renovations to make the whole experience top notch.;4
Great location- close to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, just a short walk to Times Square. The attached Tick Tock Diner served excellent meals.  Friendly staff. Our reception clerk, Mohammed, was especially helpful. He upgraded our room to a suite with two bathrooms, which made our stay even more enjoyable.  We were very pleased with this experience, and this will be our first choice for our next stay in midtown Manhattan.;5
Fabulous location although rooms themselves quite run down. Clean, secure, quiet. Positives outweigh no view from back side room. Tea/Coffee making in room would have been great. Also perhaps washing line in bathroom. There was always staff available and they always acknowledged us.;4
First stay in New York and we loved this hotel. There were 3 of us so we had a room with 2 double beds and a sofa bed. The bedroom was quite big with the bedroom separated from the couch/ sofa bed area. The best part of the room was an outdoor patio with the best view of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens! The weather was beautiful this week so we spent the morning before heading out, and the evening before bed out there - what a view!!  The beds were comfortable and the shower had lots of pressure. The subway was right by the hotel and so many of the locations we wanted to see were within walking distance. We would recommend this hotel for sure!;5
Pleasantly surprised Really pleased with this hotel, from the outside it just looked dauntingly big but once inside an excellent  concern, comfortable rooms although a little on the small side. Lifts were efficient and plentiful and  everything was well run for a huge concern.  Well located.;4
Having read previous reviews which I take seriously, I looked forward to getting to this hotel after nearly a 3 year wait and was celebrating my birthday whilst there and my wife was belatedly celebrating her 60th and the hotel knew this as it was mentioned on the booking, Previous users have extollled the virtues of the check in staff and their willingness to offer free upgrades NO such luck for us We were then allocated a room on the 21st floor which we didn't realise at that time would mean a terrible wait most of the time for elevators. The elevators on the right serve floors 20 to 40 and are so busy. whereas floors up to 20 use elevators on the left which seemed to hardly be used. The rooms were old and dated and did not seem to reflect the glossy look on the website. Also;3
What I loved most about this property was Driss at the front desk aka the painter. He was amazing and made our stay unforgettable. My friends and I couldn’t be more appreciative of everything he did for us 💙 There was lots of space in the lobby for our group to meet everyday. the amenities were good and there were lots of options right in the hotel from a muffin and coffee to high end eating at Butcher and Banker. The location was great as it is out of the noise of Times Square but the subway is steps away and Macy’s is a block away!;5
Great location.   Great security procedures at the entrance and in room. We must show the room key to the security personnel before getting in the elevator. When we returned to the room during the room cleaning was in service, the cleaning personnel asked us to put the key card to open the door in order to proof that we stay in that room.  Bed and restroom cleaning are good.   The hotel should improve the cleanliness in the hallway, corridor, entrance, and the far to reach areas in the room, such as lightning/lamps, bathroom-vent on the ceiling etc. It was very dusty and dull the the hotel very greatly. The dead-bolt at the door was out of order. The room smelled a bit and we sensed overpower use of the air refreshing spray to override the odour in the room.  We were so far;3
i come to new york 3 times a year. first time and last time this hotel. from staff to manager outrageous how they deal with customers. everything must go quickly you must pay quickly the manager comes eve beep and confirmed without hearing your story immediately what the staff says without any knowledge of booking or looking into the system. Arlo hotels and Riu hotel I recommend this to you!;2
Absolute nightmare with this hotel with the communication side. I originally booked this hotel in may 2020, had to cancel due to covid as we where not allowed to fly from the uk. They would not give me a refund and was offered a voucher which i had to accept. spoke to nice lady called Neida who said let me know when you want to rebook. I emailed Neida and let her know that we want to stay December 2022 and gave the dates for when we will arrive. I was given the price as was told that i was pencilled in. Several emails later and several phone calls with no reply as i keep getting fobbed off by the phone saying send a email. I have done this several times with no joy. The customer service is very poor on this occasion. Still do not know whether we will be staying at this hotel as;1
Some may say old and dated-  yes but iconic.    Beautiful  art deco must have been fabulous in its heyday-   rooms ok not luxury but certainly comfortable and clean.   Staff so helpful and a special mention for Mohammed on reception who did more than we expected for us,   Enjoying  our stay !;4
For at least ten years, our family has stayed at the New Yorker hotel when we visit from the Boston area. It is clean, comfortable, and full of fun Art Deco touches. The Tick Tock Diner next door is also excellent. We have recommended it to many many people.;5
Very centrally located.  Clean and quiet. I loved how big this room was compared to other hotels in NYC. Right across from Madison square garden. We will definitely be back. It was a great experience overall.;5
Ideally located hotel, only a few steps away from Madison Square Garden, subway across the road and within a short walk of Times Square, Broadway and Fifth Avenue shopping.  Beautiful front lobby area with coffee, fruit & pastries available to buy in the morning and/or the Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel for pancakes, waffles and/or everything else imaginable. Personally I would have liked tea/coffee making facilities in the room.   We were upgraded to a larger room on arrival which was fantastic as it had two bathrooms and just gave us that bit of extra space- the original room would have felt cramped in comparison. The beds themselves were really comfortable if a bit on the small side for a double. Our room was cleaned everyday with toiletries and towels refreshed daily;4
Excellent value per the price, good facilities/rooms and excellent location. Close to key amenities. Bag service. Restaurant in the same hotel. Highly recommend it. Hotel Manager on top of things and very customer oriented;5
The Art Deco hotel is in a great location but is somewhat tired.  Some of the staff were simply doing a job and struggled to extend the courtesy to guests that one would normally expect. The addition of a hefty resort fee of well over $30 per night was both unexpected and hard to justify given the quality of the hotel.  Rooms are understandably small given the location but they are also a little dirty and could do with a refresh and better daily servicing by the cleaning staff.;3
"The hotel lobby is absolutely underwhelming. A circus show with the feeling of a dilapidated theme park. Arduous check-in process. This place is stuck in a freeze frame of 20 years ago but with wear and tear accelerated. Carpet is threadbare and I'm shocked at how the fabric on the headboards is greasy and worn out. The fact this is a ""4-star"" hotel may be the biggest jokes on the internet. Many hotels in NYC get away with murder, so to speak. There's nothing about this hotel that is 4-star. It's a solid 2-3 star. It is also VERY loud in the hallway. Anyone walking by or talking in the hallway sounds like they are in the same room as you.   They charge to hold your bag where other hotels do this for free. The internet is not good. Excellent location but that's about it.";2
Dusty old room with no kettle, coffee machine or fridge. For the price we paid you would expect these things :( staff were the only highlight. Invoice kept growing from original price i Isidro in booking.com. (Still awaiting answers in this 2 weeks on).;1
Hotel is in a good location, stag is friendly and helpful. We had a suite with a view of the Empire State Building, the rooms are dated and bathrooms as well, but expected with the age of the hotel. The cleanliness and comfort of the bed was decent though. Although they have multiple elevators, during busy times give yourself time as they are full and difficult to get into.;4
The room was fine, the location near the train station so that was a plus. We left though feeling ripped off. We asked them to store our luggage for a couple hours after we checked out. We wanted to walk around a bit before our flight. They charge you $5 per bag, even if the bag is a briefcase and a camera case! They wouldn't let us consolidate our bags. I think they charge enough for the room, storing your luggage for a couple hours should be gratuitous.;2
First all all a big thank you to the new yorker staff who were always there to help and when leaving the concierge man who sorted out our taxi back to jfk sorry but never got his name but he was brilliant. Loved the hotel in a great location and would I go to the new yorker hotel again. The answer is YES .On another note book online with central park attractions and ask for Prince knowledgeable funny and took us to all the locations in the park .what a place to get married at the ladies pavilion. But the New Yorker hotel is thr place for us again;5
Stayed here for 4 nights with friends on a recent trip to New York. We booked the hotel through a package deal with virgin holidays.  I emailed ahead and requested rooms with a view as our party were celebrating a birthday and we were given excellent rooms (3318) with views of the empire state, Chrysler building AND Madison square garden from our window!!!  Jessica on the reception desk was particularly helpful so Thankyou!  The hotel itself is a little tired around the edges, carpets and wall paper could do with an uplift but these are minor niggles. It’s a beautiful art deco hotel with many original features which have been maintained well. The rooms were clean and functional, they have an iron and most have a coffee machine. The beds were so SO comfortable and extremely;5
We had heard about the small rooms, but our first room was too small to even unpack 2 bags. So we ended up upgrading at a price.  They did give us a suite with a great view.  It felt very safe. It's an older building but it was clean.;3
Excellent experience at the New Yorker. Check in was a breeze with Adriana. Our room was ready, so we got settled in without having to store our luggage. Our two double room was spacious and quiet. Love the decor — takes you back in time do old NYC. The location can’t be beat for shopping and public transportation.;5
Cannot beat location if you are arriving at Penn Station- steps away.  The baggage check is quick and easy and inexpensive.  The hotel aesthetic and service is classic, my favorite.  Stay there every time we are in NYC...ask for the Tesla room!;5
The New Yorker is a classic skyscraper in New York City (no surprise with the name and the large exterior signage) with a splendid lobby that is worth viewing if nothing else, but go one floor down via the escalator on the right to check out the Tesla museum and some old photos of the heyday of the hotel;5
Booked on Hotels.com - pay at property.  Used a card to hold the reservation as required and assured that I could use any payment at the hotel.  The day before check-in the original card was charged.  I immediately called and said I want to use a different card for payment, was assured that I could.  When I got to the hotel the friendly front desk person issued a refund and charged the correct card.  I was assured that the refund will take 2-3 days.  Three days later, still no refund.  Called the front desk again today and was told that the refund would not take 7-10 days.  So the hotel has $646.00 for a $323.00 stay.  I will think twice about booking with Hotels.com and using my credit cards at hotels.;2
3 night stay. Hardly in hotel . Beds extremely comfortable. Rooms are dated however the whole hotel is quirky. We had a double double which had 2 bathrooms. No kettle though.  Plenty of staff and wasn’t aware of any issues. We paid our deposit etc by cash as heard there was issues with paying by card.  Good location for Penn station and Madison Sq Gardens;4
First room was tiny and not enough space for the luggage but was moved the next night to a room I would have expected for the hotel name and price. The staff were friendly and we did use both the bars for drinks and food and although pricey we enjoyed it. One man on reception stood out as working above and beyond the call of duty. Great location and close to everything but the rooms on floors 20 and above need a refurb.;4
I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. The room is as you would expect in New York quite small. The bathroom was very old fashioned. The bars attached to the hotel were very good. The hotel is across the road from Madison Square Garden and 10mins from Times Square. The walk to Times Square there is a lot of homeless and people on substances but if you ignore them they will ignore you.;3
Great staff, quiet, and clean!!  Everyone was so nice!  Highly recommend! Check in was a breeze and our room was great with 2 bathrooms.  I will definitely be staying there again and have recommended to all my friends and family.  Great historic hotel and great experience!;5
the hotel has the best location in the city  , and the service is  on point and the experience is worthy , the hotel is always busy so better to book  in advance,  I would recommend to   ask for early check in if planning;5
The reason for the poor review only has to be due to what I can only describe as a dangerous event. On our first evening at 0130hrs we were spoken to a strong smell of cannabis so much we were sick. The corridor outside our room was dense smoke like there was a fire! I went to reception who did not seem phased and move us to another floor! No attempt was made to locate the offender all be it there was no doubt it was coming from the room next to ours! The rest of the stay 6 days was uneventful until we checked out! We made sure there was not any transaction on our credit card which you are required to leave at booking in, we were told there was not however when return to the Uk we discovered £1078 had been taken from both parties credit cards! Reported to card company who;2
This is an older hotel - art deco.  Has been renovated but still feels old.  Location is the best part - close to subway - close to Times Square and Hudson Yards. All in all, this was a good hotel for NYC.;4
Great place to stay right where you need to be to do the sights. Staff where all great and couldn’t do enough for us, sorted our taxis as well. Its an old place so the rooms are a bit small, but its clean and well kept. Would most definitely stay again.;4
Not only is the New Yorker a classic New York hotel, but it lives up to the billing. The staff are friendly and helpful, and one feels almost as though Frank Sinatra will step around the corner any minute. It’s a classic feel with all the modern conveniences.;5
Hotel was a short walk from Times Square etc but still plenty of amenities nearby.  Slight issue on check in but this was resolved promptly.  Fabulous art deco style hotel and subway right outside.  Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are a stones throw away. Room was smallish, like most but clean and maid service was great.   Only had breakfast in the diner on the last day but food was excellent and so quick.;4
"Amazing location, hotel itself not worth price. The lobby area was gorgeous and very nice, but the upstairs hallways smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and was outdated. My room had a gorgeous view, but looked nothing like the rooms the hotel posts pictures of; it was much more outdated, the shower had dirt in between the tiles that could've been scrubbed away, and the bathroom also looks much older. It wasn't super dirty or anything, but definitely could've been cleaner, especially for the price. The TV was older and I had issues with it being so grainy at some points (not the whole time?) that I couldn't read the guide. The diner was nice. Facility fees (none of which I used -- it's basically the office and gym plus Wifi) for my 3 night stay ended up surpassing $100, which";3
Everything was great. Lovely character hotel. Staff very friendly. Very central. We had a fabulous time. Will come back. Lovely the vintage items round the hotel. Very comfortable. Beds were just perfect. Big thank you for looking after us.;5
Very good hotel, close to everything. Has restaurants to eat and bar to grab drinks. Great 24hr diner.Right in the middle of Times Square. Perfect for Broadway shows 1 block away. Close to shopping. Not far from  Central Park;4
This is one of the nicest places we have found in our travels. Harriet the desk clerk was amazing . She had to come and show us how to operate the fancy tv and was so cheerful and helpful. Cannot say enough about her and the facility .;5
Beautiful Historic Hotel in a a great location, across from Madison Square Gardens, and very close walking distance to Broadway Theatres, and Times Square. Our room had a great view of the Empire State Building  and a nice Art Deco charm. Would definitely stay  here again.;4
I had read on trip advisor to see what this hotel Was like..what I read wasn’t good so wasn’t really sure what to expect 😳when I arrived the staff where friendly an reception was very clean an tidy..the rooms are very dated but also very clean which was my main worry ..it could do with a total refurbishment in rooms but honestly I would go back as clean an I only needed somewhere to sleep ..only other problem I had before I went was ..there’s no response to any calls, emails or txt messages at all before you go I tried for 4 months but no joy..;3
Older, but iconic, New York hotel and we loved the Art Deco style.  Corridors to the bedrooms are a bit shabby but the room (albeit on the small side) was adequate - and clean.  The bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom was dated but, again, it was clean and functional.    Tik Tok diner is worth a visit.  Location is perfect.  Would definitely stay again.;4
Absolute perfect stay. Not a single thing I can fault.   Great location, hotel is very clean and stunning lobby.   Can be a bit lively at night round the hotel but no noise when in the room.   A hotel full of charm and character. Just what you want as a tourist.   Thank you to all the staff and we will see you again hopefully.;5
Busy hotel in midtown, small room (typical NYC), really basic amenities (byo toiletries) and forgetful housekeeping. Room was tiny we couldn’t unpack. Strong showers pressure was nice at the end of long day exploring NY. Check in/out was smooth though and location was great with many food options. I would stay somewhere else with bigger room next time a little farther away from the hustle and bustle;3
We stayed here for 8 days in September from UK. The hotel is in a perfect location with the main subway being a few minutes' walk away. The staff are very helpful and friendly, and the taxi back to the airport can be booked with the concierge so that you get a safe taxi ride (ALWAYS USE AUTHORISED VEHICLES TO AND FROM JFK). The staff were unbelievably good with customer service when I booked the room and gave us a room with direct view of the Empire State building AND the Chrysler which was top drawer!! The foyer is gorgeous with its Art Deco decor BUT some of the corridors and our room was a little tired. However, for the price it was totally acceptable. Staff always on hand for assistance, room always cleaned properly each day, cash machine, coffee counter in reception and;4
The New Yorker was an excellent place to stay at. The location made it very easy to get around NYC (the E line subway station is literally steps away).    The housekeeping kept our room clean and even provided a fridge upon request!  The front desk people were always willing to help at a moment’s notice when something went awry (my room key stopped working but they more than helped me out here).  The security was phenomenal and made me feel very safe at the hotel during my entire stay there.  The doorman was always polite and welcoming towards all guests of the hotel.  In short, the New Yorker Hotel is a great hotel to stay at, in a premium location right near mass transit, the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden.  I HIGHLY recommend the New Yorker to anyone visiting;5
They lost our booking as part of a large group stay. Then finally got a room only to be told it's the wrong room, so had to sit in the room whilst the staff made their way slowly to the room. No idea why this took.pvet 40 mins to sort . Hotel is terribly dated with poor facilities.;2
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in this wonderful art deco hotel, with stylish details in room and public spaces. Very convenient location in central Manhattan with great views from higher stories.  Spacious common waiting space in lobby. Sufficient elevators and no waiting. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Amenities including internet excellent; room cleaned every day.";5
Booked here to celebrate my husbands 60th - first time visit to NYC and couldn't have picked  a better location. Checked in easily, however was disappointed with room size and lack of view, then at 11pm House keeping opened our door (luckily had safety bar on) and asked why we hadn't checked out! So you may wonder why I've given it a high rating.....its how the manager dealt with my concern the following day - he apologised for intrusion and when I said I was disappointed with lack of view he said leave it with me. Put our luggage in storage (complimentary) whilst we went and explored. Upon our return he had upgraded us to a fantastic room with spectacular views from 2 windows - empire state, chryslar, new world trade centre etc - it absolutely made our stay so special and will;5
Art deco style Hotel, lobby really nice but when we got out of the lift my first thoughts were , where have we come it looked so dated and carpets needed renewing.  The room was really small with a narrow cupboard with 4 coat hangers in for clothes.  The positive side is that the bed was extremely comfy along with the pillows so we had excellent night's sleep which helped.  Location is brilliant near Madison Square Gardens and not too far from Times Square.;4
The room was clean, the staff was very polite and helpful. Lovely receptionists were at their best, so much of assistance. God bless them. Quite and a lovely restaurant with a lovely atmosphere. Pity the stay was too short.;4
Mohammed at the front desk was so helpful. I was several hours before checkin and had some calls to make and needed a quiet place. Mohammed was able to get me into my room early for a reasonable early checkin fee and I was able to get my work done!  In addition, the room itself bears a review! I stayed in a room that was a suite with a PATIO! In NYC! View of the Empire State Building from my beautiful outside perch. Best hotel stay ever in NYC!;5
We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the New Yorker. We had booked the trip for a concert at Madison Square Gard and have to say this was perfect as it was just a few steps away. Had a great corner room and loved the  beautiful view of the city.  The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. Room was a nice size by New York City standards. Would have liked a little more room in the bathroom but I guess you can’t have it all. All in all it was a great trip and we would definitely stay here again. Thank you.;5
I think it would be hard to beat the location of this hotel.  The subway is a 2 min walk from the hotel providing access to main tourist sites.  It’s also not far from Times Square on foot.   The hotel seems to undergoing some upgrades.  I paid for a room upgrade and they offered a city view room on their ‘executive floor’. Given the shape of the hotel, the view was actually a brick wall.  However, if you stood at the window and looked to the side you could see a few buildings.   The room and bathroom were small but housekeeping was efficient and the rooms were cleaned daily.;3
Location is great, and the lobby is pretty cool. Hallways are a bit dated, but as Wyndham Diamond I got upgraded to a suite with a private balcony that overlooks MSG.  Rooms had some wear but were clean, and it’s quiet. Give it a go, and you may be pleasantly surprised.;4
After after a long day of travel from The Bahamas, I expected the check-in process to be stressful but had the luxury of having a completely different experience. Mohammad was absolutely awesome, he made sure I felt at home and that things were smooth with my process. He even called up to the room to make sure I was happy. I wanted to write a review early because I know I may forget but I wanted to highlight his great hospitality. Will stay again in a heartbeat and will recommend to my colleagues.;4
For me, while the lobby was impressive, the common areas and the guest room (at least the one we had), did not impress me.   We opted for the standard view room with a queen size bed (125 sq feet). The condition of the room itself was o.k. but not great. I understand they are trying to maintain the look and feel of the iconic Art Deco style. There is limited closet space, and dresser space. The room was about a 125 sq. feet which is what they list on their website. The bathroom was very small with very little space. They painted over the bathroom tile with standard flat wall paint and it was peeling. The shower had older dated shower plumbing and it was very difficult to adjust the water temperature. There is no mini fridge, nor a microwave. The common areas on floor 21 were a;3
We love this hotel and it’s history. We stay here every time we are in NYC. May not be the fanciest, but it has old NYC charm and that is worth everything. Let’s not forget to mention the Tick Tock Diner and it’s disco fries and milkshakes!!  Super friendly staff and if your lucky a great view of the Empire State Building from your room.;5
Well we have just had the experience of a lifetime in NYC and our Hotel was a big part of that experience. The New Yorker Hotel was incredible. From the moment we arrived they could not do enough to help. Friendly check in with no issues and we managed to get a great price on an upgraded room to a suite.  The facilities there are great, the suite we had was incredible (top floor room 4003) plenty of room to relax and chill out after a long day site seeing. The views from our room were Amazing, incredible infact.  We ate at the butcher and banker restaurant on our first night located in the old bank vault in the hotel was a bit expensive but the food was incredible! The Tick Tock diner attached was a bit poor not the staff or the place just the food not good quality and highly;5
On arrival got told we had to pay a deposit fee of £215! Be aware of this on arrival, we had absolutely no idea, booked through virgin holidays and was told nothing about this. The hotel, i found was quite scary and out dated. Walls in the corridors are filthy. Ancient carpets in the hall ways and rooms. Pictures online paint a different story to what you're getting. The location of the hotel being the only positive. I was looking at the reviews while i was staying here and saw people mention a facility fee of $35 a night!!!! We went to check if this applied to us, luckily it didnt as virgin holidays cover it.   If you're staying here just be prepared to have your wallet emptied, so bring extra cash!  $5 also to store your bags for the day, not a lot but still, wow!!! How is;2
This was my first time staying at the New Yorker. The main reason why I chose this hotel was it is only one block from the train station as I would catch a train the next day. Views from my room were absolutely amazing as my room was on the 37th floor. I could see the empire state building and the Chrysler building from my room and it was so beautiful seeing the skylight lit up at night. Room was very clean and large for a New York City hotel room. I would definitely stay here again in the future;5
Awesome stay in New York, close to everything (if you are a walker!) 15 mins from Times Square... Friendly, helpful service and clean spaces. Special commendation to Afroza for going the extra mile to make sure we had a lovely stay. Thank you!;5
Just returned today after our 6th stay at this hotel.  We stayed for 8 nights and the room we were allocated had a slight issue with one of the bathrooms and the TV didn't work.  After reporting the issues we spoke to a gentleman on the desk called Driss he was extremely helpful and obliging and we were offered a different room for the next 7 nights.  We collected our new key card and found to our amazement that he had allocated us a suite Room 2530 .  It had 3 double  beds and a separate lounge area with amazing views of The Empire State on one  side and MSG from the window on the other side.  Couldn't  fault any of the staff inc the Maids  Doormen Reception etc;5
Do not believe website photos! Horrible rooms with bad AC, smoke filled hallways, creaky elevators, no lobby amenities, noisy guests at 4 am, leaking ceilings, and ripped curtains.  Bait and switch—they send you to a different building across street. Do not ruin your trip to NYC at this place!;1
The New Yorker is an iconic hotel in midtown, located roughly equidistant between Empire State and Hudson Yards/Edge and a block from Macy's and Penn Station. There will be other more luxurious hotels with arguably more modern facilities but I would always go back to the New Yorker as being friendly, comfortable and a wonderful piece of Art Deco New York history. Walking into the lobby is reminiscent of returning to the heydays of 20s and 30s New York and it is easy to imagine resplendent ladies and gentlemen attending dances in the ballroom. Rooms are very comfortable if a little tired at the edges, but clean, very comfortable beds and good working order and everything you need for a short stay. Staff could not be more helpful and when you can walk no more, the location next;5
Nice historical building. Great location, right next to the subway. When we arrived to the room maintenance was unexpectedly there. The sink in our bathroom was always clogged, so that was most likely why. Reported it to reception a few times but the issue was never fixed. It didn’t bother us much, as the pipes in the building are definitely not new, but it’s an inconvenience if you need to shave. Great views if you get a top floor room.;3
"Iv just returned from a 4 night stay here with my mum. We have been to NYC mamy times and have family here. We chose to stay here as it was an ideal location...thats where it ends.  From the min we arrived it was extra charges of nearly £200 for resort fees??? Never heard of this. Then on the morning of checkout anothe £35 for service fees? Nobody at the desk could tell me what exactly this was. Considering the price we paid for a VERY small room and the ""lack of"" facilities i think its disgusting charging this on top.  The cleaning staff are so friendly and do a great job however, the room was very small & in need of upgrading. I think they advertise as a Queensize bed - it defo is a standard double.  The lobby is beautiful but doesnt reflect on rooms unfortunatley. I think i";2
Spent 4 nights in the New Yorker with my small family and the reaction is mixed, to be honest. An old style art deco hotel in a run down area in the city. Reception was brusque and jot too welcoming, eventually our booking was found and  we got room key. Clearly there is a need for a lot of security due to surrounding area inhabited by a disturbingly large amount of homelessness. Room was small (as expected in NY) and needs updating. Beds were poor, bathroom very very small. Diner attached to hotel was welcoming, friendly and food & service was decent. Hallways and general areas of hotel needs a face-lift, but was still packed with people,mainly people going to gigs in MSG across the road. Don't think we would stay in this hotel or this area of NY again, which is a shame as its;3
Have just returned from this hotel. We chose this particular hotel following a recommendation. The hotel location was very good (just outside Penn Station) and it was very art deco in appearance. 2 adults and a 16 year old so we booked a double double room, it was very small and we struggled to accommodate our clothing and suitcases etc. The room had art deco type lights which were very dim so all lights were on when we were in the room. The window overlooked another bedroom and absolutely no view. The whole place seemed tired, they had painted the bathroom, evidence of this was paint all over the chrome towel rail which came off onto the towels. We got up one day and found that there was no water at all in the room, yes it was resolved, but three of us with no shower in NY;3
At check-in, Mohammed informed us that we had been upgraded to a family suite!  We loved the view and the extra space was very much appreciated.  The location of the hotel made it so handy to catch the subway, the LIRR, or just go for a nice walk to many of the nearby restaurants.  We feel that the few extra dollars was well worth it!;5
Everyone employed there was very helpful, friendly, and professional. Got a corner room on the 25 th floor and the view was amazing. Did not eat at the 24 hour restaurant but their desert case appeared to be top notch! I would definitely stay here again;4
I’ll start with the positives-   1) Location of the hotel is fantastic, especially if you’re seeing a show at MSG.  Well, that was quick- let’s move on to the rest: 1) hotel is super old and outdated. Rooms, beds, bathrooms, etc.. 2) it will take forever to get an elevator up to your or down to your Room. It actually might be faster walking. Factor at least 10 -15 minutes one way into your travel time 3) housekeeping - I had a family suite with 4 people. There were two bath towels in the room. I called down at 3:30 pm for more. At 11 pm I called back down for additional towels as I hadn’t received them and was told it might take a bit bc there was only one person on duty. By the time I get the towels I’ll be back home and able use my own.  4) biggest issue- I booked this room;1
It would have been a 5/5 but the first room i got given had construction vehicles on the road below that beeped for hours. I asked to change rooms. The man on the desk said a comment about being in New york which i understand as I’ve been a few times before but nobody could have slept thru that. I took a video it was bad. Anyway,after changing rooms, it was nice. Maids came everyday, the safe broke after a couple of days but it didn’t bother me. Lifts weren’t as bad as i’d read about, a few minutes wait at most. I would definitely recommend. Location is the best.;4
It was a disappointing stay, a great location but the room was overpriced and really small. We needed a roll away - which cost $50 per night- and literally no space to put it in the room. Made a small request for the room & they either forgot it’ll didn’t care. I see other people on here commenting on the dated look of the hotel. That part at least to me isn’t as big of a deal as customer service. And the New Yorker just didn’t do well in that category. I definitely wouldn’t stay there again.;1
"We only stayed 1 night but really enjoyed our time there.  The hotel has an art deco feel and reminds one of fancy balls and dinners that may have been held there. The room was small, but it just added to the hotel's overall charm.  We especially liked that we could walk to dining, shopping and the subway.  A friendly and efficient staff is always a plus, and The New Yorker certainly has that.  Overall, a GREAT experience; will definitely stay here again!";5
"Stayed here for a week in August. We are a young couple who went to go and see the sights. First thing is that the location is fantastic - about 5/10 minute walk to Times Square; 20 minutes to Central Park and about an hours walk to south Manhattan.   The hotel itself is very back dated. The lobby is lovely - big open space. The room is small but not tiny. The bathroom is possibly the worst part. Shower would spray upwards as well as downwards! The bin men at 4am every day wasn’t ideal - I’d take ear plugs!   All in all, a dated hotel in a good location.";3
The hotel was a bit old but still decent. Rooms were spacious. Front desk and staff gave good service. I got to see the room and floor Nikola Tesla stayed in that was really cool. I would stay here again. Great location in the city! Close to good spots and stores. Everything in walking distance.;4
I've just returned from a 3 night stay at The New Yorker and look forward to returning on my next visit to NYC. I had read some of the reviews mentioning the hotel being 'tired'. I didn't have that experience, my room was spacious and modern. Housekeeping did an excellent job as my room was very clean. I didn't have a view and I didn't care. I was in New York to go out and explore not sit in my room. Subway stations are nearby and I used this a lot. As well as an easy walk to The Edge, The Highline and Macys.  I used the Tick Tock diner on two occasions and enjoyed the food. Security is very tight, no one can use the lift without showing their key card. The lady that checked me in (sorry I didnt catch the name), greeted me with a big welcoming smile. She accommodated me with my;5
Great location for attending events at Madison Square Garden - right across the street! Beautiful historic building. I’ve stayed here two times in the last year when attending concerts at MSG and plan to book here again. Great value, great room, great location.;5
Couldn’t be a better location for a show at MSG than the Art Deco style New Yorker.  Super convenient too if you are taking the train or driving (garage a half block away).  Rates reasonable, recommend upgrading room size because space is small, especially the bathroom.  Room was clean, some aspects could benefit from upgrades/cosmetic refresh.  Hotel boasts a fitness area, 3 restaurants (steakhoue, Italian and diner), coffee shop within and several across the street (recommend Gregory’s).  Would stay here again for another show at the Garden.;5
All staff and employees always so welcoming and friendly. Rooms are always so clean and we love being central to everything. Have stayed here many times and always a great experience. It's our 1st choice Hotel every time.;5
Comfortable and clean hotel with friendly staff. Functional room. Very conveninetly located for Times Square and mid-town Manhattan. We very much enjoyed our stay until check out day. We were presented with a service charge to cover (we were told internet access). At check in were told it would be a nominal fee. It turned out to be $30 per day plus tax. - That is not a nominal fee and I would have happily not used the hotel wifi if I new in advance it would be that expensive.  We weren't told by our travel agent about this and whilst it was mentioned when we booked in it wasn't explicit. It's shame because without this service charge - which I feel is sneaky, expensive and actually covers things I would normally expect to be included in the price of a room - this would be a five;2
We have stayed at varied hotels whilst holidaying New York, this was the first stay The New Yorker.  The hotel dates back to 1919 and has enjoyed a lively and popular history.  We found the hotel clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and helpful especially Krystle who helped us with our boarding passes for our return journey as the printer in the Business Centre was out of ink, she was so happy to help.  Our Room was quite small (but what do need if you are only sleeping in it).  The bed and pillows were so comfortable so we slept well.  We used the hotel bar on our first night but it was a little pricey (which is to be expected in a hotel)  The hotel is so close to Penn Station which made ideal when arrived and departed.  The hotel is a little tired (but clean) but;5
The location is great. Walking distance to madison square garden, penn station and empire state builiding.   Check-in was quick and efficient. We got there at 3:00pm but room was already ready. Room was clean and had a great view of the New York skyline. Good security. Tick Tock diner access through the lobby. Great food and delicious milk shakes.  Easy driving access to and from the lincoln tunnel;5
The New Yorker is a 2-minute walk from Penn Station and is close to everything.   Room was spotless,  excellent security, spectacular views, very friendly and helpful staff.  Housekeeping did an excellent job of cleaning and making sure the room was ready.  Priced right.;5
Hotel is looking a little tired in the corridors/rooms but is spotlessly clean and the lobby area is lovely.  Had fabulous nights sleep though, really quiet, rooms dark and beds comfy...the shower was amazing.  Tick Tock Diner great for breakfast, really sets you up for the day.;5
My husband and I stayed here for 5 days celebrating his 60th Birthday.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough. From the minute we got there to the minute we left we were impressed with how helpful and friendly they were with us. The front desk were so polite with us after such a long journey from the UK ( and a 3 and a half long wait at Security in JFK along with the mass of other non-citizens, not good!!!!) and dealt with checking in quickly. Our suite was spotless and the Cleaner came in every door with fresh towels, the doorman Carlos was brilliant and hailed taxis for us. Tick Tock Diner was fab and we found the food pretty good at the end of the day  I would highly recommend this hotel, if you want friendliness,  helpfulness and in a great location with easy access to the;5
The hotel is pretty historic and that’s why we booked it. We prefer classic hotels over the more ‘trendy’ places to stay. The lobby is beautiful and the staff were fine. However, once we got up to the 21st floor we started getting some ‘Hotel Cecil’ vibes. Dark hallways, small and dated rooms. Looks like it hasn’t really been touched up since it was built.   That being said, we enjoyed our stay and it served its purpose of being a place to sleep while we explored the city. The location is pretty great especially if, like us, you’re looking to jump on the Amtrak and visit another city after NYC. The New Yorker is right next to Penn Station.   Overall, a little creepy, but it does the job.;3
Stayed at the new yorker great hotel we got the air train then subway from jfk and we didn't have far to go as it stopped right outside the hotel.we didn't have a view but we wasn't in the room long enough to benifit a view..room was big with 2 big beds and 2 bathrooms bonus as we could be ready and out without waiting for each other Hotel is within waljin distance to a lot of places  maddison Square gardens very close..tick tock diner worth a visit..staff great...would definitely recommend this hotel..we already looking into booking for next year;5
My husband and I really enjoyed this hotel!! The service was textbook hospitable. We received great recommendations from the gentleman at reception (I can remember his name and I wish I had asked!) We can’t wait to be back!;5
We stayed here for three nights and overall it was very good. The room on the 24th floor was a little on the small side but had a great view of Manhattan and the Hudson.  The room looked a little tired and could have done with a lick of paint but that could be overlooked due to other factors. Using the lifts was a major source of entertainment as it usually meant a long wait to get an elevator going the way you wanted. Staff were always friendly and helpful. The location next to Madison Square Garden and only a block or so from Macy's and the Empire State Building is excellent and left reasonably short walks to all amenities. A subway entrance is right next to the hotel. An enjoyable stay and would love to go back.;4
Amazing service with Mohammed and beautiful and clean room. The room have a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. The People who work their are so nice and give a great service. Best hotel with a great worker Mohammed.;5
Hotel was quieter than on previous visits found staff to be a lot friendlier than usual housekeeping staff have always been helpful but found staff on reception to be helpful and friendly this visit . Upgraded to a suite for a fee never been offered this before and could avail of a late check out again for a fee but it was nice to have as we had an evening flight;5
We stayed on the 39th floor. We enjoyed and beautiful  view. The midtown location was convenient and close to other places we walked. The staff were all friendly. The doormen were welcoming, helpful, and entertaining. The security staff were attentive. The room and entire hotel that we saw was clean.;5
After reading reviews about the size of the rooms, at check in we enquired into a larger room. We were offered a suite with a balcony at a very reasonable cost. The room was a little dated but the size and the view from the balcony more than made up for that. To the left was a view of the Empire State building to the right buildings and a glimpse of the Hudson River. We often look McDonald's iced drinks onto the balcony after a long day!!  You need to show a key card to a staff member to gain access to the lifts one side  to floor 20 the other side 21-40!!!  The hotel is in a great location for Times Square, Broadway and the subway. Would definitely take a walk along the highline. Lots of places nearby to buy souvenirs and snacks. New York in general felt a little unpredictable,;5
Perfect hotel for our vacation! We loved absolutely everything about it. The location, the fantastic room, the extremely friendly staff. Or room was even upgraded upon check in. Everything was perfect!;5
This hotel is old school NY. Staff is so friendly. Lobby and rooms are beautifully decorated. Convenience of the diner and local restaurants. And it’s not out of price range as most hotels in this area tend to be. I loved it here and will def be back!;5
Staff friendly, and checked key on entering, so felt safe. Hotel as described- location perfect- across from Penn Station (3 stops from Newark airport $15.50 single ticket, and Subway to all over city $33 for 7 day ticket- buy in Subway from ticket machine.  Plenty shops around hotel- for tourist merch and drinks/snacks. Also lots places to eat- from Tik Tok Dinner in hotel, to budget breakfasts at Macdonald's across from hotel, and Dunkin Donuts around corner. We also went to Irish sports bar Jack Doyle's just across street and around corner for dinner- very good food / service & inexpensive.  Room was serviced daily- beds made, towels renewed and toiletries replenished. Our room didn't have fridge but had ice bucket and ice machine on next floor.  Room could do with being;4
Worst Experience EVER! They ruined our Honeymoon!  Reservation was done via Booking.com (with a good offer/price) over 1 Month ago. Upon arriving at the Hotel they told us that the price given by Booking.com is not acceptable by them! They insisted that it was a systematical error by Booking.com and the Hotel but they told me that I SHOULD SOLVE this issue with Booking.com!!! Booking.com apologized and only did cancellation free of charge … After that we had to find a new hotel -last minute-. The cherry on top is that they increased the prices nearly to a double-price and after 2 days they made a special offer via Booking.com.  Be alerted and DON’T make your reservations in this Hotel.  - Rude staff - Staff that could hardly speak English - Non-Professional;1
is an excellent choice for travelers visiting New York, offering a luxurious environment along with many services designed to enhance your stay.  Close to most of New York's landmarks, such as Love Sculpture (0.8 km) and Manhattan Skyline (1.1 km), Hotel New York Marriott Marquis is a great destination for tourists.;4
Great location, history and staff. High pressure shower and newly decorated rooms! It’s a great hotel. Staff were knowledgeable, attentive and professional. Right opposite the train station. Easy to get to JFK.;5
Nice Hotel, rooms are very outdated need some painting and fixing here and there… Perfect location, beautiful lobby, staff is friendly, super nice and helpful! Food is good too , our family room didn’t have coffee maker which is very inconvenient.;4
Firstly the hotel was very clean and well kept including the rooms. The front desk staff were very helpful in giving us tips for getting around the city and also getting us a transfer back to the airport. The standard rooms are a bit dated and basic but are absolutely fine for a short stay or if you are out for most of the time and just need somewhere to rest. The cleaners come in every day and do a good job. I’d definitely recommend if you need a short stay hotel for a few days in NYC.;4
Fantastic location but the room was very dated (28th floor) and very small, we were a family of 4 and there was no room to walk around the beds. There was also very little room to store clothes or toiletries,there was a shelf in the bathroom but it was very narrow and at a slant so everything fell in the sink. No tea and coffee facilities in the room but there is a McDonald's across the road which is open 24hrs so that was great for us. I wouldn't stay here again due to the small rooms and the outdated-ness of it all but for location it ticks all the boxes;3
Great hotel! Great location!  Bedroom was a good size. Bed was comfortable.   Room was clean.   close to all necessary amenities. Good restaurants in walking distance.  walking distance to the subway station;3
Rooms are too small and no counter space in bathroom for personal products. Products were either placed on the ground, or on the toilet seat. I will not stay here again, nor will I recommend this to any one.;2
Hotel was fine and the staff was very helpful - I would not go to NY unless you have to. People are peeing and taking craps right on the side walk. People have snack tables set up all over the sidewalks to sell drugs. So many homeless and people with metal health issues all around the hotel. City is not safe;4
We spent 11 nights at New Yorker hotel. We lived in renovated room, in 31st floor. Room was clean, with very confortable mattress, with good AC, clean bathroom including new sink, WC and shower. Every day room was cleaned and towels was changed as often as we wanted. Room has all needed perks as coffee machine (got additional coffee tablets every day), safe, TV with more than needed channels, mini fridge, bathroom amenities as shampoo, shoer gel, conditioner, soap, hair dryer, bath robe.  Yes, the room was tiny, but we fit. :) as our goal was to spent time in New York City not in the hotel room it was more than enough. The location is perfect, basically everywhere can go by foot.  Sadly hotel do not have breakfast and not providing any discounts for guests for Tick Tock Diner;4
A bit disappointed with the hotel this time, stayed 6 years ago with my husband and had a fantastic room, was really spacious and clean, unfortunately not so this time, we were on floor 20 and felt like we were in a converted storage room, 2 double beds with barely enough room to move around, extremely dated compared to last time,looked like the room hadn’t been decorated in years. Pokey bathroom with a bath you couldn’t possibly lay down in and a shower that if you were taller than 5ft had to bend over backwards to wash your hair, grubby skirting boards and paint peeling off the walls, floor never got hoovered in the time we were there. Overall can’t say I’d recommend this hotel and if we visit New York again think we will stay elsewhere;3
The best thing about this hotel is its location and proximity to public transportation. The hotel itself is historic but needs an update particularly in the bathrooms. We had booked three standard rooms: two with queen size beds and one with two twin beds. The rooms with a queen size bed are much smaller than the ones with two twins. In this hotel it really makes a big difference! The mattress and pillows are not the best ones (forgot to take our own pillows with us), and none of us (6 altogether) slept very well. The bathrooms are very tiny, outdated and have no space for your things unless you want to keep them on the floor. The staff were friendly enough.;3
Great value for money, excellent location and very friendly staff. We had a room on the 32nd floor for three nights and had a lovely view towards the Hudson. The room was very clean if a little dated but for the money and location we would definitely recommend it.;5
The New Yorker was everything I expected it to be. For the price you get decent rooms and good service.  It looks like used to be very fancy but hasn’t been updated in a while. From the 23rd floor we could see a lot of Manhattan including the Empire State Building.;5
We asked to check in early and they asked for a fee of $70 then they reduced to $50.  If we don’t want to pay for early check in then we have to pay for luggage storage.  The room does not have coffee machine or the refrigerator.  If we want to have those items, we have to pay additional for each item!  The location is a couple blocks from Penn station and 10-15 min walk to Koreantown or Timesquare which is convenient.  Overall, I wouldn’t recommend unless you are willing to pay for those additional fees!;3
We have been to this local pub quite a few times now. David is a great host along with very friendly staff with lots of smiles.  We have had steaks tonight and they are very tasty and very well presented. We recommend the set menu for great value at £11.99 for two courses.  Great food and great staff would I eat here again- yes definitely- but don’t spread the work or we risk not getting a table!;5
Mohamed at the Customer Service was fantastic! He went out of the way to be accommodating to our needs and gave exceptional service! Made us feel valued. The other customer service personnel and the rest of the staff we interacted with were great too. A very pleasant experience!;4
This was very bang average. The cheaper rooms (still $500-600 per night) are very small. The bathroom is rather unremarkable and small. It also doesn't offer any sizeable shampoo or shower gel. As well as this, there is a very loud aircon that will either keep you awake or (when turned off) the heat will do the same. For this amount of money my three night could have been better spent.   * * *;3
We loved everything about the hotel, particularly the location and view of the city from our spacious room. We were visiting New York to attend a concert in Madison Square garden (Billy Joel), and this is just across the road from the hotel, which was so convenient and really added to the enjoyment of the concert. A fabulous experience  - we will be back!;5
"I stayed for a week during the summer in a queen sized bedroom. Comfortable room with functioning AC and several lights you can choose to turn on. The shower head I had wasn't the greatest (less of a shower and more like four faucets shooting water at you) and you might have to spend a few seconds mixing and matching the hot and cold water to get the heat you want, but it had good pressure and got the job done so nothing really major to complain about. Housekeeping are WONDERFUL and made my stay twice as good, they were timely and they were kind in my experience. As a tourist it's very well connected; there's a subway right around the corner, Times Square is just a 10 minute walk away and there's a wealth of shopping districts and food places that are very close, including Tick";5
Even being one of New York's older Hotels, our stay was fabulous and very clean. The beds were above what we expected and even a refrigerator that actually cooled well. Three great restaurants on site and one is even open 24hrs a day. I will defiantly stay here again!;4
"If you are a fan of retro vibes, the lobby and elevator alone might get you excited.  The hotel is next to Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, Moynihan Train Hall, and other big hubs.  We very much enjoyed our stay, with the locaion being the biggest draw for us.  You are walking distance from Times Square; but not in the middle of it.  You're still in busy Manhattan; but it's a little nicer.";5
This Art Deco hotel has interesting public areas but our room was very poor with a tiny en suite.  8th Avenue around the hotel leaves a lot to be desired. The Tik Toc diner and the Trattoria were reasonable but overpriced.  Close to Penn Station so if you’re travelling by train, perhaps it’s OK.;3
Amazing hotel, location was fab right next to penn station and subway. Had a view of the Empire State from our room on the 29th floor. Room was a double double so plenty of room. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful and hotel was clean and perfect for what we needed.;5
We stayed again at the New Yorker in mid-town. Great access to every part of Manhattan, and our view in the premium suite was amazing. Lots of history (we stayed in Tesla’s room the first trip) and a three great restaurants on site.;5
Smells of smoke on some floors and rooms. Very outdated needs an uplift but clean and great location. Was there for my 50th Birthday and didn’t get off to a good start due to having to change rooms due to smoke smell;3
Hotel rooms not clean, really small. Had to move because sink was cracked. Some staff were really nice others rude. Bed clothes and towels were flithy. No space for cases once in the room. Lobby is the nicest part of hotel;1
This was my 7th stay in this hotel and I will not stay anywhere else now. The location of this hotel is perfect. It’s right in the heart of midtown, on the corner of 34th street & 8th Avenue. It’s an old hotel but has a nice feel to the place. The reception is very big and grand. The staff are all very friendly. There is security checking key cards as you enter the elevator area. The rooms are a good size for what you want and need in New York. We had a good size bathroom, a walk-in closet with a safe, a double bed and a TV. I would definitely recommend this hotel;5
Great location and friendly staff, however the hotel itself and rooms are very dated, grubby in places and could do with an update. Rooms get a cursory once over but could do with a deep clean. Also no tea/coffee making facilities in rooms.;3
Check in and check out went very smooth.  This hotel is directly across the street from busy Penn Station and a short walk to the shows on Broadway, shopping and food options.  It's a very busy area so be prepared for crowds.  Security checked for key cards before allowing anyone near the elevators so that was an added level of safety we appreciated,  We stayed in an older section of the hotel that wasn't renovated yet and the mattresses definitely needed replacing as they were too soft.  That was my fault as they were clear about it up front and I tried to save a few bucks.  Next time I'll pay the extra $10/night and stay in a renovated room so my back doesn't ache when I get up.;4
To all Scandinavian and European tourists do not stay at The New Yorker hotel! They have over billed my stay with more than USD 1,100. I settled everything when I left the hotel and was according to the receipt handed out promised a refund of  USD 329. Instead, they invoiced me an additional USD 831 after I asked for the refund.  They do not write back and when calling there is no proper answer to get.   Please spread the message to anybody you know so they can avoid being over billed by The New Yorker Hotel.   Also, worthwhile having in mind The New Yorker Hotel is placed in a bad neighborhood with a lot of homeless junkies in the street so not a pleasant place to walk home with your family in the evening.;1
Old but good hotel . Room size ok . Bathroom bigger compared to other hotels . Amazing location . Restaurant has variety of options. Again , compared to thee hotels , staff is better , helpful and pleasant. Looks like one of the 60s premium hotel . Value for money .;4
I enjoyed the location and the hotel staffs hospitality.  Easy to get to and close to most popular NYC landmarks - Times Square, Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Penn Station and the subway.;5
I now know where I’ll be staying when I visit NYC in the future! I can’t imagine staying anywhere else, now, after having stayed at the New Yorker. It was gorgeous, clean, and everyone was very kind, friendly, and professional.;5
"The building is excellent and traditional from the period. However, extra facilities and charges for extras like coffee that are standard in most hotels, let the hotel down. The lack of welcome pack was unusual; I received a key card and directions, there was no further contact until I checked out.";3
Hotel was good, staff were friendly. Shame they took over $100 as an unauthorised payment from my card and then to add to it I can’t contact anyone, only email is for reservations, which they don’t answer or a phone number that won’t connect! Why is that??;2
I have planned my holiday from Abroad Vacations, everything was well, lined-up. I have planned for 6 days 5 nights New York package. So we booked from TripAdvisor.  As a whole it  was well organised. We had smooth Airport transfers from both side. Besides that we had our tickets booked for several activities which were shared in timely manner. Next trip I will take from TripAdvisor side only.;5
It's right next to Penn Station and Madison Square garden, so across the street from the subway that you can take all the way to LaGuardia and down to the World Trade Center, as well as other routes. Just south of Times Square.  Otherwise, it is an older high rise building, I would guess 90 years old. Not sure it was ever deluxe and there's some deferred maintenance.  Rooms are small - at least mine was, and they told me that they upgraded me from an even smaller room.  The upkeep and maid service is good, however.  Wyndham management means its got the shampoo, conditioner, handcream, soaps, decent cable TV, safe and wi-fi.  No frills like minibars or anything like that, no guidebook to the hotel or city or anything.  Decent place if you really intend to spend most of your time;4
Stayed for 5 nights, the hotel is perfectly placed for exploring NYC  Its right next to Penn Station and easy walking distance to times square etc.  Has a great 24hr diner on site called Tick Tock.  Great art deco interior,  Room was clean and the staff really helpful We will be staying again!;5
Excellent location, we were able to get the train from the airport straight to penn station which was next door. It was nice and quiet at night, little to no noise. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom could be a bit more modern but overall it was great.;4
I frequently visit the New Yorker hotel and would not stay anywhere else. The consistent and personalized service is incomparable.  Id like to specifically thank Raquel,Janet, Carmen, Wen, Kuya Edward (housekeeping).  I would also like to thank the front desk Aniana, Samira, Afroza, Linda and Jose S (luggage) which has served me, my family and my guests alike. The staff assured my safety and comfort from the door to the floor.  This place is centrally located,  affordable, safe and convenient.;5
After checking out of a hotel where the TV stand was touching the bed, we landed at the Wyndham. Our Reservation lady Mrs. Akter, was kind, loving, understanding, making our stay enjoyable and memorable. .;5
Best experience because of its location and service. The environment is friendly and the art deco style gives glamour and transports you.  Next to the subways to take you uptown or downtown in minutes. I would return without any doubt.;5
I am visiting NY for a business meeting and I must say this hotel has a Wonderful location with Penn station nearby, The hotel staffs are really very friendly and eagerly helped me with all my queries. One of the best hotels in NY to consider for a long or a short stay.;5
Overall everything was fine, friendly staff, especially in reseption. Doormen were very helpful too. Room was clean and spacious. There was fridge and closet which was great. Floor 35 with spectacular views!;4
Amazing location, amazing hotel. The staff were warm and friendly, our room was spacious and had an amazing view. 10 minutes walk from Empire State and 5th avenue. 2 minutes to MSG and 10 minutes to Times Square. You couldn’t get better. The tick tock diner was for us personally a bit of a let down after reading other reviews but other than that we would/will stay here again 100%.;5
Great location for getting around New York. Hotel was a little tired looking we had a Queen room which was a little small for 2 adults, but was in a good location and experienced no noise which was a bonus. Restaurants on site were good and convenient and the information desk team knowledgeable;4
It is a fantastic location. The staff are very friendly and helpful,  especially Mohammed at check-in.  The bathroom needs more shelf space.  The rooms were cleaned early and were well done. I would stay here again.;5
Reservation and check in was great.  The Location was perfect, and I felt secure even coming in late in the night.  I unfortunately was over charged and a week later, I am still waiting on my account to be corrected. Looking forward to hearing from someone.;3
I have never experienced such good and pleasant service the hotel is an older but fully functional hotel but nice view good gym I will definitely go again really really Nice  Everything is Close by visit Them;5
We went to Manhattan and stayed at the New Yorker Hotel.  We have been there before and love the style and atmosphere and design.  They house the Tik Tok Diner which is a great and reasonably priced family restaurant.  Our room was a two bedroom suite and very spacious.  We had asked and hoped for a better view - last time we had a great view of the Empire State Building - but can't get everything.  We went to see Beetlejuice.  The New Yorker is convenient to all of the theater district.  It also has great subway access, the 34th Street Station is right there.  Hoped on the subway and it was a ten minute ride up to the Museum of Natural History, which we always wanted to see.  We had a minor plumbing issue in the bathroom that didn't get resolved but it was a weekend and did not;4
Nice hotel very good location staff were very helpful. Stayed here for 3 nights beginning of June lots of iconic NY landmarks on your doorstep the Empire State round the corner and not far from Times Square. Subway just at the side of the hotel and rail links to JFK just a 2 min walk away. Had a fabulous stay room was clean and comfortable nice diner on site too. First visit to this fabulous city can’t wait to return and would most definitely stay at the New Yorker again.;5
We stayed for a week at the New Yorker, the hotel is located opposite Madison Square Gardens. The room was a bit dated but a decent size, the view wasn't the best as we were at the back of the hotel and you could see the Edge attraction but at the end of the day we only spent time in the room sleeping as we were out all day. The Tick Tock diner was really good and the food was tasty, the hotel staff were very friendly and we liked the fact that security always checked to see if you were a guest before entering the lifts. The hotel is also close to the subway and a wee walk to Times Square. We went to Liberty Bagels for breakfast as they're was a great selection of bagels and cream cheese. We went to Hells Kitchen area for our evening meals, lots of choices as well. We would stay;4
"The hotel is tired and needs updating. It's not up to the standard of modern hotels and it feels like it's stuck in the 70s / 80s. Some staff were unhelpful and unwilling to think for themselves; however others were very helpful. Overall it was a poor experience for the money. There are much better New York hotels for the same price.";2
The room was so small, one of us had to leave the room and close the door so the other person could get out. The staff was wonderful, and we felt very safe. I expected it to be a smaller room since the hotel is so antiquated, but we could barely move in the room.;3
This hotel is certainly comfortable, and is in a central location within walking distance of many of the key NY attractions and close to the subway too, but it is a bit tired. In particular our bathroom was very dated and in need of a refresh. We didn’t use the restaurants (apart from a quick coffee at Tick Tock - weirdly served in metal mugs!) so I can’t comment on the wider facilities. It’s an underwhelming hotel but is clean and serves a purpose as a place to lay your head.;3
Hotel is run down and needs renovation.  Also, they cannot accommodate a feather allergy. We were told at the front desk that this 40-floor hotel has never encountered someone with a feather allergy and could not provide feather-free bedding. Feather-free room is a standard checkbox and in my customer profile as a request at both Hilton and Marriott hotels, but apparently the Wyndham has never heard of such a thing. Front desk staff did commit to sending housekeeping up in the afternoon to try to see what they could do, but they never showed.  Superior customer care could have overcome the tiny room with the rundown bathroom, but it was not to be.;3
The location of the hotel was excellent. The room was small but clean. The room rates were higher but to be expected because it's high-peak season in the summer in NYC. Overall, we had a great stay at the hotel.;5
Stayed here with my friend for 5 nights, check in was great staff very friendly and let us check in slightly early which was nice after a long flight. Slightly disappointed with room size (Rm 2141) and view but it was okay, we had 2 double beds and we were not in the room much although I wish we had asked for an upgrade like others did but we still enjoyed our stay. The location is fantastic and I loved the history of the hotel which you can read about downstairs, the staff were all very pleasant and approachable and security was good as you cannot access the lifts without showing your room cards. We only ate in the Tick Tock Diner once but the food was good and the service was great. We would definitely return to the hotel but I would like a bigger room next time.  It’s a great;4
The staff are very friendly, especially Linda, she greets you with her smile and goes above and beyond to help you out! The lobby is huge and the atmosphere at the hotel makes you feel comfortable because there are always people checking in and out of the hotel. The building is historical and the location is close to everything.;4
The hotel is located in a great location in Manhattan. Subways are on the block. Easy access to just about any attraction that NYC has to offer. Spacious lobby. Restaurant has the old-time diner's charm, very family friendly. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Room rates are decent for such a great location. Make sure you book it on the hotels' webiste or with it's staff to get better rates. Third-party platforms can be a rip-off. I booked from reservations.com first. It hid the hurrendous surcharges. I cancelled it at a cost, but booked again directly from the hotel's website, got assistance from the hotel staff who were super helpful and friendly. In the end, I save money as compared with the louse reservations.com.;5
The art-deco design is beautiful throughout the property.  We stayed in the family suite and were very pleased with the beds and the two full baths, which was great when traveling with teens. And because it's an older building, the original walls are thick and keep noise out very well. Location is great.  Walking distance to subway, Empire State Building, Edge building, Times Square, and Broadway.  There are three restaurants on-site, but only tried the Tick Tock diner.;5
We came into Penn Station on the train and only had an overnight layover.  We opted for the New Yorker hotel because of it's proximity to Penn Station as our train left early the next morning.  The hotel is conveniently located about 1 1/2 blocks from Penn Station.  When we entered the hotel, the staff was very friendly, welcoming, and willing to help with whatever we might need.  The room was clean, well supplied, and the view from the balcony was amazing.;5
I can not say enough kind words about the staff at the New Yorker Hotel, especially front desk worker Neda who assisted me both over the phone and in person to ensure the ease of our stay. It was right where we needed to be and the whole experience was overall positive!;5
New Yorker is my favorite NYC hotel with inexpensive prices for very clean rooms, friendly staff & the ease of being next to Moynahan & PENN station. Its in the middle of Manhattan within walking distance of anything you need & the Hudson River. Anything you need in the hotel a call away & everyone I have ever come across was friendly & willing to help in my many stays over the years. Room service is provided by the Tick Tock Diner & it’s open 24/7. Most of the rooms are updated yet still feature the unique Art Deco decor which was so popular when the hotel was built. The TV & cable aren’t that great yet if your going to NYC to watch TV, well enjoy.;4
Our New Yorker Hotel experience was awesome. GREAT staff, beautiful property and everyone was so professional and polite. The property is older but upgrades are being made. We felt safe and the location was ideal for everything we wanted to do.;5
Check in problems with no fee card. Had to use mastercard incurring conversion fee. Charges were confusing as they were charged, refunded and charged again. Hotel and service was fine but a little noisy even from floor 24. Overall ok;3
Exceeded my expectations. Small room as I am accustomed to in NYC but was so pleased when I got there in terms of cleanliness and comfort. Had a grueling car trip from Virginia and was very tired. Slept very comfortably and very refreshed the next morning.;5
Clean, safe, friendly, comfortable, and very convenient location. Right across from train station so it was a super easy walk from train to hotel. Check-in isn’t until 4pm, but you can store your luggage there before check-in for a small fee.;4
We will definitely stay here again! This hotel has so much history and the fact that was the hotel were the great Nikola Tesla stayed. Our room was in the same floor that he stayed  we loved the experience.;5
The hotel is located in the center of Manhattan. Everything is at walking distance. What else you need in New York! The rooms are clean and decent. There is a long queue at check in but it is very fast. Very good house keeping services.;4
Amazing experience. Staffs are very friendly. Initially we thought the staff is rude, but later realized that very helpful and friendly. Thanks to Krystal. First time to NY. Subway station is only few steps away. They offered us a free upgrade to a suite which was amazing. Beautiful view and balcony outside. The 2 double bed room was little congested. Plenty of elevators. Overall very nice. Thanks New Yorker.;5
Absolutely wonderful stay for my company. Staff were very friendly and attentive. The events manager was such a pleasant man and super nice. Hotel food was delicious and plenty of it! Great central location, about a 10 minute walk to Empire State, Times Square and the edge. Stayed in the suite room on the 40th floor and the views of Manhattan were incredible. Felt like I was in a palace! Rooms were very clean and immaculate. Security at the hotel is very good, they make sure you have your room card as soon as you enter the elevators to go up. The only disadvantage I would say is that you have to wait a long time for the elevators as it stops on almost every floor. Thank you very much for the stay and would definitely recommend to anyone whether it’s couples/families/business.;5
I have stayed in this busy hotel many times.  It’s convenient to airports, railroads, subways and buses, and is affordable compared to many others in Midtown.  It has an Art Deco look that’s much nicer than the modern steel-and-glass cookie-cutter newer places.  What makes The New Yorker special, however, is its staff.  In my most recent stay I arrived much earlier than the check-in time on a hot day.  My room wasn’t ready - but Mohammed at the front desk worked extra-hard to find one that was so I could relax out of the heat and hubbub.  When I told him how delighted I was, he said: “If you’re happy, we’re happy.”  That’s the essence of great customer service.  Five stars!;5
We had a disasterous trip getting to New York because of cancellations, delays and then lost luggage on top of it. We arrived at the hotel around 1pm knowing that check in time wasnt until 4. We just wanted somewhere to put our shopping bags (full of clothes we had to buy since we were missing our luggage). Mohammed offered to check us in early which literally made our day because we needed to rest a bit. It was like the only part of our trip that went well, so it made a big difference. People complain about the smallness of the rooms but I thought it was cute and it gave it a little New York twist. We visted the Tick Tock diner next door for dinner and ended up staying until midnight drinking wine :) All we had to do after that was walk up to our room and go to sleep! Thank you!;5
Do not waste your time staying at a Wyndham property in New York City. Of all my years of travel, the rudest experience was at Wyndham properties. We were supposed to stay at another Wyndham property that was overbooked. My Mother-in-law booked with points and all the reviews were correct we came in at 11:30 at night. No rooms even though she confirmed with them that day we had rooms. Then we went to their sister property which they said we had for two nights. not true only one. We ended up having to pay. The managers were all rude every one of them. They treated us like dirt. Had to argue to get our rooms, and keep our rooms. I am telling you to save your points, pay money and go to a Hilton or Marriot. Don't waste your time or money with any Wyndham property in  New York. The;1
I was very disappointed in the quality of my room. The mattresses were the old spring style and the room was dated. Even the bathroom was too small and outdated too. Also the came with no amenities. After letting what I had  sink in for a couple of had to check out and find another hotel. I refused to stay in a room of that quality on my first trip to New York City.;2
Rooms were very small and everything looked old.  The TV looked like a model from 2008 and was very small as well.  Never turned it on.  It felt like I was in a hostel rather than a hotel room.  Definetly not worth the price;2
The service was great, help in front of the hotel with the car, checkin all great. Rooms are not too big, but cosy and all clean, even a bit old. Position of the hotel is center Manhatten, so good in the middle of everything;5
Our room was perfect for the 3 of us. We had an alcove with a couch besides the 2 double beds. Our granddaughter slept on the couch. Room 722. Amenities were good and great location for subways Restaurants were good especially coffee shop. Only problem we had was with our maid who kept forgetting to leave coffee. Had to call housekeeping.;4
Great location across from Penn Station and Madison Square, Gardens easy to get anywhere from here the rooms are small but nice. Staff was friendly. Hotel was clean. Parking is nearby with a discount.;4
Everyone was very friendly and helpful, Sleeping accommodations was nice The attached restaurant ( TIC TOCK ) was excellent. The view of New York  from our room was excellent, The only thing needed was Valet.;5
Excellent hotel, excellent location, clean rooms , great for exploring nyc ,coffee and fridge in room could not of asked  for anything better  5 stars would recommend, close to subway and bars ,restaurants  shops ,;5
Excellent hotel. The staff and rooms are fantastic. We were able to sleep an extra person in a pull out armchair. Only complaint is road noise but this could only be rectified with double glazed windows;5
amazing city view with liberty statue. affordable price at a core location. Very next to Penn station, probably the closest one. Absolutely a 3 star and above hotel.  the services are very professional and friendly.;5
The New Yorker is a classic old hotel. The rooms are small like most NYC hotels, but the facilities were clean and comfortable. The staff were welcoming and helpful. Of course my fave part of the hotel is the Tick Tock Diner!;4
I was stuck in New York because of a train scheduling problem going back to Washington, DC. The hotel was close to the terminal and the name WYNDHAM is so iconic, it seemed like a save haven.   The check-in was welcoming. They found a room for me with no notice and got me the best rate they could.   This hotel lived up to the Wyndham name and I would stay there again (with a reservation next time.);4
A good hotel for visiting NYC.  Near two subway stations and two nice restaurants in the hotel.  Friendly staff and excellent housekeepers. A  Friend and I stayed here for 5 nights with tour group.  Remodeled older hotel with Art Deco design.;5
Upon arrival there was no valet parking offered, and the front of the hotel normally used for unloading luggage was blocked off forcing us to find parking nearby and carry our luggage.  The room was tiny, we had to climb over our bed to get to the other side of our room and there was nothing stopping a child from opening a window, climbing out and falling 20 stories.  The bathroom was terrible. Rusty faucets, broken handles and linen that smelled awful but thankfully the water was very hot, and the fresh towels we requested arrived promptly and smelled far better.  The staff were all friendly and courteous, the exception being the man who was requiring everyone to produce a room key before being allowed to use the elevators. He was short, rude, and forced us to produce them even;2
The hotel is placed in the center of manhattan, with the metro station at a couple of metres away from the door, so it's perfect for a NY visit.  All of the staff I had to deal with was great, professional and kind. The hotel is a bit old maybe, but everything was clean and well maintained, the only downside probably was the room, clean, nice but a bit tiny. I would return in this hotel;4
For a hotel in Midtown, it was perfect. What I mean by that is that most Midtown hotels don't have free coffee in the room and a lot of the perks people are used to these days. But the staff is great, there is a small Cafe in the lobby area for coffee and snacks, and the history of the place is one-of-a-kind. If you are looking for an interesting stay with staff that stays on top of security and housekeeping, I recommend The New Yorker.;4
When we arrived our room was ready, but it was quite dirty. The bathroom had stains, especially the shower curtain. I was also charged an extra $200 when I checked in, and when I showed my receipt saying I’d paid in full the man insisted. We’d already paid, and I couldn’t afford to go to another hotel. I just feel so ripped off.;2
Received a warm welcome and directed to very comfortable and adequate room. Location ideal as next to Penn Station and able to make transfer from Newark Airport easily and very affordable. The variety of eating options also appreciated. Felt security was good.;5
Room is small but it is perfect for a short visit to NYC. I even had space for work in the desk. Miguel from Front Desk was super helpful and friendly, great to see super nice people in a big and high volume hotel. It was my first time at the hotel, I go very often to NYC for work and I will definitely stay here again.;5
Convenient position. Near Penn station. Clean, comfortable hotel with staff on duty 24/7. Free local and international calls from room. Free wi fi. Printer available. All hotel facilities you'd expect. Great coffee and croissant available in the lobby in the morning. Friendly staff. Good security. Rooms cleaned daily. Enjoyed my stay.;4
Location is perfect! It’s near subway and train stations. Restaurants are walking distance from hotel. Broadway, Times Square too! Right across my room are the view of Madison Square, Empire State Building and Rockefeller Centre.;4
The New Yorker proved to be a nice stay. It’s not a 4 star hotel, but for the price it offers a great location with instant access to The subway. The staff was excellent and bent over to take care of us.;4
If I could rate this hotel with zero stars I would. My stay at the The New Yorker was by far one of the worst experiences I've had period. And as a frequent business traveler this says.   First, I tried to cancel my reservation a week in advance due to schedule changes. Commonly happens in business. To my surprise however The New Yorker would not issue a refund or a credit for a future stay or even allow me to reschedule. For this reason alone, I will never stay at The New Yorker or a Wyndham property ever again, for business or personal travel.   To matters worse, the hotel itself is a run down, dilapidated hotel. The elevators were incredibly slow. The hallways are dirty, in disrepair and have a moldy smell. The rooms are tiny, all the trim and door frames are all banged up;1
"This hotel is a nightmare. In the ""value for money"" scale, this place scores negative. Where to start... It's an old ruin. The fact that besides the lobby, everything is broken and smells weird. Wi-Fi couldn't be worse and it doesn't reach the ""business center"" where people are expected to work (which, on the other hand, it's just a tiny 70's-like office with 3 desks). But the worst of all are probably the lifts. So few of them for such a big hotel with hundreds of rooms. I was in floor 29 and in rush hour it could easily take 15-20 minutes to get to the lobby. There was a fire at the hotel during my stay and nobody was able to provide any information on what was happening. The key stopped working literally 5 times during the week and got to get it fixed everytime. Insane.";1
Even on the 20th floor, I could hear every shout on the street, every horn, every siren, all the construction, every door slam in the hallway, every conversation in the neighboring rooms. The shower went from hot to scalding to cold over and over in the space of a 15 minute shower. No refrigerators in the room, toilet was so short it was hard to get up.;2
very comfortable beds good view from room excellent location next to msg and penn station handy for subway only ate at tick tock once was good enough. only downside sometimes a long wait for lifts/elevator would definitely come back mainly due to the location;4
Stayed here for 6 nights, very close to the Penn station, convenient to travel, easy and quick to check in and check out, free wifi and good connection , for the Tick Tock restaurant, like breakfast, Sure, will come back;5
"We had an overnight stay at the New Yorker. It is a classic older hotel that has been well-maintained and has a historic vibe to it. It is located close to the Amtrak station, to which we were riding. If in NYC again, we will consider the New Yorker Hotel. Our stay was booked as part of a vacation package; so we don't exactly know how much the room cost.";5
Didn’t know there was a fire on our floor until the firemen starting knocking on guest doors. Had to huddle in room until they got it out. No word or discount from management. At least we weren’t physically injured.;1
Stayed here early June and totally satisfied with everything, the staff were very helpful and couldn’t do enough for us, would definitely stay here again and hope to with the children.  Some time soon. Thank you very much.;5
The Newyorker has removed all coffee makers and refrigerators from the rooms and if you want one they charge you $25-$30 per day per item.  Very frustrating!!!!  Note the room was nice as were the staff but I expect a coffee maker in the room.;2
Been to better, been to worse, very old fashioned hotel. Italian restaurant attached very good. My main gripe is that when you check in, £120 was taken from my bank account using my registered credit card, I understand that, but it's been a week since we checked out and the money has not been returned yet.;4
Worn looking. Not aware that several floors are used as dormitories prior to booking, so there were many students. Random furnishings. Could not fully pull out desk chair because it hit the bed. TV was not fully functional, reported this twice. Problem was never corrected.;1
Hotel positives:  - location  - comfy bed  -fresh linen and towels daily  -decent size double room  -air con good  -safe   Negatives:  - the hotel is majority student accommodation so the lifts are a nightmare so busy and loud noise  -busy lifts  - shower boiling or freezing no in between  -really old decor  -broken plug on bath  -300 dollar deposit for 7 day stay;3
Room 2260: Everything was dirty and moldy in the bathroom! There we’re large stains on the carpet and on the chair. Absolutely disgusting!!    Facility fee: what was it for?! No one at the Front Desk could explain. They just said: „every guest has to pay it.“ No information at all about that before arriving at the hotel (reservation via Booking.com). We feel screwed!!  We asked for a Baby crib weeks before arriving - no answer at all! It seemed we‘ve been lucky that there was one available upon our arrival. Front Desk Staff tricked us with strange facility fee. Housekeeping staff seemed not to be operating at all. The whole floor in the room was a dirty mess.  Definitely will NOT recommend this place. Fraud with facility fee and totally overpriced for dirty room and lousy staff.;1
Arriving at10.45 pm after flying in from London, I was feeling a but tired and apprehensive ....Amazing foyer area in this Art Deco Hotel. Staff were friendly, my check in was a breeze, done in a matter of minutes and straight up to my room.  Spotlessly clean room which wasn't overly large but it was all I needed for a trip to NYC, as I intended to be out and about not cooped up. large bed, wardrobe, chest of drawers, bedside tables, safe, bath and shower, decent mirror, plenty of towels and constant hot water. The fittings may have been the original but worked well. A/C but no kettle or fridge, I coped!! The chamber maids were around every day and always spoke, lobby staff friendly and helpful only issue here was at busy times there are not enough lifts for 950+ rooms. The;4
Family of 4 (2 adults & 2 children – 14 & 8yo). Just back from spending a week at the New Yorker Hotel, end of May/start of June. After reading a few of these reviews on Tripadvisor, we were unsure what to expect at this hotel. Fortunately, we had a great week here, and loved the vibe/location of the New Yorker. Check-in was very quick and we were in our room within 15minutes of arriving (approx. 3pm). I asked for an upgrade and managed to get a room with a great view towards Hudson Yards on the 25th floor. The room was very spacious, which was a great surprise after reading many reviews saying that the rooms were small. We had 2 windows, and plenty room for all of our suitcases to be left on the floor and still have loads of space left. The air-con worked really well,;4
As a Wyndham Rewards member I appreciated being able to check in at 2pm on a Saturday and the 2pm late out. I also really appreciated the upgrade to a corner suite on the second highest floor of the hotel. Great views. The only minor issue is the the beds are a little small as is the bathroom.;5
Great location, great view for us of the Empire State Building & Madison Square Gardens.  An interesting historical building with a clean room and restaurant options on site.  Would choose to stay again.;5
An amazing hotel and stay. Warm welcome at reception  A lovely historic hotel with a great museum in the  basement next to the gym. The room was on a high floor and the view was amazing. Bed comfortable, tea/coffee facilities and a bathroom with a bath. Loved the position as near Penn Station in Garment District. Perfect for subway.  Can’t wait to go back and more than recommend. Tim Tok diner is wonderful for breakfast.  The team at the hotel are so friendly  Thank you;5
This hotel is in the perfect location for everything this great city has to offer. It is right by Penn railway station and its accompanying subway stations meaning we could arrive directlybytrainfrom Newarke Airport and travel everywhere we wanted to go by subway, including a visit to the Mets baseball out in Queens. Security is first class with keys checked before lifts could be accessed. The Italian restaurant and tik took diner both on site and both good, if expensive. Lots of other options nearby if on a budget. Our room was fine, if a little small, and the bathroom could do with a face lift. However this would not prevent us staying here again next time we are lucky enough to visit NYC;4
I had stayed here previously with my Husband in 2010 so knew the location was ideal and was happy to return this time with my daughters. We took the train from Newark, only 30 minutes and Penn Station is literally just across the road from the Hotel, very simple, straightforward and a bargain at $13! We had requested a high room so was a little disappointed to be allocated the 20th floor but went up with an open mind. I knew the rooms were small but we had paid for a Metro view and this room only had a tiny window looking down at McDonalds. I went back down to reception and expressed our disappointment, especially as the trip was to celebrate my daughter’s 30th Birthdays. They allocated us a different room straight away, we just had to wait for it to be cleaned. What a result!;4
At Nishat hotels me and my husband had an absolute pleasure of staying at this hotel! The front desk services were excellent and the room services were excellent as well! We would also add how fantastic and clean the rooms were. We would definitely be recommending our family and friends for a stay at nishat and we will also be visiting very soon In Sha Allah! We would thank Saima & Imrana;5
Stayed in a double room on the 22nd floor - honestly it’s like stepping back in time! View was non existent couldn’t even see the kind of weather or how to dress appropriately for the day! Didn’t mind the room been compact and it was clean but honestly in need of the biggest makeover, carpet so worn, decor so dingy and window is tapped up with black tape! It was clean with fresh towels but lord god invest in it as a result I wouldn’t return! Staff were nice and security at lifts was excellent! Could be such an amazing hotel if money was invested in it!  I find this very disappointing personally!  Good location for sightseeing however the streets leading off from it or so polluted with drug users it’s hard to believe!;2
So on arrival the hotel looks quite grand. Don't be fooled. The hotel rooms are on floors 19-40. Floors 1-18 is student accommodation. The hotel is very run down and tired. Very old fashioned and constantly smells of weed.  The rooms are not very nice, very old and feel dirty. The bathrooms are quite disgusting and you can't open any windows. There is no tea or coffee facilities,no drinking water and no fridge.  The hotel has an Italian restaurant which is lovely and an American diner which is fairly average.  The location of this hotel was the main issue for us. 34th Street has got a massive drug and homeless problem. Everywhere you turn, every street corner or shop doorway there is someone rolling a joint, injecting drugs into themselves or being sick. I have never experienced;2
Got upgraded to a suite due to being a diamond member. helpful staff, room was big enough, good powerful shower, daily housekeeping, great location, good security downstairs (required us to show keycards to enter hotel part of the New Yorker). Good experience overall, thanks!;5
The hotel is located in the busiest part of Manhattan. Very noisy and unsafe. The pictures from the hotel are not what you see at the hotel. The lobby has almost no furniture and the rooms are a lot tinier than the pictures. The hallways are very very old. The carpets are ripped and smelly. The bathroom is super old and rusty. The front desk staff was the rudest people ever. Very unhelpful with even the simplest of questions such as direction or suggestion. The location is very unsafe specially at night. There was a person stabbed right outside of the hotel when we stayed there.;1
We were in nyc for 1 night before going back home to north Carolina by train, we had a awesome 1 bedroom suite, that my 6yr old loved,40th fl great views right across from penn station comfortable beds,love the tick dinner,tip ask for Sandra the operator she is the best also great front desk Agents;5
My stay at the New Yorker once again was a great experience. Professional front desk persons were very cordial and accommodating to my early arrival. Sidewalk staff were dressed appropriately and eager to assist with area directions. Screening security wore smiles will checking room keys for access to the elevators. My room was just right. Overall, I felt safe, welcomed and will make this my next place to stay when I return to Manhattan.;5
Firstly I am giving 1 star as I cannot give zero! We stayed here as nothing else in an ok location was available. We stayed here in 2009 and the decor has not been refurbished so the hotel now looks even more tired than 13 years ago! I do not know how this is rated as a 4 star hotel? I have stayed in 3 star hotels in NYC far better than this hotel and the fact we stay in 5 star hotels around the world including the USA (Las Vegas) this hotel is a million miles behind them! I do not trust the 5 stars reviews on this hotel as genuine either that or the people leaving them have never stayed in any hotel before! You will also notice the hotel only comments on the good reviews! Right from the start this hotel experience was awful! Starting with the rude check in staff who tutted at;1
Me and my friend stayed at the hotel from the 23 of April to the 2 of may! Upon arrival I was informed that they would withdraw 300$ as a deposit and it would be returned upon checkout.  First of all the bathroom was super small and old, 2 persons couldn’t fit in there… The night before checkout our “bill” was stuffed under our door… odd way to do it. When we checked out I asked the receptionist when me deposit would be released. He said that the hotel would release as soon as we left the hotel and that it was up to my bank when I would receive it again. However almost a month later I have not received my deposit and they have withdrawn further 40$ without notice.. I have tried several email, Facebook and phone numbers however I have not received answers! Super frustrating and I;2
We had a great stay, staff were nice, location was great. However, the best part of our stay was the housekeeping. They paid so much attention to detail, even arranging my contact lenses! Our room was always spotless.   Our least favourite part was the tick tock diner, I’m afraid. Food was not great, male servers very abrupt. However there was one nice lady. Overall our stay was great though. Thankyou again!;5
*Centrally located and  a good base when visiting NYC * Staff were friendly and efficient *Security staff in the lobby which is good given the issues evident in NYC since cannabis was legalised.  *Room was sufficient. Badly needs an update. Stains on carpets and headboard.  Bathroom door chipped quite badly ,paint work needs freshening up in room and throughout the hotel.  *Compared to European standards this is not a 4*star hotel. At best it's  3*.  *I would recommend this hotel as its centrally located and sufficient if youre not in your room all day. If you want a little luxury look elsewhere.;3
Arrived at The New Yorker Hotel and I am very disappointed so far.  Staff at front desk, not exactly welcoming or even helpful, a touch rude to be honest.   Once arrived told we have to pay an extra fee for the honour of using the WiFi, phone calls and gym, none of which we need but not optional.  I wouldn't class this hotel as spotless in anyway, it's quite dated, shabby to say the least in many areas and as for the room, Queen with a view, don't bother.  No coffee machine, no fridge unless you want to pay an extra 65 dollars a day.   Let's see how the rest of the week  goes.;3
We were very disappointed with our room.  It was not clean with moldy brown spots in the bathroom and dirty marks on the walls.  The room generally looked pretty shabby and the hallways were dark and dated.  We were treated rudely at check-in.  The neighborhood is dirty and noisy.  The only advantage this hotel has is that it is convenient to the train station and subway.  Look for somewhere nicer in NY to stay!;1
It's a good and relaxing place to stay and I made all my business customer feel the best views ever, you guys should come and check it out and see for yourself 📉📈📊. Fully protected and the food is amazing 😍;3
Cons:  A little old and definitely a little tired.  Rooms are small and there’s no minibar.    Pros: Reasonably priced for NYC.  Clean, excellent service, excellent location for us taking the Amtrak and arriving at Penn Station.  Rooms are small but serviceable, and there’s certainly enough room.   Bottom line is the next time I come back on the train, I’ll stay here again.;3
Great location close to everything. Walk to Macy’s, Town Square, the Empire State Building. We had a room with two beds, two dressers, two chairs, and 2 closets which made it very convenient. The only complaint was the small bathroom.  Great security, very clean, and helpful staff. They have 3 eating options, and a gym.;4
This was my fourth time staying at the New Yorker. I just can’t fault it in any way. From the moment you arrive the front desk staff greet you with warmth, professionalism and always have service with a smile. We stayed in a Queen Terraced Suite which we upgraded to on arrival. The room was spacious enough, extremely clean and the mini fridge was a bonus. The view was the most amazing part of this room. When I was awakened at 3am with jet lag to step on the terrace and see the night sky line took my breath away. Throughout our stay our room was cleaned every day to the highest of standards.  Perfectly located in midtown for all the tourist attractions.  Could not have wanted anything else out of a hotel. Will come back to this hotel time and time again! Thank you for a wonderful;5
Stunning deco hotel, spotlessly clean and very good, central location. Most attractions walking distance (Times Square round the corner) and any that weren’t the subway was a minute away. We had a view of the Empire State and room surprising quiet. Staff very friendly. Would definitely stay again;5
I love that the rooms still have a 1930's feel about them. We had 2 queen beds and a big thrill was to open what I thought was a closet door only to discover a 2nd full bathroom. I felt like we hit the jackpot. Where do you get a decently sized room with 2 bathrooms in NYC?  I guess we lucked out as only a few rooms have these. I think during renovations they made 2 small ensuite rooms into one. I'd give them 5/5 if they had a coffee maker in the room. There is a Starbucks and MacDonalds across the street but I like having my morning coffee immediately upon rising, while in pajamas. I'd definitely come back!;4
Room was poorly equipped: no refrigerator, no coffee maker or hot water access. Towels rod falls with a touch. Water temp. in the shower is hard to adjust and inconsistent. Staff is cold to requests. Fee of $100 is charged without warning for ever not needed things.;1
We stayed for 5 nights at this lovely hotel. Our room was small, but clean and with a comfy bed and pillows as well as a good size bathroom. The room was cleaned every day and the location is excellent for sightseeing. As we literally only slept in the hotel the room size didn’t bother us as we spent all the days and evenings clocking up thousands of steps lol. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful and I would definitely recommend.;5
I’ve now been to this hotel twice and I love it! Yes it’s a little tired in places but it’s clean, steeped in history and in a great location. The beds are super comfy, the showers are hot and powerful and the Tick Tock diner is a must-huge portions, quick service and tasty food. Also if you head down the escalator from the reception you’re transported back to its heyday with lots of memorabilia about the hotel and it’s history.;4
Paid $2400 for a room with a view for 7 nights and although I got a nice view the room was not clean and it was old. Dust everywhere, filthy towels and dated room. And only one small window 1 meter. It felt like a dungeon. Small room, not big enough for a family of four. Beds are almost singles (130-140).  Half of elevators not working so it takes around 15 min to get down to lobby in the morning.   Cons -not fresh room -small beds (those are not double beds, the size was 140cm)  -not fresh bathroom and super small. Hardly fit 1 person inside. The toilet is next to the door and the door opens inside. -shady area, unfortunately the area has a lot of junkies, homeless and mental ill people. Not recommended for families. -the elevator sounded all night (our room was next to it);2
Truth be told I had a great time, right up until I checked out when I received a bill that included a US$29 per day 'facilities charge'. I queried it because relative to my daily room rate it was an extra 15% per day, which is not insignificant. Apparently this 'facilities charge' was for the use of wifi and the gym - whether I actually used it or not. It's not the amount involved that I am concerned over, it is that by deliberately not including this 'facilities charge' upfront in the published room rate I believe to be false advertising. While I did have a lovely stay at this hotel, this experience made me depart with a bad taste in the mouth and unlikely to return.;3
Our room welcomed us with meticulous cleanliness and pristine bedspreads! Denise did an exceptional job in making sure our accommodations were pleasing. She even checked in to see our happy faces. The only disappointment was reporting that our a/c did not work and it was ignored. Our room temp was a stagnant 77-78 degrees. Extremely uncomfortable with no compensation.;3
Would I stay again? Yes. Location great. Room ? Well if u are used to 5 star then no but comfortable and clean yes , water so hot though and bath fills real quick!!  The road noise is loud but amazing at same time. 5$ to store bag upon check out although 12 pm check out so that’s a bonus! .  We walked everywhere. Amazing central location. We did 9 11, Empire State , Central Park, high line, Brooklyn bridge, Times Square , Hudson yards all on foot !we did do a private transfer 90 dollars with no hassle to hotel. Text them for a return trip. Tick tock diner was fab. Drinks are average 8$ a beer and 12 $ a wine or cocktail. We found Irish bars have happy hour 5 a$ a drink . Lucy’s across from hotel does happy hour 4-7 . Macys 6-7 min walk . We walked about 27,000 steps a day but we;4
Excellent check in , small but spotless room , 1st class location ,  comfortable bed & room cleaned everyday  For me personally I would have liked coffee making facilities but it's not a deal breaker . $5 per bag to store luggage on leaving , quick & painless checkout  😁😁;5
We could see the New Yorker when we came up on the street from the subway. Perfect location. The lobby had all the flavor of NYC – buzz and excitement. Snacks, drinks, coffee, full breakfast and dinner were readily available without leaving the hotel in case of inclement weather. The 1930s bathtub and plentiful hot water afforded me delicious soaks after each arduous day. Love this hotel.;5
This hotel is a big hotel but treats its many clients as if its a small establishment, very friendly. The location for us was great. If you are on a budget or need a coffee or a bite to eat a McDonalds is right opposite. Just round the corner from Penn Station, which was wonderful for connecting with metro or trains etc.;5
Good location just across the street from Penn Station. Old hotell with a lot of style. Room was very big and clean. Staff friendly and helpful. Not cheap but good value for your money for being in NYC.  A good thing was that the elevators was in 2 groups. Floors 1-20 in one group and the 20-40 in the other. 3 restaurants in house. Only used the Tick Tock which is a real american diner with a big selection of meals and different kind of drinks. Food was good and big portions. Price was similar to all diners in the vicinity. Short walks to Hudson Yards or Times Square. Sudway just outside.;5
The best part about this hotel is the location, it’s close to all the shops, not far from the likes of the Empire State Building and has easy access to the subway. Our room was small and a little dated but it didn’t bother us. The bed was very comfy and the hairdryer provided was very good also! Having the Tick Tock diner in the lobby was ideal and I would definitely recommend visiting there. The doorman Frankie was very helpful with organising taxis to the airport and the employees at left luggage were also very friendly.   A couple of negatives unfortunately. The first being the check in process, the woman wasn’t friendly at all and acted like we were a huge inconvenience. Also, you have to pay to leave luggage at the hotel when you have checked out. We left 2 suitcases and 2;4
In my opinion best hotel in New York City. Iconic and central and staff so friendly and professional, from Lovely Linda at front desk to cleaning staff everything was fabulous   Will definitely return next time I’m in city;5
We came early to see if our bags could be held while we explored the city. Mohammed went above and beyond!  He got us our room (a suite!) hours early and then gave our room a call once we got upstairs to make sure everything was to our liking. It is great!;5
I just wanted to say a big thank you to Mohammed at the front office for being so gracious. So far, I have stayed at this hotel twice, and both times, Mohammed made sure our stay was comfortable.  The location of the New Yorker Hotel is central to many of the city's key area.;5
We stayed here for 4 nights in February and it was a great hotel! The staff were all really friendly, the hotel was always really clean and our room was always lovely and clean.  The room was basic but everything we needed and the bathroom was nice the shower had good pressure.  When we come back to New York we will definitely stay again but ask for a room with a view. Our room you could just see another wall of the hotel from the window. Didn’t ruin the holiday or anything though we didn’t spend much time in the room.  All in all a great stay! The location is amazing so close to Times Square and the Empire State;5
We booked this hotel for its location. However, they pretty much stuck us in a closet. Our room is so small that we only got an office chair and not another chair. The shower drips. No counter space in the bathroom nor anywhere else. The furniture is old and the handles are loose. Couldn’t sleep very week as the walls are thin and I could hear everything happening outside. I even thought people were trying to open our room door. I’m literally still here and I hate it. I’m having to sit at the end of the bed to even charge my phone and write this review as they don’t have outlets close to the bed. Paid the $33+ dollars for Resort/Facilities fee per night for absolutely nothing. Don’t even have a coffee maker in our room, let alone a fridge. Just read that if you want one it’s $50;2
Three of us went to NYC for a long weekend and had a Metro View room. Initially, the room given to us had a view though not entirely what we had been hoping for, but the hotel was very full that night. They offered to move us to another room for the 2nd through 4th nights and held our luggage for us while we enjoyed the city. Our new room was fantastic. I could lay in bed and see the Empire State Building! The room was spotless. The beds were very comfortable and our room was a very comfortable size, especially for NYC. We interacted with many of the staff during our stay and they were all so friendly and accommodating. We ate in two of the restaurants and the food was very good. The location is terrific with easy access to the subway, LIRR or Amtrak and also within walking;5
"Gorgeous views, beautiful decor and a safe location in a central area convenient to all of Manhattan. Just a block from Penn Station, this is the perfect hotel for those arriving by train.  Walking distance from Times Square, Broadway, Central Park, the Empire State Building, Macy's, Greenwich Village, and Hudson Yards; I had no need to spend extra money on a Taxi or Uber my entire trip. A doorman is on hand to help with luggage and assist with valet parking or hailing a cab for those who have transportation needs within the city.  Hotel security checked room keys for everyone going to the elevator lobby, and front desk staff was attentive and professional. The retro art-deco theme is interesting and fun. The attached restaurants weren't great, with mediocre and overpriced food";5
All around great stay. At check-in I was offered an upgrade that was well worth the extra $40/night. The room was beautiful and large, including a separate bedroom and sitting area. Amenity upgrades included a Kuerig coffee maker and mini fridge. I was on the top floor with an incredible view. This was an upgrade from my original reservation for a metro view queen room. I read some reviews that indicated long waits for the elevator but I never encountered this. All staff was friendly and professional and as a Midwestern woman travelling alone I especially appreciated the security throughout the lobby and elevator area. In addition, the location was perfect for Amtrak arrival and the on-site restaurants were good and very convenient.  Highly recommend.;5
Really nice stay. Cannot complain about anything. Be charming and the staff will be warm back for you.  Mohammed really made the stay fin for my kids. O asked of he might give us a higher floor on check-in. He said we had only paid for a regular room. I said ok no problem and smiled. Then Mohammed gave us a super room with a view anyway. What a dude.;5
We stayed 8 nights here in April . Nice and close to Times Square and a few other sights ! Great hotel , great staff … great stay. We will use this hotel again. Built in 1929, and one of the iconic buildings in New York. Takes you back in time as you enter the foyer … lovely atmosphere , highly recommended deserves  ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️;5
Great to see a concert at MSG. Lots of places to eat and shopping nearby. No fridge in room only downside. Very strict security code hat monitors the door. Three restaurants on site that were very good;4
Great stay at this hotel the rooms are a bit dated but very clean as is the whole hotel. There are some seating areas in the lobby and there is security in the hotel . The hotel is across the road from Maddison square gardens and only a few minutes walk to the Empire State Building and Macy’s  Would definitely visit again;4
This is our go to hotel when visiting NYC! Right across from Madison Square Garden and next to the Moynihan Train station it’s super convenient. Not to mention that it’s only a 10 minute or so walk to Times Square and numerous other attractions. The rooms are on the small side but are clean. We love the history of this hotel as well. It’s an older hotel but they are in the process of upgrading rooms and we love the look!;5
Arrived after a horrendous experience with immigration at JFK ,4 hours in a queue to get through,had room on the 19th floor looking down to 35th Street ,room very small ( expected for NY) and very dated,bathroom also tired,no storage,toilet flush very loud,talking about noise it honestly sounded like the window was open the amount of outside noise you got in the room from car horns and sirens.one last gripe was the bag storage,we had a late flight and had to store our bags,were charged $5 a bag,I have NEVER been charged at a hotel before and we travel regularly,a final insult !! On the plus side and why it got a 3,location good ,next to Penn station ,Hudson yard and time Square a short walk,staff nice and maid did a good job. On last observation on new York as a whole was the;3
Absolutely love this hotel we stayed for 5 nights .We arrived late after a bit of a stressful journey but the gentleman that checked us in was very welcoming I think he was from morrocco. The doorman Hector was so helpful and friendly.Lovely rooms perfect location  would highly recommend. All staff very friendly and helpful .;5
It’s 0130 and I have been awake for ages with very noisy people in rooms around us.  The night before awake with smell of cannabis at 4am from an other nearby room.  Bathrooms so noisy that a flush echos in other rooms. Windows don’t shield the outside street noise. I’m not a light sleeper usually but not a decent sleep here in 5 nights.  Corridors very dingy, lifts can be slow but maid showed us the service lift location.  The rooms are very small - I have never seen double rooms so small and very dated. Please consider this when booking. Safe did not work in either room as we had 2 rooms  Beds comfortable, showers powerful. Ice machine on floor 25 which was good.  Staff pleasant and no issues at all.  Tick-tock breakfast great.  I wouldn’t return to this hotel but the position;3
Stayed here for 4 nights at the start of April 22. The hotel is an iconic building in NYC, being one of the oldest hotels in the city it is a little dated with its brown decor. The room was large and clean and being on a high floor we had great views over the Hudson river. Our main reason for being in NYC was to watch some sport. This made the location of the hotel perfect for Madison Square Garden. All staff at the hotel were polite and helpful when needed.;4
We've always had a hard time finding a hotel with character when staying downtown. A lot of places just seem plain and small and squeezed in between other buildings. Not this place. The large lobby and details that only a place this old would have made it a great stay. And our room was a small suite with a balcony that had great views of the Empire State Building and MSG which worked perfect for us and our daughter.  The only complaint I could have was that the elevators were slow. But we were on vacation so we were fine.  Everyone there was very friendly and accommodating, and you couldn't beat the location. We found the place to stay in NYC and will return.;5
We were here in mid-April and stayed in a family suite - there were 3 of us. It was a good size room for NYC although the bathroom is quite small. There were two closets - you really only need one and the bathroom could have been expanded. The room was quiet and we had no problem with the elevators and there is security checking that everyone going on the elevators has a hotel key. Check-in went quickly and there is a baggage check for $5 per bag which I think most hotels in NYC charge. The hotel had the Tick Tock diner attached and that is convenient for breakfast, but get there before 9 AM otherwise there may be a line. Service is OK but they seem a bit understaffed. Location is great. We arrived at Moynihan/Penn Station on the train & it's just a 1 block walk to the hotel and;5
Arrival was very smooth, the lobby was quiet round 13:00 so check in was very fast and we had wonderful service from Mohammed who provided us a room on a high floor for city views and complimentary early check in as the room was available.   The room itself had everything we required although being a New York property it was small in size and very dated but the bed was very comfortable and we had a nice view across Manhattan.   We didn't use any of the hotel facilities but were aware there was a gym in the basement of the hotel.   The only downside is being charged the service fee for using the property that I don't agree with and to make things worse on top of this the hotel also charge $5 per item of luggage for storage until heading to the airport later that day, this is a;5
This was my first time ever in New York. I went to celebrate my birthday and wanted to stay close to my bus drop off location and the New Yorker was one of the hotels that popped up. I thought the location was fantastic and everything for the most part was within walking distance. The hotel history appealed to me greatly as well. My stay was beyond amazing and would very much do it again in the future.;5
The New Yorker hotel is large and beautiful. The rooms are big and have everything you could need. The best part are the views of NYC, they take your breath away. There are a lot of elevators to use and they are fast. The Housekeepers were pleasant and cleaned the room every day. My favorite hotel in NYC!;5
We stayed here for 4 nights at the start of April 2022.  All of the staff we spoke to were very friendly and helpful.  The room was a bit small for 3 people sharing, there was very little space to unpack or even lay out our suitcases.  The diner on the ground floor is good and the fitness suite has reasonable facilities.  It was really easy to walk to all of the main attractions in New York and is also close to a subway station.   Advice for buying souvenirs like hoodies, buy on a weekday, it’s much cheaper.   Would stay again!;4
I stayed here a couple of weeks ago, knowing that it was a dated hotel in a not-so-glamorous part of town.  I’ve stayed in many hotels in NYC, from the Ritz Carlton to Hampton Inn.  I found this hotel to be quite desirable for my needs.  First of all, it was close to Penn Station, and I always go to NYC from Baltimore by train.  Also, when I did use Uber, my rides were not that expensive.  My room was small, but I’m alone and don’t need a large room.  I have a lovely apt. in Baltimore to come home to, so this room was clean and the service was great.  I’d high,y recommend this reasonably priced hotel.;4
We were here for a 4 night city break from the UK, the initial overall impression is of Art Deco in brown which we liked. Our check in was pleasant and efficient, our lovely receptionist Lily was excellent and offered us several upgrade options - we chose to upgrade to a junior suite on the 23rd floor. Our suite was really nice, decorated in keeping with the hotel’s origins and with a city view of Madison Square Garden. The elevators were mostly fine, we rarely had to wait long. The hotel has 24 hour security in the lobby, which I found reassuring. Our room was very clean and had housekeeping daily (not all hotels have this at the current time, apparently). A really pleasant visit.;5
Our experience at the New Yorker was ok. The price was good for Manhattan. Great location right next to Penn station. Elevators were a bit slow but not terrible. The pressure of the water at the 20th floor was so strong and the water so hot that after walking all day it was wonderful to be able to take a bath.;4
My family have just returned from a 6 day trip to New York. The rooms were nice and clean and staff were extremely friendly. Highly recommend this hotel as its location was brilliant especially for MSG.;5
Quiet, clean, and comfortable rooms coupled with the very best customer service in the biz, make this my favorite hotel to stay at when I am in New York City. The pricing is fair and reasonable also. The staff went out of their way to make me feel welcome and valued.;5
Just back from a 5 night stay with my family to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday. Our room was lovely, brilliant views. Very clean too. Our daughters room was On the same floor but at the other end of hotel, they didn’t have a view and room was smaller. Definitely get a room with a view if possible. Staff friendly and security is very good. Hotel is in a fantastic location. We only visited TikTok diner on first morning… the older guy in there was very grumpy so we didn’t go again. . So many amazing breakfast places close by we went somewhere different each day. As I Travel  Agent I would recommend The New Yorker to my clients.;4
"I have just got back from a weeks stay at The New Yorker. When I arrived it was at the end of a very stressful journey. At the check in desk I was told they didn't have any trace of my reservation. It was the last thing I wanted to hear and I was on the verge of a meltdown. Samira M was absolutely fantastic. ""Don't worry Sir I'll soon have this sorted out"". Five minutes later I was checked in and on my way to my room. I had been worried about the trip after reading some of the negative reviews. First off You're staying in a piece of history. I thought the hotel room and other areas were really nice. My room was a decent size and very clean. I really enjoyed my stay and I would stay again.";5
PERFECT HOTEL ♥️friendly receptionist huge warm room  Nice view well clean and decorated ,Lightings is good ,PRETTY GIOD HOTEL LOVELY STAFF FOOD IS GOOD LOTS OF GOOD DRINKS TO BE choose.we’ll recommend for a couple trip .wifi is. Pretty good 😊 perfect for everyone;3
Stayed at the New Yorker for a week in March, very very impressed, location is fantastic, a short walk to Macy’s, Times Square, madison square garden, penn station to name but a few.  Staff were always very friendly and I liked the fact there was security guards on the lifts so you literally couldn’t gain access without a key card, also the room was cleaned to a high standard every morning without fail. The check in was really quick and easy to do, and a $300 hold on my debit card for incidentals. I booked with virgin so all my fees were included such as internet and resort fees, the Wi-Fi was reliable and easy to set up, also had access to the fitness centre if needed. We upgraded to a metro view room for $30 per night and paid $30 for a fridge in the room which was perfect for;5
Hotel is very central - easy to walk to most places and very close to the subway. Decor is dated, however, my room was clean and had everything I needed.  The check in and check out process can be quite time consuming depending on how busy they are, but in general, the staff are really helpful.;4
This Hotel is literally a short walk across the street from Penn Station..Off the train from Boston and minutes to our room.. Literally minutes from Times Square,St  Pats Cathedral to namer a few. Numerous restaurants in the area as well..;5
So, this is a real landmark built in 1903. Beautiful architecture and Art Deco. Our room was tiny and the bathroom just large enough for one person. The plumbing and everything is old, but the bathroom and rooms were really clean. The beds were comfortable. We had our own dedicated heater and air-conditioning and it worked well. The best part was the TikTok diner right in the hotel. They have the best drinks which are worth the price and the food is good without being totally over priced. There is 24 hour security who checks everyone before they enter the elevators. We did feel really safe here. The location is great with direct access to several subways and walking distance to Times Square and Broadway. This is a bargain hotel. Compared to the other prices in the city you get;3
We stayed here for three nights while in NY for a Billy Joel concert at Madison Square Garden. The property needs updating, but our room was comfortable, the staff was excellent, the price was reasonable, and security was great (always someone on duty checking room keys before you could get into the elevator).  This hotel was built in the 1930s and a good deal of the charm remains.  The location can't be beat, kitty-corner from MSG/Penn Station and within walking distance of Times Square, Empire State building and, if you're game, Rockefeller Center. Lots of decent restaurants and bars nearby.  Check out the bar in the basement, occupying a space once used by a bank. You can even get a table in the vault! The service there was excellent, as with check-in, cleaning staff, etc.;4
Went to NYC to see Billy Joel at The Garden which is just across the street from the hotel. Location is actually pretty good..Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are across the street (Penn station subway entrance is next to the hotel). Short walk or taxi ride to midtown, Times Square, Lower Manhatten (9-11 memorial, Freedom tower, Battery Park etc). The hotel staff is wonderful, service was just a call away. Unfortunately we were not offered Bell service even though we took a cab there from LGA.  In fact we didn't know they had it until we checked out and asked if someine could get our bags. The hotel is outdated and requires upgrades. Needs nee carpet, paint, beds, etc. There was no coffee maker or fridge in the room but housekeeping did bring us one when we asked. Closet;3
I booked the hotel through Amtrak rewards and got a very good price the hotel itself is classic New York architecture from the 20s 30s great location right across the street from Madison Square Garden in Penn Station blocks away from Empire State Building only a few blocks from Times Square everything in the room work which is most it hasn't 24/7 Diner to Tik Tok which I use all the time and has two smaller restaurants I want Italian in one steak house in the facility which are much more expensive than the tiktok;4
Recently stayed at this hotel, location and facilities were excellent. Rooms were very clean. Service Agent Mohammed was very helpful during our stay and was very attentive. I would definitely recommend this hotel;5
Just returned home from New York and had a brilliant time, the hotel was in a great location making it easy to get to the main attractions. Our stay was made extra special by guest service agent Mohammed who went above and beyond to make our stay here special. The room was clean and and the beds were really Comfy.;5
Our recent trip to this hotel was made special by Mohammed guest service agent.  He was extremely helpful and went over and above to assist us.  Our room was very clean and although some review said lift waiting time could be long we didn’t wait more than 5 mins at any time. I would highly recommend this hotel for location, facilities and cleanliness. Would definitely return;5
Just back from New York last week and stayed in New Yorker,well we had a fantastic time,place lovely and staff very friendly especially miss Henry head of security as our safe was broke and she came next day to fix it,she also advised us things to do and .she is such a lovely person .the tick tick diner is great plenty of food choices,again staff friendly and helpful nothing a problem for them.will definitely be back and will stay there in your hotel again made plenty of memories;5
stay in this property for 4 nights. it is an old hotel so room is very small good enough for overnight sleep. if you think you need to spend lots time in the room then I will not recommend this hotel.  location is great next to Penn Station subway. Many restaurants within walking distance. one 24/7 restaurant is in the hotel property convenience for breakfast . McDonald and Starbucks just across the street.   Time square is 15 minutes walk. By the way, my room have a prefect view of Empire State Building .;4
Obviously a little dated but but location is excellent was able to walk everywhere. Really enjoyed the history of the building , room was very clean and as some other reviews have highlighted windows were a bit drafty but the heating was fine Would certainly use this hotel again;4
I’ve just come home from a stay at the New Yorker and can highly recommend.   The location is perfect. Just on 8th and 34th so beside Penn station train and subway station so access to all part of New York is really easy.    The room we booked had 2 double beds and was so spacious. As soon as we entered we could smell how clean it was and the housekeeping was brilliant every day.  Not all rooms will have an amazing view of course but ours did. We could see the edge and the Hudson.   Lobby staff check for room keys before allowing anyone to pass by the main entrance so safety of guests is well considered.   All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.   Had a 24 hour diner attached which is a huge bonus.   All things considered, we loved it !;5
Small rooms, with 1950s style showers and leaking windows, no hotel would decently rent rooms that have ‘natural’ air conditioned rooms with windows that leak in every room , and a heating system that can not overpower the cold air leaking intothe room.  This is truly horrible place to stay at. The bedding is so outdated and incomfortable. The bed linens and duvet are so thin, thanks to the natural leakage of every window, you just almost freeze for your entire stay duration at the new yoker Hotel. The fridge in the room is very noisy,  The air conditioning unit is working full time to try to prevent the room temp from falling below 40F at night with the wind blowing through the windows.  The hotel management is incapable of providing extra bedding or a stand alone heater unit.;1
After reading many mixed reviews I was a little apprehensive on arrival.   On arrival we were advised that our two rooms had been upgraded due to my mums 60th birthday. The view was brilliant. We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. The room was clean. A normal sized room for a NYC hotel room.  Our rooms were cleaned daily and we always had fresh towels.  There is a restaurant called Tik Tok in the same building. This is great for breakfast or a late night snack.  My only con with the hotel was that there were no hot drink facilities within the room. If you want a kettle there is a $25 a day charge. There is a Starbucks right opposite the hotel that is cheaper each day.  The hotel is within easy reach of time square a stones throw from Maddison square garden.  I;4
Had a wonderful time Hotel is very centrally located. Friendly staff great rooms. Really enjoyed the history lessons down by fitness center. Bed was comfortable really like the balcony view. Bathroom was very clean.;5
My home away from home, centrally located easy accessible to subways, Madison Square Gardens, Times Square, one block from the famous Macy’s. Your safety is their priority no one get in without a room key.;5
Saw online reviews, thought it would be nice, so booked a stay for 6 nights.   Was put into a room which was so small, and worse than a 1-star motel and everything in the rooms is 20 years old.   Reasons for checking out of the hotel - Hotel is Dirty  Hallways are filthy and smell of smoke Rooms are cramped up and too small and no where same as pictured  Everything is old and musty.  My wifes allergies started to act up.  Feels as if we were scammed as we were showed great pictures and hotel was too shabby. No coffee machine  Couldnt spend any more time there and immediately checked out next morning on 29th Jan.   I talked to the hotel manager and we were not offered any other room and were told you booked the cheapest room in our hotel, so this is what you get.  Politely asked;1
Extremely well located hotel very close to Penn Station. We only used metro twice. Once for 911 memorial and other time for Brooklyn Bridge. Other than that everything was within walking distance. Staff at front desk very helpful. Rooms perfectly adequate and clean. Views over the city amazing. Beds so comfortable. thank you New Yorker;4
"This Hotel is in a perfect location.The History behind this Hotel is facinating. I didn't know all the celebrities who have stayed there. My favorite team the NY Yankees stayed there in the 40's. Nicolai Tesla had a suite there for 10 years and passed away there. There is a great diner downstairs , ""The Tic Tock"". I would definetly stay there again.";4
I stayed at the the hotel overall the stay was good wa surpised there was drink making factiles in the room or bottle water. On arrival I was informed that I needed to leave $300 (£230) deposit which I was not made aware of before hand however I was not in position to argue the toss and was informed it was a refundable deposit. I thought this would be return on departure I checked out two weeks ago and still no sign of the deposit being return. It concerns me that they have not returned it. I was a solo traveler who left the room as I found it.;2
The hotel is old and large, and I appreciate the fact that I couldn't hear any noises elsewhere in the hotel.   It's the staff that really up-tic this hotel from good to exceptional.  I was on my last nerve when we checked in and there was an issue with the cc used to pay for the room which was quickly resolved but the front desk worker was kind enough to upgrade our reservation and provide us with a room that had a balcony larger than my living room at home -- absolute stunning views and breath of tranquility.  The housekeeping staff -- whom we never saw -- were magical.  Our room was positively spotless each day.  They were wonderful!  And the doorman was friendly and confident of finding transportation for us in drenching weather.  So while the actual hotel itself was nice,;5
We reserved a queen suite & asked for early check in.  When we arrived our room wasn’t ready yet but we were offered another suite on the 40th floor with amazing views.  It was $75 for early check in but worth it.  The hotel is older but still well kept.  Housekeeping was great & security checked to make sure everyone had their key card which made us feel safe.  The elevators can be slow but this is a historic hotel built in 1930 that still has lots of charm.  We could walk everywhere & the subway was close.  Tik Tok restaurant was great for breakfast.  I would recommend if you want to stay central at a good price.;5
Fabulous location! So close to Times Square and broadway. Subway right next door. The housekeeping staff were fantastic too. Room was clean and Wi-Fi was excellent. It was very good value for money. Would definitely stay there again and would recommend.;5
We have just retuned from a New York break, 5 nights staying at the New Yorker hotel on 8th Avenue. This is advertised as a 4-star hotel, which it is not, I’ve stayed at better 2-star hotels. It’s really tired and shabby with tape covering the frayed edges of carpet in the communal areas.  If you are staying on 21st floor and above you may wait up to 20 minutes for an elevator as they are not always working. The windows in the rooms do not fit the frame so the wind howls like a gale through the windows, making the rooms extremely cold. We had to keep the curtains closed the whole time to stop the freezing draft.  The receptionists are not very helpful, when we arrived, we explained that we had paid for bed and breakfast and were advised by the receptionist that breakfast was;2
Arrived on 13/02/22 for 6 nights and was a fantastic hotel and overall experience in NYC.  Was treated to an upgrade to a suite on 23rd floor which was perfect and gave us plenty of room and extra sofa bed in living area.   Staff were all really friendly and courteous.   Great stay and hope to be back;5
Stayed here for 5 nights over Feb half term as a group of 4.  We had 2 double double rooms booked which were on the 23rd floor and next door to each other which was handy.  I'd read a few reviews that said the rooms were on the small side and yes they were but who needs a massive room when all your doing is using it as a base and to sleep in.   Both rooms had 2 double beds, a desk, TV, drawers and a cupboard with safe & iron/board.  Bathrooms were a good size with a shower over the bath. Good water pressure and temperature considering the size & age of the hotel. Simple toiletries such as shampoo/soap etc provided and replaced when needed. Housekeeping came around each day also, replacing towels if required and making beds, emptying bins etc. Super friendly and chatty too.   The;5
Loved the New Yorker. Friendly helpful staff. Beautiful clean room. Everything was great. Wish we could have stayed longer.  We were only there for one night to attend a concert. The value was excellent. We were even upgraded. Will definitely stay again. Terrific location.;5
We had a fantastic weekend break in this ideally located hotel. The staff was fantastic and always enthusiastic and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel because of its ideal location, friendly helpful staff and great value.;5
Really enjoyed our stay here. The rooms were small but clean. But bedding nice and good pillows made up for that. Bathroom small but good enough for the time you spend in there. Downside there is no consiege which I thought was strange for such a big hotel. Reception staff quite helpful though.  Would definitely stay here again because of the location. Penn station just over the road. Not far from Time Square, Empire State and Macy's.  All in all a good stay.;4
Everything ok!   Excellent location, very close to Macy’s, Times Square.    Subway station is on the corner, you can take the bus Across the street.  And very important: front desk staff so friendly!    Absolutely I’ll return to New Yorker Hotel.;5
Had a great stay. The location was perfect, everything was in walking distance. Hotel was very clean and we felt very safe in and around the hotel. We loved looking out the window and seeing the Empire State Building.;5
Staff were all very helpful. Room was very clean. The interior of the hotel was nice. Liked the little extras like the Bumble and Bumble toiletries in the room. Great location. Right next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. The area was very busy around the hotel so maybe not ideal for every visitor. We were a little cold one night and staff provided an extra blanket promptly.;4
Lovely Art Deco hotel in the perfect position to explore NY we walked to most places which were v close. These included Empire State Building which is visible from the hotel. Times Square, Central Park, The high line & Chelsea, little island,Staten island ferry, Brooklyn bridge. Loved it Perfect positioning as said and the little dinner “Tick Tock” connecting to the hotel was perfect;5
This is my 4th visit to New York but first time in this hotel, In a good location, Just a few things put me off to a point I won’t be returning. We were being checked in by Mohammed who asked us to leave him a review, then said he’d waived all the fees of an early check and room with a view (we didn’t ask for either) he must have asked us to leave him a review about 7/8 times. We then got into our room with the phone ringing - its Mohammed reminding us to leave him a review (No joke!) it’s not want you want or need after a 12hr travel day. The rooms are quite small but considering you’re only sleeping in them it’s not a big deal however they do need a deep clean. The curtains/nets were covered in thick dust and fluff. The lifts are very slow so make sure you don’t need to rush;2
Visited 3 years ago and upgraded before arrival to one of the newer rooms and wanted to do the same when we return in September as I've booked with virgin and they don't offer the upgrades but advised I could do this directly but I can't get in touch with the hotel - I live in the UK so can't call and none of the email addresses I find online, I get a response to. We're travelling for a celebration so I'll be gutted if we can't get a better room as I know the unrefirbished rooms are tired and disappointing so really hoping the hotel can respond to this with a way to help me upgrade for September!   The group Wyndham email response just told me to phone the hotel and when I explained I couldn't in my second email it went ignored so I feel like this is the only want to go to get a;3
Pros:  - Close to Penn Station - Close to Subway which will take you direct to WTC in one direction and Natural History Museum in other direction - Comfortable room albeit quite small - Hairdryer/Safe Provided  - Good view of Empire State Building  Cons: - Outdated furniture/bathroom  - Water takes ages to drain in Shower, your feet end up dirty! - No Coffee facilities (this alone drops it down a whole star for me, such a simple change) - No Room Service etc - No bottled water provided in room - Location feels unsafe, see below.  Overall, an adequate stay. We were here 4 nights. I think if you’re just stopping in NYC this place would do you fine but for slightly longer trips I found myself wanting a little bit more. Just basic stuff that is missing such as coffee making;3
My husband and I used to live in NYC and we now travel back frequently for my medical check-ups. For the past 2 visits, we stayed at the New Yorker. It's a  beautiful old hotel, rich in history, relatively low in price and conveniently located next door to Penn Station. There are 3 restaurants in the hotel , a fact that we greatly appreciated this last visit, when the temperature dropped to the teens and we didn't want to go outside. The best part of the hotel is the staff- everyone from the doormen to the front desk to the housekeeping staff are friendly, respectful and responsive.;5
Hotel Location Is Excelent, Just At A Metro Exit. Staff Is Very Kind And Efficient. The Room Furniture Should Be Upgraded. Hotel Restaurants Are Very Different From Each Other, From The Expensive One To A Regular Price In Other.;4
We stayed in the New Yorker over Christmas. Our room was extremely dated as was the rest of the hotel. We expected a small room but perhaps not as small as we got. We couldn’t even open our suitcases on the floor.   I aren’t sure if the rooms get nicer as you go up but we were first given a room on the 19th floor but before we went up we asked if there was any any lower down. We were given one on the 13th floor. If this is the case, it would have been nice for the receptionist to say yes there is but the room isn’t the same quality.  The staff who stood at the bottom of the lifts to ensure that you could only get in with a room key never said hello\good morning.   The location of the hotel is perfect for seeing the sights of New York.;2
Great hotel right in the middle of New York City - what more could you ask for. Cant wait to come back for next visit.  Tick Tock Diner next door is a must for breakfast and really sets you up for the day.  Room was spacious and the bath was HUGE and a fantastic way to ease the aching legs after exploring this amazing city.;5
The hotel and staff are amazing. The building is just beautifully preserved in 1920's art decor and the staff are polite,helpful and appreciative.  All amenities were close buy, walking to Macy and Time Square is quick and easy.;5
Pros: the hotel is well located in front of the penn station/MSq garden.The lobby is fine and the front desk people are attentive. The gym was ok. Cons: to get down from the 34th floor, you’ll have to wait for the lift 5-10 min. The room is clean but VERY small. Good view of Manhattan and the empire state from my room.;3
We were allocated this Hotel as a part of our group package and it appeared to be a good deal as the daily fee they charge to use the fitness centre and have free telephone and wi-fi was waivered. The location is superb right where you want to be to explore wonderful NYC, close to subway, manhatten, empire state building etc. First impressions are good also, as the foyer, bar and reception are all art-deco clean tidy and the staff are very engaging, polite and helpful. The tick tock 24 hour diner attached to the Hotel serves great food and the eggs benedict is out of this world. 10/10 thus far. Our booking stated we was in a standard queen room and when we arrived reception informed us that we had been allocated a room without a view and he would upgrade us to a room with a view;2
Overall I enjoyed my experience but the ending soured it for me.    Being told it’s $15 to leave my bags downstairs for half an hour while I ran an errand before going to airport ruined my experience.  The cheap comes out expensive.    I would have been happy to til the attendant $5 but paying $15 is insulting to me as a guest who stayed here for 3 nights.and needed to leave my bags for 30 minutes.    Been travelling for a long time.  Never was extorted money to leave my bags for a short period of time.   Not cool.  At all.  Bad form.  Bad customer service.  The baggage attendant wasn’t exactly nice.  And the hotel clerk didn’t seem one iota interested in my plight. Or in helping me.;1
This hotel was recommended to us by Virgin holidays. First impressions were okay, although I was worried about the area the hotel is located in.   I was staying here with my teenage children and had booked 2 rooms, when checking in we were given rooms 5 floors apart which wasn't ideal.  I have seen a lot of reviews about the lifts, however we didn't have a problem with this and only waited a short time, if at all.  The ticktock diner is very good, reasonably priced and so convenient.   Our rooms, located on the 21st and 26th floors, were small (even though they were both double, double rooms) and dated. The walls are paper thin and we could hear the people next door singing in the shower and using the toilet.   Overall outlook stay was satisfactory, but  we would not stay here;3
This hotel worked great for our family. The diner downstairs was really good and affordable. There is also a bar which was nice for the adults. You can see the Empire State Building from some of the rooms so request a view. McDonald's and Starbucks was across the street which is nice for a quick breakfast.  We did end up taking 10 min taxi rides to most of the sights. Was a little far for small kids to walk. The staff is super nice. Muhammad at check in is very helpful.;5
So disappointed .....New York has  been on my bucket list for year's....room was teeny tiny,our view was of windows directly opposite us😔 Tiles in bathroom dirty...lifts an absolute nightmare...waiting for ages. Staff so-so,the doormen outside we're the most friendly and helpful.Would not return;3
Very nice and famous hotel in the vicinity of the Time Square Manhattan. Great view from 34 flour to US Empire State Building NYC. Kind and professional staff. Nice commodity and atmosphere. See you friends!;5
We visited over a 4-day period to get in a short vacation. We chose the hotel because it was a classic hotel with character and history. The hotel is a bit older but had all the things that we were looking for. We had a minor issue with the room keys and the staff resolved the problem by upgrading our room to one with a view.  It is within walking distance or a subway ride to about anywhere in the city. The staff was very friendly and helpful and provided anything we needed. The wifi was surprisingly fast and that satisfied the younger members of the family.  If I were booking a stay in NYC again, I would choose this same hotel.;4
We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It has a great location. Room was very clean a spacious. Only downside were that beds are not doubles , so if your sharing you won't get much room!  We enjoyed visiting Tick Tock Diner next door.;4
A very nice place, I recommend it to everyone with children and married couples.great prices and views. Very good location, and the hotel staff very nice and helpful. Food delicious, my opinion is 5/5;5
As all reviews state this hotel is in the best location. I guess it comes down to you get what you pay for. We stayed 5 nights over New Year on the 21st floor and although we’d requested a high floor with a view, we didn’t get one. It was booked months in advance for a bargain price & if we’d paid the prices they were charging at the time, we’d have been very disappointed. It’s definitely a budget hotel. It’s great if you don’t worry about the size or decor of the room.  The decor is old and dated (especially in the drab corridors) & the bathroom was tiny and old, but always clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful & Sean the security guard was especially friendly and interesting to talk to.;4
Originally booked NYC for April 2020 to visit family but obviously with Covid it’s taken until now to get there & when the opportunity to travel at Christmas came up we jumped at the chance! This wasn’t the hotel we originally booked but it turned out to be better than our first choice. Location is brilliant, slap bang in mid town, opposite Madison Square Garden so easy walking distance to Times Square, Empire State is 5 minutes away and the High Line & Hudsons Yard 10 minutes. We also walked the 25 minutes to Central Park which is a straight route from the hotel……this was our second visit to NYC so did know our way around a little. Penn Station is 2 minutes away and the subway is fairly easy to navigate. Our rooms were a little on the small side and a bit dated but for the;4
Horrible experience at the New Yorker.   We had to charge one of our phones in the bathroom, not to mention the fire hazard plug socket behind the bed!!   Room was tiny, our luggage took up most of it! We couldn’t move around much in the bathroom at all. Room was very dated and dirty (marks on the headboard which was very off putting!) - the walls were so thin all we heard was walking about in the hallway all night, alongside our neighbours being noisy…. VERY thin walls!!!! Awful night sleep.   We got there about 11pm at night due to a late flight, stayed one night and left a day before we were due to because of the sheer state of our room. Hotel reception were very poor and not very helpful or sympathetic at all.   Currently speaking with our agent we booked this through to;1
We stayed from 23 to 28 December on the 20th floor in a standard queen. Check in was quick, staff were friendly and welcoming ( offered upgrade options but didn't take it).  The room was as expected clean tidy and enough space for us and our cases. The rooms were cleaned daily, room service available and always staff on front desk. Security always asked for room key before accessing the lifts.  Location great Penn Station on the doorstep ( main Subway line) and to our surprise madison sq garden opposite hotel entrance (see photo).  Would recommend hotel, good value, great location and lovely staff.;5
Stayed for 10 nights in December 2021.  Paid for a room upgrade, and was not disappointed!  Large room with two very comfortable double beds, one each for me and my daughter.  Oh and the pillows were the best! We also had the added bonus of a view of The Empire State Building.  Room was spotlessly clean, thanks to housekeeping staff, all who were genuinely nice people, as were all the staff we dealt with. Tik Tok diner was also a bonus, again the staff were really lovely.   Location is excellent for navigating around the city. Close enough to walk to a number of locations, and close to Penn Station/ other subway stations I’ve been to NYC a number   of times, though this was my first time staying at The New Yorker.   I wouldn’t hesitate in staying here again.;5
Have been back for the 4th time now and will prob be my go to when visiting. Love how it’s situated especially and the diner is a big plus!  The rooms are a bit old but clean and everything works, beds are good and shower is lovely;5
Great 24-hour room service and everything is Truly one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed. Staff is so nice and you never wait around everything is ready to go.. great experience. Amazing Great Thank you for your five-star review, we hope to welcome you back again soon!;5
The New Yorker provides convenient access to dining, theater, and affordable parking at Penn Station (only a block away). Professional and personable hotel staff. Comfy beds, clean room! Will be back!;5
We had our Xmas dream granted when we got to visit nyc at Xmas time,we stayed in the newyorker hotel which met all our expectations, fantastic location.great staff,nice rooms which were big enough and very clean 2182 was our room,very close to macys.the edge etc really could not fault in 1 bit,will definitely stay here the next visit we do;5
Never stayed up this end before, but it’s a great location, penn station, madison square garden, Macy’s, right on the doorstep!   The hotel is lovely! Lovely reception staff, great concierge , lobby staff, happy to help, friendly and knowledgeable.  We had our room cleaned every day, she was brilliant! Tho we did take the majority of our rubbish away with us! Love the recycling bin in the bedroom!   Would I stay here again? Absolutely!!  Hope to see you again very soon 🇺🇸🗽🎄❤️;5
I took my 36 year old daughter & her 3 children 12,8&4 to NYC to experience the childhood I had with my mom who recently passed. We stayed in a suite at The New Yorker & it was amazing. I will try &  make that my yearly ritual.;5
This was the experience of a lifetime,  the staff are amazing from the saluting greeter to the concierge who couldn't do enough to help,  right next to maddison Square gardens and a stroll from time Square and central park.pefect Holiday had by all the family 👪;5
Eveything was in order.  I did notice in other reviews complains about waiting time for the elevators, but i had no issues and waiting time normal.  The room was also nice and warm.  Great access to subway just around the corner and Macys 4 minutes walk away. Would stay again.;5
The New Yorker is located in a brilliant location with easy access to the subway and main attractions. The staff were really friendly and did as much as they could to ensure we were comfortable during in our stay. Our room was cleaned to a high standard every day and we would definitely recommend this to friends and go back ourselves! Thank you for a brilliant stay :);4
After booking last minute then reading reviews we were nervous - however... Friendly helpful staff - particularly helpful when we were struggling to get covid tests results back to fly home. Everywhere was clean. We never waited more than a couple of minutes for the lifts. OK so the rooms are a bit basic and tired but it's the oldest hotel in new york- there's history here!! And seriously do you come to New York to stay in your room!!?? The location is perfect for a tourist visit.  We would definitely stay again and recommend;4
Bathroom uncleaned. Toilets.... Can't even describe. Nails on the floor.  Filthy. Don't go!!! No help whatsoever from front desk. Had to check out early morning. No news since. No to mention Covid times.;1
…Nice… ….Excellent Location… ….Coffee machine at lobby doesn’t work… …staff helpful… …needed to pay to luggage keep…. … nice view from room… … windows doesn’t open… … windows not very isolated………………..;5
A little disappointed if I’m honest , I know it’s an Art Deco hotel and from 1929 , the lobby looks fantastic , when u move to the lifts they look worn and old , everywhere look freshly painted but over the top of old paint , it all just looks well .. old and not in a good way ,  The room is 2 small for 2 beds and the beds are not double beds , we were only here 2 nights so I let it go , but I will be talking to our travel agent who booked it;3
All that was good about the hotel is the location. Constant waiting for elevators, no personal attention (well I understand a huge hotel), really small room. I have been to many other hotels with the same room type, but I have never been to such a small one. Room cleanliness is sufficient, but for two people one vial of shampoo and soap? A restaurant adjacent to the place, did not give priority to hotel guests, also brought in from the street as a regular. Luggage storage at extra charge also for hotel guests, it has always been part of the hotel's service, but probably not here. I chose this hotel because it is part of the history of New York but unfortunately did not live up to my expectations;3
This was our 10th time staying at this hotel and it was Great again, Location is fab, room was spacious, Very clean, Great free wifi, Diner and restaurant on site were Great also, Highly recommended and will be back next year, Covid  tent straight across from hotel which was great.;5
We booked for our daughter's 18th for a 4 night stay leading up to Christmas at the New Yorker. Unfortunately the room our daughter and relative were staying in was a queen double but it was late and we were tired. We had asked for a good room for our daughter and relative. The next morning Mohamed helped us out despite being fully booked he moved our daughter and relative to a twin room and as it was a different floor my husband and I also moved and to be honest to a nicer larger room. The hotel is nearly 100 years old and as it's cold outside quite draughty around the windows. It is a stunning hotel excellent location! Very helpful accommodating staff. Thank you Mo for helping us. 😊😊😊;4
This is a great place to stay and very conveniently located.  There is a subway station right next to the hotel and is walking distance to practically everything including Madison Square Garden, Times Square, Empire State Building, the new High Line Park, Rockefeller Center to name a few, and there are plenty of places to eat nearby.  There is a bakery just down the block called Angelina's which is FANTASTIC, a CVS next door, plus a liquor store, McDonalds and Starbucks across the street.   The Tik Tok Diner in the hotel is a great place to eat.  The hotel retains its original character and it's well worth the time to go downstairs and read all about it's history and the people who have stayed there.  It is a great value! We have stayed here twice now, once just overnight on our;4
It was a bit noisy. There was a lot of noise mainly from the workers rather than the guests. The room was simple, clean, and neat but difficult to rest with the high noise level despite putting on the do not disturb sign.;4
The hotel is well located just steps away from Penn station and a few blocks from Time Square !! friendly staff and clean rooms. that's all I need when it comes to a place I want to stay !! Also just 5 blocks away from the Edge;4
It is an older hotel so do not expect anything else. Rooms are small but clean and functional. We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. Prices are very reasonable. Centrally located to Penn Station and the subway to every other attraction. The staff were friendly and very helpful. There are several restaurants attached to the hotel. We tried the Tick Tock diner. The food was very tasty and again service was exceptional. This is an older hotel. Rooms are going to be smaller, and somewhat outdated. The rooms are clean,  staff is friendly and helpful, prices are very reasonable, and it is centrally located. We enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again.;4
You can't beat the location here. You are one street away from Penn Station. Times Square is a ten minute walk away. Unfortunately the hotel seems run-down and in need of a major renovation. It just looks worn out (worn carpets, cracked tiling, creaky elevators). Speaking of the elevators even though there were supposed to be six of them it only seemed like a few were working. Be prepared for long waits and once you do get one it will be packed with people stopping at every floor. The room itself was incredibly tiny. If you are with someone I hope you are very close. The bathroom is tiny as well. The sink has no vanity and really no space to put your toiletries out. They also nickle and dime you for stuff here. To check your bag at the bell desk is $5 per bag..I gave it three;3
I stayed in a Queen room with a view and the room was reasonably sized however quite dated and the bathroom had aged and needed some attention.   Half way through the holiday I turned on the bath tub tap and brown water was coming out of it. I called reception and his response was to let it run for fifteen minutes and see what happens. Throughout the holiday the water was not totally clear but was not as bad as it was when it first happened. However I felt that the staff member was not approachable to solve the matter.   The maids were very good throughout the stay. And every staff member on our floor (29) would say morning to you and have a good day which was nice.   The elevators are very very very slow!! You could be waiting up to five minutes in reception and then when in;3
The New Yorker is the best ! Located in the center of everything, complete with comfortable beds and great high-pressure shower in Art Deco bathtubs (love my baths)…  and the views are spectacular. There is a 24-hour NYC diner attached to the property called TICK TOCK which is great! There is an Italian restaurant also attached -also very good.. and in the basement below the TICK TOCK?: a kicka$$ steak restaurant called the BUTCHER AND THE BANKER, which is fan-tastic !!! It is located in the marble and wrought iron gorgeousness of a former 1930’s BANK. People are literally eating in a beautiful VAULT! A vault the likes of which Al Capone and Rockefeller could have hid massive slabs of gold. That thing is huge!  The flagship MACY’S is so close-by, too— loved that— They have a;5
Booked the hotel in may 2021 and since then I have emailed the hotel 11 times to not get a response. From the moment we checked in it as been a nightmare.the rooms are very small,dirty,out dated and extremely uncomfortable,the staff are very abrupt and rude and have zero customer service skills,the lifts are an absolute joke where was waiting on average 20 mins for one to arrive and only 3 out of the 6 are working I have stayed in NYC many times at many hotels of all different ratings but this is by far the worst I have ever encountered I would not recommend or return here and if you have any sense you will book elsewhere,they may give you a good price online but that will change when you arrive and to be honest if they was to pay me €300 a night I still wouldn’t stay never in;1
We stayed here for the weekend with our family. I know when we booked it months ago and the rate was fairly cheap for December in NYC that it would not be great but I was even more disappointed than I was expecting.  The rooms were small and dirty.  The bathroom was not clean, rust in the tub and dirty. Our toilet got clogged the 2nd night and took an hour to get someone up to fix it.  On the last day we had a charge to the restaurant downstairs that  was not ours.  We got the run around trying to get it reimbursed.  The hotel management would not take responsibility for it and told us to find the managers of the restaurant and they did not help us.  We had to leave for the airport before they could resolve it and I am sure we won’t get it back. Very disappointing!  We will not;1
If you are staying here plan on leaving at least 15-20 minutes early for wherever you are going. There are only 3 functional elevators. Also if you need the hotel to hold your baggage while you wait to check-in or before departure they charge you 5$/bag.  The check-in/check-out process is very inefficient and the lines are very long with few hotel staff working. The room was tiny even for nyc standards but we did get a free fridge delivered to our room upon request. Overall would not recommend but location was convenient.;3
Convenient location: Right next to Madison SQ garden and a subway stop. Walk a little bit more and there’s Times Square! Nice view: I stayed on the 22nd floor and I was able to see The Empire State Building!  One night was a little under $170 (which is a steal for its location), but they allowed us to check in 2 hours earlier than the check in time so that was awesome 👍🏻;5
Not enough words in the review to explain my disappointment with this hotel so I have screenshot my Google review. Staff unfriendly, elevators an absolutely nightmare. 20 mins to wait for one as only 3 out of 6 or 7 were working. No signs to say some were not working and I was there for a full week. Had to take the staff elevator or take the stairs as there were no covid restrictions. Staff too bothered about showing your hotel card to get to the elevator then to be helpful of any kind. Tick tock diner was a nightmare in the end. Ignorant rude staff. I was thrown a check at me and told to pay at the counter which is absolutely not protocol. I always thought the people in the UK(as a UK resident)  were generally rude people but experiencing the new yorker, wow my opinion has;1
It continues to amaze me that The New Yorker, an aging hotel of days gone by of Nikola Tesla fame is still doing well in the city that doesn't sleep with so many other options for quality hotels. Well I can tell you that my recent stay was a very good one not being in the area for 2 plus years for a trade show. The location to many key sites is key. Only thing that was missed was complimentary water in the past at check-in. I would have given it 5 stars but the little things still mean the most!;4
My original hotel was closed so I had no choice and the booking agent sent myself and my aunt to The New Yorker at short notice. What I will say is this hotel is in a great location a very short walk to Macy’s, broadway and MSG, and the subway is directly outside the hotel. On entering the hotel it appeared very grand with lovely Art Deco design, but I was in for a shock. What is labelled 4 star on A website is no where near it, 4 star for location, there are plenty elevators but only one or two appeared to be working. Resulting in queues and cramming not ideal with covid restrictions. When we exited our floors the carpets were very worn and the corridors dark and not welcoming. I was initially several floors below my aunt and had to ask to be moved to same floor, which they did;3
We stayed at the New Yorker from the 28th November 2021.  Upon arrival we found the hotels position to be perfect. Across the street from Penn Station, opposite Madison Square Gardens and just a few minutes walk from Macys and The empire state.   The check in procedures are easy and simple, however with a hefty $300 holding charge.   When we reached our first room all I can say is how disappointed I was, having requested a to have an especially impressive room, the room was tired, poorly lit and decorated in a terrible shade of brown. There was one tiny window which offered a view onto a brick wall.   Back to reception, who could not be more helpful and into a new room 2926.  Immediately better, much bigger window, much more light and the view was incredible, straight onto the;3
"I was in NYC last week, at The New Yorker, A Wyndham Hotel. My credit card was asked for incidentals, which I had no intention of using the other hotel facilities it was fine. I was told the next day that a facility charge would come off my card, I had paid for this upfront via my travel agent, after speaking with two front desk staff it was confirmed that  no charge was made to the card. The issue was with the gentleman  at the front desk, he was dismissive and abrupt when I asked about this,  definately NOT good customer servise, he said on a few occations ""NEXT""  The room was generally clean but I did find hairs in the bath and sink which was disappointing. The cleaning staff were polite and  friendly. I stayed at the The New Yorker, A Wyndham Hotel previously and found it";3
Just leaving after a lovely 4 day stay.  4 adults beautiful hotel, very pleasant staff to welcome you,  upgraded us on arrival to a huge family room 2 bathrooms, beautiful clean, great maid service daily  Ideal for empire state building and times square.  Starbucks over the room and Mc donalds all on the door step.  My only comment would be $5 Per bag to leave your case on departure day also a $300 dollar security deposit for room.  We definitely will return thank you New Yorker;5
"When a hotel's in a great location, it's easy to overlook things like ridiculously slow elevators, room keys that consistently demagnetize (regardless of how close/far they were from my phone), dingy lighting and peeling paint, but cockroaches are a whole other story. I discovered two in my room -- on the 29th floor -- during my one night stay. Both were a healthy 2"", well beyond grabbing a piece of toilet paper and taking them out. I mentioned the cockroaches when I checked out and got a blank stare back from the receptionist, as if to say, ""Can I help you with anything else?""

Clearly, that's lost on everyone I encountered but for one housekeeper who wished me a";1
Checking in was easy and quick. But while the room was tidy, there was a empty juice can in the bin, old make up and it was obvious the bath hasn’t been used in awhile with dust and dirt round the edges. On the second night I discovered I was to be charged an administrative fee of £40 that I was unaware of, after insisting I didn’t owe them this for two days they eventually removed it from my account. The other staff were polite and friendly. Biggest bug bearer was the lifts, once I had to wait 15 mins to get a lift, they were always full, no social distance!!! On my last day the lift stopped altogether and had to go down the stairs, I was on the 29th. Its ideally situated to most sights and the subway.;4
The hotel is conveniently located near to rail station. The hotel rooms were clean and our suite roomy. The service was great, with all staff polite and helpful. A grand hotel done in Art Deco. We will return.;5
Hotel is good for a weekend/short break with an excellent TicToc Diner next door.   The hotel is a very good location adjacent to Penn Station, a link to New Jersey Transit/Long Island Railroad/Subway and access to JFK/Newark airports inaddition to the subway to all parts of Manhattan.;4
"We booked a twin room but subsequently the New Yorker said ""No-Can-Do"" two days prior to arrival. It is only fair that I post this review prior to our arrival on 6th December 2021 so as to give the hotel a fair chance to rectify and enable me to ammend this review";1
The Hotel was lovely and the Staff extremely helpful , we felt very safe with the security staff doing a excellent job. The room was small but adequate and clean and bed was very comfortable.   Would definitely return but would upgrade to a slightly bigger room with a view. Thanks for making our trip enjoyable 😊 the location was amazing too.;5
I stayed at the New Yorker twice, once in July and once more recently in November. Both times I booked a Metro view room with two double beds and could not have been more pleased! The rooms were extremely spacious with large, well-lit bathrooms. More importantly, they came through with the promise of a view. The Empire State building loomed outside of our very large windows!! I love the vintage feel of the building and the spectacular Art Deco lobby. I also appreciated that on both visits they allowed an early check-in. The only cons are that it is a very large hotel and lines to get service at the front desk can be quite long at peak times. I also really wish they had coffee makers in the room. The proximity to Penn Station makes this a really great option for folks coming into;5
Check in was awesome -  Mohammed took really good care to see that we got the best room with a wonderful view.  And he really delivered !!   Accomodations and the hotel restaurant were 5-star !!!  I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again !!!;5
Spent a week at this hotel and was really disappointed so much so one of the first things I did was to email the manager but not even had an acknowledgment from her.  I also completed the online survey early yesterday.     Anyway, here is my honest review.  We arrived early, as our original flights had been cancelled, when I say early it was a maximum of two hours earlier than we would have got our rooms.   I had asked for two rooms together via email before we left the Uk and was told they would try and arrange it.  We arrived only to find nothing had been done about my request.  The receptionist informed me we could have one room but would have to pay $25 plus taxes to have it two hours earlier.  After a very long 24 hours I agreed.   He then managed to swap this room with;1
Where do I start , I see a lot of good reviews but frankly speaking I think you need glasses ! This is the first hotel in the world I have ever checked out of immediately after arriving with my wife from Uk .Prior to arriving I had emailed on several occasions ahead to try upgrade and place something special in the room for my wife’s birthday! No reply to any email at all . Night before we flew I eventually managed to get through on the phone to someone who was apparently working from home and helped with a room upgrade to sweat / balcony etc . A credit card was given to secure the upgrade and a email confirmation. The email was wrong as stated 1 person and a total value of over $2,700 for 4 nights . I had already paid fir a standard room but charged this for a upgrade! We;1
We stayed here for the weekend of Anime Con NYC.  I was a bit concerned as this is an older hotel. I can say we were all pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed our stay. We were a group of 5. Two moms and 3 teen girls that were attending Anime NYC. From the minute we checked in to the minute we left we had a pleasant experience. Check in was smooth. We asked for a rollaway because we had a group of 5. We needed one of the larger rooms to accommodate the rollaway. Our room was not ready yet so they took my number and said they would call when ready. We checked our bags and off we went. Someone called a few hours later and told me the room was ready. We went up and our room was clean and comfortable. Our rollaway came right up. We called down and they brought our luggage up.;4
The New Yorker Hotel was absolutely wonderful. We stayed here to participate in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and it was a perfect place to stay. Awesome charming room with views of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden. Comfortable beds, quiet, always felt safe and secure, great water pressure in shower. Close to everything. Highly recommend!;5
This was my first time staying at the New Yorker.  I took the train from Boston to NYC and the hotel is literally one block away from the station. The hotel is also close to the theaters and within easy walking distance of other sights.  The room was small but immaculate and the bed was comfortable.  I would stay there again.;5
We stayed overnight for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade as we are Parade Marshals who need to be up and out early.  Once again everything was excellent at the hotel, from reservations, front desk staff, cleanliness, security. We were very pleased again! We will continue to stay at the New Yorker Hotel whenever we need to stay overnight in NYC!;5
I have stayed at this hotel three or four times during the years I have been traveling to NYC. I am always very satisfied with service, cleanliness, attention to detail and ease of check- in and check-out. The staff is always attentive and tries to help in any way possible. As an extra perk, the location is only a block from Penn station. I recommend this hotel strongly!;5
My family of 4 booked a 2 queen family terrace suite. While the view from the terrace is stunning our actually family suite is 290 sq Ft while the description states varies between 420 and 460. The front desk knows they have to soften the blow of “yes we know but your view is the best” I know some of the reviews state that they have been given different rooms that are bigger so I know they have different size rooms available in the same room category. I get that this hotel is old but how about being honest. Biggest pet peeve of mine. Offer discounts for the smaller rooms. I paid a premium for this room for my family. My husband and sons birthday celebration on the nice room was a bust. We have 3 more nights of sleeping in this tiny room. Incredibly disappointed.   The lady that;1
The best place to stay in NYC!perfect location & geat professional staff ! Just a block away from Penn station and the garden! Easy walk to just about everything! You'll love this classic art deco gem . Make sure you visit the hotels free history museum below the front desk floor.;5
Most impressive was the check in process where Assistant Director, Michael, made me feel welcome and seen. The room overlooked the Empire State Building, so the mornings were spectacular light shows as the morning colors rose from the bottom of the Empire State Building. The sheets were like new, and the bed itself very comfortable.   GREAT customer service. Very special room in New York.;5
"I was here for a seminar, so I didn’t choose the hotel. Big pluses: comfortable rooms, deco design, pleasant and helpful staff. Negative: it’s an awful neighborhood and taxis are hard to get since people leaving Penn Station grab them first. The Tick Tock Diner claims to be the largest diner in NYC; it’s certainly the archetype.";3
So I'll start by saying the hotel has tons of potential, but it feels held back because of the price you pay for the location, the bathrooms are very cramped and noticed odd smells, the beds are way more firm than expected, and overall it was a good experience with everything except the actual room.;3
The hotel is conveniently located near Penn Station, it's less than a 5 minute walk. Mohamed offered excellent customer service and allowed us to do an early check in. Our room had a Beautiful view. The room was small but we just needed somewhere to shower and sleep after doing a day trip, room was clean and checkout was quick. I would highly recommend.;4
This is not a luxury hotel.  However, it is clean, the housekeeping staff is amazing, the beds are super comfortable, everything went smoothly throughout my stay.  Convenient to entertainment, great food, the subway.  I will stay here again.;5
This is a fantastic hotel. It’s so good that I reactivated my long-dormant TripAdvisor account to write a review. The staff was amazing: super nice, friendly, and helpful. I cannot say enough good things about every person we encountered. The room was great — huge (and this is New York!), comfortable, and most important, clean. Keep in mind this is a 100-year-old building so “clean” does not always mean “new,” but we felt very comfortable. They did a great job, especially given the pandemic. It’s worth checking out the small museum about the history of the hotel in the basement, or even just the Wikipedia page. Thank you to the fantastic people at The New Yorker. We’ll be back for sure!;5
The front desk is very kind and accommodating and I had a hassle free visit. I ended up needing to stay an additional night in NYC and staff quickly modified my reservation the day before with no issues. Also, the room was large for an NYC hotel room, which I appreciated. The room was also very clean! Thank you for the great stay I will certainly be back and will recommend this hotel to friends and family.;5
I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone!!! The hotel location is close to everything and the rooms are very clean and comfortable.  Plus, the staff are very friendly and accommodating. Our room have a balcony and the view was amazing!! They also have a restaurant in the hotel and the food are really good and affordable.;5
This is a fabulous Hotel so close to everything that is New York.  Thank you for a wonderful first time experience in New York.  The Restaurants attached to this Hotel are exceptional and the food is fantastic.  Hope to come back soon.;5
Yet another great stay at the historic New Yorker hotel in Midtown Manhattan!!   I've stayed many times before and am always pleased.  The hotel has great old New York charm and nostalgia, and the staff are amazing! I especially want to thank Mohammed at the front desk for making our stay especially memorable.   We arrived a little early and were very tired from travelling. He assured us he'd take care of us - and he did!  We requested a change from our original reservation, plus he upgraded us to a beautiful terrace suite. There's nothing better than being able to walk outside from your hotel room and enjoy the sights and sounds of New York.  Thank you, Mohammed!;5
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this famous piece of New York history. Being next to Penn Station, the fab Moynihan Hall, and Maddison Square Gardens, the location is hard to beat. Plus, it's only a few blocks from the High Line Park. It seems like the hotel rooms start on the 20th floor, good for being above the street noise if so.  We got upgraded (apparently it pays to be a ""Diamond"" member) to a fantastic two room suite, and it even had an outdoor terrace with stunning views. The room was clean, and the decor was newish and updated, but still appropriate for its historical art deco history.  The bed was comfortable, and our room was very quiet. We also enjoyed eating at two of the three eateries in the building. A great way to start our New York adventure.";5
Came as a family of 4. Big rooms. We had a great stay but especially liked Samira from the front desk who made our stay even more enjoyable helping us with what ever we needed. She was friendly, professional and did everything she can to help.;5
I absolutely lived this hotel, the room was very clean and all the staff were so friendly. I especially liked the restaurant who do the best steak I've ever tasted! If I ever get the opportunity to go to new York again I'll be stopping here.;5
The rude staff was awful. Nobody could even use a kind tone. They were short and spoke to adults as though they are children and nobody smiled. They could not be bothered. The place was dingy and the area wasn’t so much desirable. We won’t come back to this hotel.;1
We arrived a little early and they had a room ready for us to put our stuff in and we got to enjoy the city a lot more that day. The staff was super nice and knowledgeable , the rooms were clean and exactly what we needed. We will be staying again come next October .;5
Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a suite without even asking.  We had a corner room with an awesome view, sitting room w/extra bathroom and a patio.  That said, I cannot comment on a standard room.  The location is great as it is close to the train station and not too far from some major attractions i.e., times square, etc. without all the noise of staying in times square.  The hotel is old but we prefer old and quirky with a little history.  The cost per night was very reasonable compared to some other hotels.  There is a diner which is open 24 hours.   We were able to store our luggage for $5.00 ea. on the day of check-out since we had a late train.  The hotel is not  5-star but for the price, it was fine especially if you are out and about most of the time.;5
This hotel has a lot of pros and cons. Pros: great location, three restaurants, subway entrance next to building, next to Penn Station (train station), next to Madison Square Garden, amazing view of Empire State Building, in some rooms, nice water pressure, each unit has own air and heat control (amazing for 1000 plus room hotel), good security, 24 hour diner (pre pandemic), for New York, the rooms are a decent size. Room service was offered but only for the diner. There are some major cons though. The walls are paper thin. You can hear a lot of noise outside. This is an old building (historic) and can give a creepy vibe. Only two elevators were working out of the ten they have, and service elevators (there are six of them) were not offered to guests. Long lines to get to rooms.;3
I have been staying at the New Yorker Hotel for many years & it is my favorite by far in NYC.  When I go to the city I travel to other boroughs & areas outside of the city & being the hotel is one block from PENN Station you can get anywhere easily.  I come in by Amtrak from Denver get off the train & walk across the street to the hotel & when I leave I cross the street & take Amtrak to Newark Airport or another train from PENN station to one of the other airports. Among being the cheapest hotel in Midtown by far what makes this hotel so good among all the others are the people that work there. In the 10 hotels I have been to this year they are the only one that has full staffing & are offering all there services. It is the only hotel that offered daily housekeeping & room;5
If you’re booking this hotel through a third party such as Expedia/Priceline expect hidden fees to be added. I was told I had to pay $100 a night at check in on top of the amount I already paid. Very frustrating as I had bags and wasn’t easily able to switch hotels at that point. The rooms are small and outdated and unappealing. I ended up checking out early to move to another hotel.;1
This was the best location to visit and experience NYC. Most attractions are walking distance away. Subway station is right outside the hotel which makes it convenient to go almost everywhere. We were even able to catch the train to JFK airport without much effort. Staff is courteous and polite. Mr. Mohammed who helped us at the check-in desk helped us with early check-in and gave us a great room with a view on 25th floor facing the Empire state building. He also checked in with us to make sure we were satisfied with our room. Cleaning staff made sure we had clean, fresh towels and beds every night for our 4 night stay. Would totally come back to this hotel for our next NYC visit.;5
We stayed there for 4 nights. The location is wonderful. Very close to Penn station and lots of attractions. We had a basic room with 2 double beds. The only thing I did not like was there was no coffee pot or fridge in our room but we did know that when we booked the hotel. We were checked in by Mohamed who was very friendly, he got us an early check in and gave us a room with a view! This hotel worked great for our quick vacation.;5
"This hotel is completely legendary. Wonderful historical exhibit in the lower level showing posters for big bands, GIs during WWII, info on the mechanical and electrical systems. Lobby is fantastic. Great location. Very nice diner just off the lobby is great for bkfst. Bed and bedding are very comfortable. Security is excellent: you must show your room key in order to enter an elevator, Soundproofing f/ outside noise (sirens, honking horns, etc.) is very good. Wonderful, big bathtub. Room was small but I don't care. The place is very clean. However they nickel and dime you to death. $25 to to check in before 4pm. even if your rm is ready. $5 to hold onto your luggage before check-in. Most outrageous: $40 for ""facilities fee"" covers business center and fitness room whether you";3
This hotel is a perfect Location for me. I bring the bus in from Pennsylvania and it's only a less than 10 minute walk. The adjoining restaurant called the TickTock has fantastic breakfast. I prefer the eggs Benedict. The staff are extremely friendly and check in is very speedy. My room had two queen beds and two bathrooms which is perfect for a girls weekend;5
A stay at the New Yorker is not a cheap experience even with a booking site. It was clean but limited.  No in room fridge,and the room while clean is small with paper thin walls. Ideal for staying in NYC because of location. The staff is friendly and considerate which made the stay bearable. If you are looking for a centrally located space with limited amenities.  This is your place.;3
We stayed in a family terrace suite for one night.  We were supposed to stay longer, but I had called a week before to change the reservation.  The person I spoke to said the confirmation number was the same.  I should have called back to make sure everything was set.  We arrived on Friday night after driving around for 2 hours looking for parking (see below) and the man at check-in said they had expected me the night before and that since I was a no-show they had given my room away.  I was shocked, and told him that was not the case.  In the end, he found us a room and we were all set.  I wish I remembered his name, he was very kind.  The room itself was very nice.  The suite we were in was on the 35th floor.  There was an entryway, a huge walk-in closet, a bedroom with 2 beds,;4
We were there for 5 nights.  Food in the Tik Tok Diner was very good, quickly served and the wait staff were very attentive.  Close to Penn Station and subways.  Only problem was that the one shower didn’t have hot water.  We had two showers so I could use the other one.;4
The hotel has old world charm but the bathrooms could use a little updating. There is little to no counter space. I did appreciate having 2 beds. The staff at the hotel are great. We didn't require much but it was great to know they were able to assist when we needed them.;5
The hotel is more on the old side, but it's not bad at all. The security is so overrated. That they don't know the limit, but besides that, my stay was okay. The customer service is terrific. Everything gets taken care of very fast when you ask for something, so for that, I would come back when I need to be in that area!!;4
Positives: Fantastic location. The shower pressure is amazing considering we were on the 25th floor. Not a long wait for lifts. Hand gel/sanitiser at each floor. They even have a 'museum'/ 'memorabilia' collection in the basement for famous moments from the hotel's history but it is not really advertised.  Negatives: Definitely feels like a has-been hotel - we stayed in the room next to the one where Muhammad Ali stayed which was a pleasant surprise! But otherwise the hotel has definitely had its hay-day. The place is in need of a complete renovation - new paint/ carpet etc. Whats more we stayed during storm Henri and had water dripping from the celling/wall (see pictures). Told the front desk and they said someone would come and have a look, 10 minutes later front desk called;3
"The use of masks was not mandatory when I stayed there.  That was terrible. I always had my mask on, but not all guest did because no one at the hotel enforced that. As a matter of fact, the staff mentioned that wearing masks was optional. Plus, they never asked to see proof of guests vaccination.  I also had a surprise ""cleaning fee"" charged to my account and not a single answer, proof or evidence of what this was for.  My room was clean and I didn't leave any mess nor did anything inappropriate in my room,  so for me this was outrageous. I have traveled considerably in the U.S. and abroad and this is the first time that I have to deal with something unfair and unprofessional like this. When I tried to inquire about this, I only met rude staff.    I also had a key that stopped";1
I have to qualify my review to state that we were given a heavily discounted rate (I think it was $350 for 3 nights) if we agreed to sit through a Wyndham Time Share sales pitch. We sat yes.  We arrived at the hotel around 11 am and waited in line to check-in for over 30 minutes - a true inefficient front desk (only 3 customers in front of us, but we still had to wait 30 minutes). Not surprisingly our assigned room was not ready. No worries, can we store our bags and come back around check-in time of 4 pm? Sure - FOR $5/BAG!! That's right, luggage storage costs $5/bag. No tipping allowed, but at that rate, I would not have offered one anyhow. The desk clerk promised that they would call us as soon as our room was ready. Fair enough.  I will interject here that the New Yorker is;1
SERIOUSLY!!! The worst experience ever. I extremely recommend guests to never EVER book this hotel. I have checked out on Aug 21st and as of today September 10th I never got my deposit refund at all. It's impossible to call the hotel because no one EVER answers and Secondly I had to do an international call almost everyday from my end just to get in touch with Wyndham. When a guest arrives they want immediate payment for everything and when you checkout they'll charge you for whatever you did immediately and when you want your basic right i.e. Deposit refund back to your depit or credit card you'll never get that and you'll be sending tons of emails to the manager (which I got from the hotline number that I had search through google) and I'm only getting useless apologies. I'm;1
"The lobby is nice.  The elevators are slow.  The hallways to the room are dark and depressing.  The rooms are small.  They're ok, but are showing significant wear.  They charge a bogus facilities/resort fee that covers basically nothing; it's just a money grab because you are charged it whether you use the extremely limited facilities or not.  NOTE TO HOTEL: telephones are not a resort amenity.   Some of the front desk staff were rude like you'd expect of a stereotypical New Yorker on a TV show or movie.";2
I am so disappointed that this property charged to hold bags after our checkout and until our pickup for our departure from the city.  That $5 pushed me over the edge and I will be leaving negative reviews on Google and Trip Advisor.  I booked a queen view room.  There was no scenic view of NY as promised in your website. The view in 3340 was of the guests in the rooms across from us, we were in the armpit of the corner.  The room size is misrepresented in the pictures on the website, and the room was so cramped that i hit my knee on the heater every time i attempted to exit the bed and maneuver my way around the heat unit to the bathroom.   and of course, there were no amenities such as complimentary coffee in the room or lobby.  If i were staying for more than one night, i;3
The hotel seems ok to me: it is rather well located, close to times sq., many deli shops and right next to penn station and the moynihan train hall, just a small walk away from the 5th ave. and very close also to hudson yards and the high line. The lobby is good looking in a nyc art deco style. Once inside the elevators seem a bit old and not very well kept but they have many cars to serve the whole place. The floors look a bit odd with large aisles with no atmosphere. The rooms are rather small but good enough. They are simple with just a few spaces for stuff and a decent bathroom with a gas station-like wc but clean enough. (The shower had an amazing pressure I haven't seen before). They charge you for keeping your lugagge either at check in or check out but, with me, they;3
Beautiful New York hotel with great views from beautiful rooms. Already booked for this Christmas COVID depending of course   Close to Maddison Square Gardens and a few blocks from time square   Lovely food outlets just steps outside the hotel. Macy’s also just steps away.;5
For our trip, the location was key!  8 blocks to our daughter's place in Chelsea and 8 blocks from midtown.  The staff was friendly, and helpful with everything and anything we needed.  We requested an extra blanket and a few extra towels and the were at our room in a minute or two.  You will not feel more welcome anywhere else but home.;4
Right near Penn Station and MSG.  Well appointed room with 2 closets and 2 bathrooms, what a pleasant surprise.  Great staff with exceptional service.  Quiet, clean, and comfortable.  Check bags for the day.  And on-site restaurants and bars are reasonably priced.;5
Our receptionist Drisser went above and beyond to see that my son and I were completely satisfied with the room we eventually moved into.  He stood by his word to make our stay what we were expecting from the advertised choices, and went out of his way to see that the room details were conveyed to the staff there.;5
I stayed here during the Christmas Holidays, I know a little late to review but I really wanted to say what a great experience I had at the hotel. Check in was efficient and easy, the room wasn't quite ready so they stored our bags. I loved the history and character of the rooms and lobby and the hotel itself was in a fantastic location to explore Manhattan.;5
While i am writing this review in jfk, on the way home after ten great days there. The staff themselves are very kind and try to help as much as they can, I would like to point out Ronald the shift manager at night who took responsibility for a malfunction I had in the room and within minutes arranged another room for me. And an older and short cleaner with short hair who was super nice and sociable and unfortunately even though I asked for and was promised her name I did not get it. The hotel is close to everything 8 minutes walk from Time Square, 4 minutes from Madison Square Garden. In the 7 minute walk from the Fort Atori station in short close to everything. The e, a, c line is also close to the hotel within walking distance. The rooms are a bit outdated and the shower is;5
Nadia is the manager I’ve ever met for a hotel chain. She is very polite and well experienced. She makes people comfortable before they even arrive. I’m a retired postal worker and I can honestly say we need people like her in the post office. I been going to New York City for 15 years since I been away I always managed to book a one to 4 night stay their.  Not for the location but for manager and housekeeping very polite and friendly.;5
I appreciated the housekeeping staff who did a good job of cleaning the room and the people who make sure only hotel residents come in the elevators.  The business room was just what I needed and the gym was great!  The rooms are small but it seems that's what one should expect in downtown.  The rooms DO NOT have a fridge or microwave both of which would have been very nice.  At check-in I was charged an additional $40 resort fee on-top of the resort fee charged when I reserved the room.  Parking is $50 a night, there's a spot for 2-3cars to pull-over and unload before parking kitty-corner to the hotel.  There are lots of places to eat with-in walking distance and it's not a difficult walk to Times Square, the Empire State Building or the 9/11 site.  Possible changes: fans in;4
Smooth check in and out. Friendliest staff! Very satisfied with our 1 bedroom suite! Sweet! Perfect view of the Empire State! Will definitely come back. Easy access to the metro/ subway. Tick Tok diner perfect for late night munch and drinks.;5
The New Yorker is soon to turn 100 years old (2030), and it keeps the ambience (with modern amenities, of course) of the 1930's.  The rooms are nice, well kept, and functional overall.  The service is very good, with kind personnel striving to make you feel at home.  The location is perfect, just next tp Penn Station, where you can hop on on different subway trains and go practically anywhere in the city by Metro. There are, however, over 2,000 rooms in the hotel, and you have to be patient while waiting for the elevators.;5
In the morning time when me and my kids was sleeping I heard a noise, then I called to hotel staff so they can fix it, but nobody can do anything, and then after couple of hours later I one day early checkout , even they didn’t give me my money back, I was in hotel with my wife and kids and for us it’s terrible experience Thanku 🙏;1
If you would like a comfortable stay in a convenient location during your trip to NYC, look no further than the New Yorker. The Tick Tock diner that is in the Hotel lobby has decent food at a reasonable price.;5
EXCELLENT property, was very surprised.   Professional staff, loved the history of the hotel.  LOVED The New Yorker, and would easily come back!   Highly recommend this spot--great location for Penn Station and subway access.  Times Square is an easy walk.  Well done!;5
"Chose this location traveling as a solo mom with a newly adult daughter, neither of us having been to NYC before. Very easy to walk from Penn Station after train in from DC, easy access to subway system and walkable areas (like Empire State Building-5 min, Central Park-25 min, FOOD!!!!). After a flight cancelation, we chose to rebook a 2nd night simply because of it feeling safe/comfortable. We did have a very different experience in our 2nd room-much louder street traffic and a squealing from the plumbing (maybe this is very common in NYC?); but to be fair, we had just spent 10 hours at the airport only to be told our flight was cancelled so I may not have been very patient with small inconveniences at this point. Ask for an upper floor if available.";5
old hotel, additional charges even for your luggage keeping etc. no refrigerator no coffee machine , old decorations useless bathroom equipments. but the location is good, just the location is good :);2
For an older hotel, we had a great stay.  It is right downtown and the beds are excellent.  The room size was ample compared to newer hotels we have stayed in.  Watch out for the internet and gym.  They charge you!;4
great location, clean secure & friendly must recommend   walking distance from Penn Station. walking distance most of attraction staff was friendly, Missed tea/coffe maker in the room. must provide room service as well;4
Perpect ten! Perfect crew, perfect room, and perfect view! Very safe! without a doubt, we will be coming to this hotel the next time we visit New York, and I have already recommended to everyone I know. Thanks;5
The staff was amazing, both housekeeping & front desk. Security was great! Rooms need an upgrade. The bathroom is very small & old. I’m not a fan of shower/tubs. I prefer walk in showers. The curtains tend to stick to skin.  AC kept shutting off & didn’t seem to be the desired temperature I was aiming for. TV also kept losing connection several times. The floor carpet seemed worn & old. The beds were very comfortable with clean linen.;3
I took my daughter on a trip of a lifetime.I did my reseach and picked The New Yorker because it was moderately  priced and because we took Amtrak we literally walked one and a half blocks from the train station,so close.Since we walked everywhere the hotel was a no brainer,right in the heart of Midtown Manhattan.The hotel was ran just as a good hotel should be.We walked to Empire State,Macy's,Times Square, Rockefeller Center,and Hudson Yard(Highline/The Edge observation tower just to name a few. I recommend this hotel.;4
Nice hotel for a decent price, a short distance from a fairly sketchy area of the city, but it’s NY. What do you expect. Great view of the city from my room, excellent cleaning services provided. Lines were slow for both check-in and check-out. But the stay itself was very nice.;4
I booked our stay for its convenience in location and its fairly reasonable price and it didn’t disappoint! It started with a great experience with the front personnel, specifically Mohammed, who accommodated our needs at check-in. For an 80-yr old hotel, it was updated as best it could to stick with an “art deco” theme. And how cool was it to be on the same floor as the Nicola Tesla room and study?! We found out about it after the fact! Would def book here again!;5
Great time at the New Yorker. Loved the historical feel from the lobby when you walk in, to the rooms themselves, what a great throwback hotel.   We upgraded our room to a Terrace Suite for only $100 more a day, they were going for double that price when trying to reserve. The room had a separate living area from the bedroom, and the beautiful terrace with great city views. The woman at the front desk was extremely helpful also.  To people who are looking to stay here, just realize what this hotel is, it’s a nearly century old classic NYC hotel. The rooms are going to be smaller, you’re not going to have all the modern amenities of a brand new hotel. But you will get a classic experience of what NYC was like in the Golden Age of NYC.;5
"The rooms are tiny but very clean and quiet with thick walls.  Maid service excellent. All basic amenities provided.  The Tick Tock restaurant was typically marginal NY junk fare, but large man at entrance and who served us breakfast was obnoxious, really rude to guests, particularly a Mexican couple: he pointed at them individually and said, ""You!"" as the man was trying to explain something goodheartedly, and made them recite what they wanted and walked away. Really, really rude. Not pleasant to us either although he couldn't have done that.  And he rolled his eyes to us at a man who sat at the wrong table, and made some remark.  He needs therapy and makes everyone feel upset or uncomfortable.  The downstairs restrooms in the morning were filthy on Sunday morning!";4
I’ll start off by saying that I am not the usual tourist who stays in this hotel.  I work in Manhattan but commute into the city each day.  We were supposed to meet family from out-of-town in NYC, but they had to cancel their travel plans due to COVID.  Since it was too late to cancel our reservation without penalty, we decided to stay here for the July 4 weekend.  We arrived at 8:30 p.m. and were checked-in by a very friendly and efficient front desk person.  We were given at room on the 31st floor and the room we had reserved.   The room was smaller than expected.  However, it was laid out well so there was room to move around.  The room was very clean, and the bed was great.  The room featured a Keurig coffee maker with Starbuck’s coffee pods and a small refrigerator.  The;4
We had a great time at the New Yorker. Our room had an outstanding view, the location was perfectly situated near the subway, Times Square and Madison Square Garden! The staff was outstanding and the Tick To k diner was awesome!;4
We loved our stay at The New Yorker! AWESOME customer service! It was incredibly convenient to Penn Station/Amtrak/LIRR, the art deco was beautiful, the Tik Tok diner is connected to the hotel and was excellent, the room was large, quiet and clean - we even had a view of the Hudson River (24th floor, try to get a high floor), the beds were comfortable, there's a CVS & Starbucks across the street, and of course, access to tons of shopping on 34th Street, close to Time's Square and the subway stop is right there.   Did I mention the customer service? Upon arrival at 11pm, the front desk clerk went out of his way outside the hotel to personally show me where the parking lot was (just across the street on 34th, between 7th & 8th). When we asked for a late check-out, they graciously;5
This hotel charges an extra $35 dollars a day for wifi, gym, business center. I had my service charge removed but I bet most people pay it without complaining. This charge was never listed on the Wyndham reservation website.  It’s an extra charge this hotel adds on to the bill to rip you off.  Very shady !;2
First time in NYC. This hotel is not upgraded or fancy in anyway and that’s okay. It was built in the 1920’s and it’s a grand old lady. Parking is down the street for $50 a day with no in and our privileges (but you shouldn’t need your car if you walk or take the metro everywhere). Staff was friendly. Rooms look like they would have back when people lived here in the 1920’s. We reserved a standard room but was upgraded to the family suite. It was very nice. The beds were soft and bedding was clean. The bathtub was an old claw foot tub which made it very classic. To go to the elevators you must show your room key to the attendant who is watching the elevators. The first 19 floors are a student hostel which is very cool. It’s a great way for them to attend school and live off;5
You are unable to take a shower that may produce any amount of steam. AS IT WILL SET OFF THE FIRE ALARM!!! Yes.. steam well set of the fire alarm.  Sadly there is zero amount of exaggeration to my statement.   Two nights in the hotel.. and the fire alarm went off BOTH nights. The first time.. after having just arrived and unpacked with two toddler aged children in tow.. gave us the scare of a lifetime!!! The second time.. we opened the windows as we were instructed by management.. and the fire alarm still went off.  Also.. the phones inside the room do not work. We found this out because when we tried calling the operator/front desk (using the dedicated operator/front desk button) the second time the fire alarm went off.. it would ring to another guest's room. We had to call the;1
We stayed here for a week in September 2016. A huge hotel, but as guests we were made to feel individually welcomed.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, despite being incredibly busy with lots of extra guests for the 9/11 memorial events.   When we arrived our room was at the rear of the hotel with no view. The next morning at my request they gave us a choice of two new rooms with views of the Hudson and the Empire State Building.  The diner on the ground floor is a great place for breakfast, the pancakes were delicious! The hotel is ideally placed for exploring with most things within walking distance, The High Line, Times Square , Broadway and Madison Square Gardens is just next door!  I could not fault the cleanliness of all the amenities at the hotel and would ( and;5
It was great experience at this property. Stay was nice. The room was clean, nice and quite. Check in was so quick by Mrs Ariana. Luckily found parking next to the hotel. Beds were comfy and sleep quality was good. Diner for the Breakfast was also good option. Late check out provide so we could visit Time Square. Overall everything was so nice, no complains. Highly recommended.   Thanks;5
Spent a couple of days at the New Yorker Hotel and enjoyed it thoroughly.  Very reasonable, and friendly staff.  Of particular help to me was Mohammet at the front desk who provided me with a beautiful room with a balcony and spectacular views.  The New Yorker was built in the 1920's and still has many Art Deco details from that era.  A trip back in time in modern New York City.;5
We called the hotel to match state we found online.  Neida answered the call and was amazing at coming close to the quote.  We called back and booked the reservation.  We checked in the very end of May, our room for 3 adults and a child was perfect! Room 2021 had 2 bathrooms!  Security at the hotel is firm but friendly and we had no issues with any service.  Our only regret is we had to leave after 6 days.  What a great hotel and perfect location!;5
Got an upgrade to the room with a fabulous view. Room was clean. Location of hotel is great. But room was super small. Hotel needs some renovation. Unlike other hotels, here Covid used as an excuse not to store luggage. I can't walk around with 2 suitcases, it's so uncomfortable!;2
Amidst the pandemic, I needed a hotel to stay until I could return home. This hotel was well poised w.r.t. location so I booked it. The hotel amenities and COVID protocols were very good, I could see persons cleaning in the lobby all the time, mandatory temperature checks and hand sanitizer on every floor. However, when when I had questions about reservations Neida was the person. She made me feel very comfortable when I had question about literally anything. She always had the time to discuss any issues I had and always a person to her word.  Meeting a person like here during this unusual time we are in was very welcoming.  I would highly recommend this hotel, great location and staff.;4
From the moment we checked in we felt very taken care of. Rooms are clean and location is perfect. A special shout out to Mohammed who helped us with everything we needed! I would definitely return to this hotel on future visits.   Highly recommend!;5
I called the hotel beforehand to ask if I would need to bring a vaccine card since I'm from out of state the the women on the phone told me that would be against HIPAA for a business to ask about that. That is not a true. I had another issue about a lost item and the man at the front desk had no advice to give me and kept bothering the poor security guard. Room was fine, not the cleanest place I've even been but good enough for midtown New York. Convenient to Penn station and the Amtrak station;3
"So I booked this hotel based on the photos I saw of the Standard Room with 2 beds. On them, you can see a spacious room with 2 windows. I even payed a little more for the option that stated ""City View"". I travelled with my boyfriend and my brother and I wanted us to have a lot of space so we wouldn't feel like trapped in a small room. The staff is nice and they check everyone's temperature everytime you enter the hotel. Masks are also required in the common areas. However, when we got to our room it was tiny. There was very little space between the end of the bed and the wall and there was only one window. Also the door to the bathroom wasn't closing properly, we could't lock it so it would remain closed.  I went to the front desk and explained about the bathroom door and showed";4
Hotel is very convenient to many attractions.  Best water pressure I have ever experienced in a hotel. Daily housekeeping and security check in which I was expecting so clean and safe. Housekeeping very prompt, requested a coffee maker for our room and was probably there in 15 mins. There was no refrigerator in my room, only downfall because we brought stuff that need refrigeration and couldn’t bring leftovers back to the room.;4
Everything was perfect, room was clean. Staff was friendly. Everything was within walking distance. Perfect location. Private bedroom with sleeper sofa in living room.  Time Square is within walking distance. Pinn station is across the street.;5
Overall I am very happy I stayed at the New Yorker. Great value, Great location. There was a minor issue on arrival which was completely resolved by Michael, who was the manager on the night I was checking in. He is a true professional.  Both restaurants at the hotel were very good as well. I would stay at this hotel again.;5
The room was very dirty and old not what they marketing on the website, I had to call to change to another room because someone was smoking marijuana in a room. Many people walking in the halway during night making a lot of noise. During the day to checkout I was told I could checkout at 12:30pm so I went to take a breakfast, when I returning for my backpack around 12:05pm the room was locked and I could not open the door, I had to went to the lobby and wait for 20 minutes to someone to attend me, I would not recommend this hotel.;1
Enjoyed my stay, great staff, love the onsite food options, beautiful lobby, central location, easy to get transportation from building, love the Tik Tok + the tavern + steak house—-fantastic shower with hot hot water and strong water pressure, updated room with easy to use tv;5
Bernice went above and beyond to help plan for our trip! She was extremely friendly and made sure every need was met and more! I’ve been to 1000+ hotels and by far she was the best customer service employee i have ever encountered! I will be staying at the hotel again just based on Bernice!;5
"This Blast-from-the-Past ""4-star"" hotel across from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden provided a stunning view of the Empire State Building and plenty of hot water, but in other respects was lacking: 1. 40-minute check-in. 2. 40 more minutes to buy an extra night. 3. Bed made but sheets not changed. 4. Room not cleaned, garbage not emptied. 5. 30-second minimum wait before elevator doors close. 6. 30-second ""temperature"" screening and mugshot every time you enter. 7. Desk clerk insists you confirm purchase by entering PIN number, but refuses to show you bill on screen or on paper--or even give you receipt for your payment. (!!)  The list goes on . . .";1
every time i come to new york i always choose this hotel i feel like home very comfortable and clean the service are so great and the breakfast menu and the morning coffee   the only this i don’t like is the lunch   lunch meals is not enough for me always a little;5
I'm a new customer to the New Yorker and this will also be my first trip to New York City. I originally called just to get a rate on a room to compare prices. When I called I had the privilege to speak with Bernice! She may possibly be  the nicest, most helpful and patient woman I've ever talked to! She was on the phone with me for over an hour and not only answered all of my questions but went above and beyond to help my family and I find the best deal! We decided to book with the New Yorker solely based off of her customer service. All I can say is Bernice definitely deserves a raise or a promotion of some sort! Thank you Bernice! -Parker Branz;5
The rooms were clean. The staff was responsive and courteous. I enjoyed chatting with hotel security. I was impressed with their COVID screening procedures in the lobby and their procedures for securing patrons  I will return for more stays!;5
We had more than a few problems with our trip, and had to change our plans last minute. I can honestly say that I have never felt so well looked after, and found the hotel extremely understanding and accomodating to our needs. We were lucky enough to be dealt with by a very professional and courteous lady named Neida, who kindly managed to work everything out for us in an extremely prompt and professional manner. We will 100% visit this hotel in the future.;5
I just had one of the best surprises of my long travel life.   The New Yorker hotel in New York City. From Check-in to Checkout this hotel rocks for an affordable hotel in Manhattan. Now I wish I got names, but I am bad at this.   The lady at check-in was courtesy and very helpful.  I had two rooms 3012 which is a good-sized Queen Suite and 2249 which is a Family Two Bed suite with Terrace.   Both rooms were spotless and in great condition.   Room 3012 was on the executive floor which was the latest renovated floor.   Room 2249 was not as newly renovated but in wonderful shape.  The bathrooms were appointed well with even extra towels in the closet.   There is no surprise the rooms are spotless.  You could tell the housekeepers on both floors were well experienced and each time;5
Hotel has such a history and even though a little dated, it's fun to realize the stories it witnessed. Mohammed was great at the front desk on check-in and the restaurant staff, especially Salvador, were awesome. It was just a quick overnight visit for an appointment, but they made it feel special!!!;5
The rooms are too small and very uncomfortable, you can barely move around in them. The bathroom ceiling leaked, and it creeped me out. Most of the staff was rude. This was the worse hotel experience I ever had!!!;1
We chose The New Yorker for its location, aesthetic, and interesting history. Erica, the guest services director, and her staff were amazing with their attention to the guest experience. She went above and beyond and was able to actually show us the Nikola Tesla suite- which, for us, was incredible. Our accommodations were beautiful- we had the good fortune to be upgraded to a terrace suite! The view, the comfort, the convenience- perfect. We will absolutely return. Thanks!;5
We got upgraded to a SUITE which had a balcony with views of the Empire State, Chrysler, Freedom Tower, and everything in between. Simply beautiful. Aside from the view and the extra space that came with the suite, the staff was amazing, specially Mohammed at the front desk. Also, I really appreciated all of the measures they are taking for COVID. Very pleased with my stay. I will definitely be coming back.;5
After booking thru a site with “non refundable” charges, what are you supposed to do when you’re hit with a “cleaning fee” basically doubling the cost of the room.  This is one of the dirtiest scumiest things I’ve ever encountered.   Stay away. If you think you’re getting a good deal, you’re not.;1
We stayed at the New Yorker March 18-22, 2021. The hotel was lovely and everything we hoped for, but the amazing customer service will definitely bring us back again.  We booked this hotel and used a special promotion that they were offering. When we received the confirmation it did not include the promotion. We then called the hotel and spoke with Naida. She assured us that it would be honored.  Upon check out we noticed again that the promotion was not included. Once again Naida stepped up and assured us that she would take care of this matter. It ook multiple phone calls and emails back and forth as she gathered information, but she never gave up until she was able to solve our issue.  We travel frequently and she was one of the most kind and helpful people we have ever met.;5
"During the reservation process I was told that the AAA rate was better than the military and that it even included parking and breakfast (which was too good to be true in NYC); none of the three things proved to be true and accurate. During the checkout I told the frontdesk that I felt tricked about the rate (AAA vs. Military - being active duty myself) and the rude response from the lady was to call the accounting department and complaint to them, without giving me any real solution...  I had a problem with the bathroom, the toilet was DIRTY outside from previous owners (not going to what was on it) and even though I informed immediately to the frontdesk, it took more that 24 hours and a second complaint to clean the bathroom. If that is with the regular cleaning, I could not";1
Here is a huge shout out to Mohammad at reception!!!!  He went above and beyond for my girls and made them feel welcome from the start!!! My daughters were reunited after months for a long Easter weekend stay at the hotel.  They had a blast in the city!  Great city view from their room,   Great security in hotel,  Awesome staff!;5
I stayed 5 nights with my 12 year old daughter. During check-in Muhammad was very nice and helpful! He went out of his way for us (we had a rough previous 12 hours of travel).  The hotel is almost 100 years old, but it is very clean. Heat, a/c, hot water all worked perfect. It looks like the bathroom fixtures might be original. They well kept, but definitely the old style. Beds are comfortable. Had an awesome view, could see Empire State Building from my bed. We had two double with metro view room. It is connected to the Tick Tock Dinner which is convenient and delicious. There are two other restaurants, but we didn't try them. I recommend this hotel. The art deco style was so cool, I loved. Good location. Just a few steps from Penn Station which is convenient. We were easily;5
Loved the Hotel room was very nice and comfortable. In a nice location and you feel very safe. Staff is very helpful and the price is exceptional. Only issue we had was we waited a little bit to check in but they were very busy. Daughter modeled in fashion show there and had a blast!!;5
All the staff are extremely nice and helpful but I would like to specifically find out Neida! She helped me to get all the amenities I was looking for and once the extra mile to help me dress up the room to surprise my wife! Also Bernice was extremely helpful and giving me clarification and making sure I got the right room and altogether piece of mind! A very pleasant experience!;5
The location of this place is such, you walk to all the major tourist destination. The staffs are amazing. Rooms are on a smaller side. Also, cleaning could improve. Don't get us wrong, hotel and rooms are clean;4
I stayed in the New Yorker Hotel in a Queen suite on the 22nd floor with city views from the terrace.   Pros: - The suite with two connected rooms and two bathrooms gave my family enough space to spread out.  - Rooms were very clean and the bed/mattress was very comfortable and firm.  - Terrace was probably the single best feature of the room with breathtaking city views facing east.  - Historic Art Deco charm and variety of room types. - Location, location, location - close to Penn station, K town, Times Square, subway station on same block.  - Good security for hotel guests   Cons: - Front desk service felt a bit rough around the edges. They gave me a hard about holding my luggage until checkin. They finally relented, however why isn’t this a standard service at a 3 star;4
I’ve been going to this beautiful hotel for 10 years!! Beautiful. Perfect location for NYC!! I keep coming back to because of the team here too. Every visit is an incredible one. This visit was a big WOW. Nereida A. Made my husband birthday incredible. Room was all decorated with a delicious birthday cake from Angelinas. Thank you so mmuch Nereida!! We will be back;5
Since the pandemic occurred, recreational activities has decreased whereas it’s difficult to celebrate things like birthdays etc. Despite the difficulties, I decided to go to The New Yorker Hotel to celebrate my birthday and the staff, Neida & Ramona, ensured that my stay and birthday celebration was extraordinarily awesome!!! They decorated my room with balloons and BDay card even going an extra step by ensuring I had the best room ever. The staff is Awesome!!! Thank you;5
Just finished a 4 night stay with 2 rooms.  Front desk staff member, Mohamed set me up with great city views of The Empire State Building which looks great at night (red on Valentine’s Day and red,white and blue on President’s day).  Double room is a good size room, the single queen is small.  Hotel is very historic and very cool!  Staff is well trained.  Rates are reasonable would definitely go back!;5
I was a guest at the New Yorker  for NYFW 2.0 and I booked my room directly with the hotel.  I received superb assistance with my reservation  by Neida - she went above and beyond to make sure our stay was the best.  We had a beautiful large room with a view of the river on the 35th floor and once we checked  in she called me to make sure I was pleased with the room as well as after my departure.  I will definitely return to the New Yorker in future trips, it was close to transportation, shopping and the Lincoln tunnel.  Also available was the TickToc Dinner- make sure you ask for waffle fries instead of stick fries.   On a separate note: QuickPark that is affiliated with the hotel or the one parking facility that offers a discount to guest dropped the ball - we were overcharged;5
We stayed at the New Yorker the last two days. Neida specifically at the front desk went above and beyond to help us with coordinating checkout with events we had going on. They also were amazing during the check in process. The whole staff did an amazing job keeping a large number of people safe. It is a gorgeous hotel! Definitely old hotel feel but gorgeous! Views from the upper floors are amazing!;5
I have stayed in the New Yorker twice first in 2015 with friends and again in 2018 i took my granddaughter for her birthday,and i just loved it!!!!, staff are amazing rooms very comfortable beds are a dream to sleep in spotlessley clean,Hopefully the same group of friends will be at the New Yorker this December i cannot wait and again next year for my grandaughters 13th and my 60th look forward to seeing your friendley faces in this amazing hotel and city;5
Wow!!!!  I have booked a ton of rooms and had all different types of service in doing so. Naida, by far, has surpassed in understanding, caring, helping, accommodating and just being friendly and kind. She cares about the people she serves and goes above and beyond to make you feel important and that your stay and comfort matter. There should be more dedicated employees like her. Coworkers take note. Thank you for making my booking experience anything but a nightmare. I look forward to my stay and dropping in to say hi personally!!  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻;5
Our family stayed in the New Yorker over the New Year's weekend.  Your team did a great job ensuring a comfortable stay, despite the prevailed Government-mandated Covid restrictions.  Some comments:  - Everyone from reception/check-in to concierge and housekeeping was very positive and helpful.  One of the concierges spent about 15 minutes running down a long list of good suggestions to keep our six-year-old entertained, and told the whole story about Nikola Tesla's residence at New Yorker. - The remodeled bathrooms, with the full-floor showers, are a nice touch. - Many sites in the city are open for visitors, including Liberty cruises, One World Trade, and the American Museum.  Crowds are, for the first time in my memory, manageable. - Restaurants are closed, except for those;5
My daughter brought me to New York as a 60 th Birthday present and we stayed in the NewYorker and were not disappointed with our stay rooms were very comfortable and spotless, should I ever get the opportunity to come back to your fabulous city I will be staying in the Newyorker;5
I stayed there for an incredible weekend, very cozy place!  loved it!. My room was super clean and tidy.  The team is very dedicate. The decor is impeccable, with great taste, i will return to other opurtunities.;4
Miss Neida Aldama, the communication Manager at the New Yorker Hotel, was very helpfull with our booking. She was so nice to sort out everything and contacted us several times to make sure that everything came well. Thank you so much for all the work you put in. We realy appreciate it.;5
Our stay at The New Yorker Hotel was truly exceptional!  We were celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary and we booked a two-room suite with a terrace.  We asked for a room with a great view and the staff listened & delivered.  The view from our room was AMAZING!  The staff at the hotel went above and beyond to make our stay a pleasant one.  Special thanks to Erica L., Ramona & Mohammad who were especially helpful.  We would recommend The New Yorker Hotel to anyone visiting the city.  We even loved the photos and news articles on the lower level depicting the history of this iconic hotel.  The convenient location, the wonderful staff, and the memorable views all made for an unforgettable stay in NYC!;5
We were forced to cancel our trip and stay here this month due COVID-19 reasons. Neida was super helpful and made the cancellation process very easy for us. Customer service is is definitely a 10/10!!!;5
We stayed here for over a week during our trip to new york last year ... the best thing about the hotel is the location... we were in room number 2222 and had a view of the Empire State Building and madison square garden ... we loved the overall service and hospitality and enjoyed some nice treats at tick todk diner too ... hoping to visit again very soon ... for more food and travel updates follow our page on instagram —  bhavna and shahaan thank you;4
Myself and my partner had booked our holiday to NYC through a travel agents so we didn’t have much choice as far as hotels went. We arrived at the New Yorker and immediately were told we had to pay a $250 fee as “insurance” which was the first red flag, I was aware that there are city taxes etc but when booking I had asked my travel agent to find out was there any other fees and they had told me there were not going to be. After reluctantly paying the $250 we then went up to our room which was probably one of the smallest hotels rooms I’ve ever been in ( I was expecting small but not this small and especially for the price) and our view was facing another wall! We were also told that our price included breakfast which turned out to only be a pastry and coffee each morning. I’m;2
"I was very impressed by the hospitality of the staff. Everyone was warm and inviting, and the amenities were fantastic. Although I was located in center of everything, I found my favorite place to eat was ""Tick Tock.""  The food was great and the service provided was awesome. Cant say enough good things about my stay. I highly recommend booking your vacation and or business stay here.";5
We make lots of 2-3 day NY trips over the course of the year and need to stay in and around mid-town. SInce we take the Amrtak in, the New Yorker is great because its across the street from Penn. It also had VERY reasonably priced large suites AND the Tic Toc diner (24/7 when we aren't in the middle of COVID) is great for meals. Also, its a quick trip to all the theatrical stuff we need to do (rehearsals, auditions, training, etc.) and with the A Train RIGHT there, we can easily shoot uptown to see our son in Washington Heights. So very convenient, big rooms, good food, easy access to theatrical stuff all at a terrific price makes it our go to.;5
Overall nice place. We were expecting a luxury  hotel based on photos price and review but it was pretty average. Dated rooms and amenities. The security guard is super judgmental too, he stopped me like five times and told me that I was not staying in the hotel and nobody was even occupying a room on my floor!?!!?;1
Hotel was very nice. The location was more than perfect! In the heart of Manhattan. The room was very small. But you can find everything you need in the room. The metro, bus, trainstation was very close to the hotel.  We enjoyed!;4
small rooms and upon looking over the room a huge cockroach flew out of the bathroom. I didn't want to go downstairs empty handed so I attempted to find it by looking under the curtains and saw a previous guests toothbrush. Went back downstairs and was given another room. Needless to say I didn't sleep much that night and left very early the next morning. They're currently checking the temperature of all visitors to before entering. This is known useless, I wouldn't be surprised if some higher-ups cousin sold them those things. I suppose they may turn away 1 or 2 people over the pandemic, but a temperature check doesn't catch the people who are asymptomatic or are building up. I guess it's pandemic theater and thank you for wasting my time waiting in line EVERY TIME I went back;2
Great stay here. The health & safety measures including temperature scans upon entrance mitigated my nervousness about staying during the pandemic. Mohammed at the front desk was extremely helpful and kind in accommodating me with everything I needed in a quick and efficient manner. Can’t thank the staff enough!;5
We came here a week before Christmas and was one of the best holidays ever!  The hotel has a beautiful lobby with a big Christmas tree that made us feel at home! Our rooms were modern, big enough for the two of us and very clean!  The location of this hotel is perfect it is right opposite maddison square gardens and a stone throw away from Macys/ Hooters/ Victorias Secret etc couldn’t ask for a better location.  Only cons I would say is the water provided in the room is not free and you are charged id you drink it!   The next time we come to new york this is the place we will be staying thanks guys!;5
During this pandemic, I had to go to new york and I decided to stay at the new yorker hotel. Everything it's very disturbing with the pandemic situation that the last thing that you need is that the employees of the hotel treat you badly.  I got the worst experience ever with a lady working at night time as a security and taking your temperature every time that you go in and out of the hotel. very annoying. she wasn't nice or kind. she treated me badly, she was very mean. There is another guy that works at night, Asian. He wasn't professional at all. Neither of them was.  they shouldn't treat clients badly.  I won't ever come back and I DO NOT recommend this hotel at all. plus, in these pandemic times.;1
Loved everything about this fabulous hotel.  The place, the staff, the location...FLAWLESS.  Extremely art deco, the level below the lobby is actually a small museum dedicated to the history of the place.   Throughout the lobby and other areas, there’s just vintage beauty in every corner!  Love this place.   Oh, and exceptional water pressure in the rooms!;5
Great location for a renowned New York hotel that offers rooms, some of which have a beautiful view. Extra charges for internet access are very expensive and mandatory. It’s not the best hotel in New York, but I’ll always remember it forever.;4
We were glad to see when we arrived that serious protocols were in place to ensure the safety of guests. No need to touch the revolving door, it is motion sensitive. Your body temperature is taken as you enter by a camera monitoring system which is attended to by a hotel employee. Hand sanitizer is readily available all over the hotel lobby and floors. Spacing protocols are also enforced, even in the elevators. The room was clean and inviting. Plastic coverings on the remotes, as well as sanitary wipes on nightstands and tables. The front desk was kind enough to provide us with a late check out! We would surely stay here again.;5
I stayed here many years ago and was planning to visit this year and twice have had to reorganise my plans because of Covid 19  The hotel kindly allowed me to refund my bookings despite a non refundable booking  Fantastic customer service and as soon as it’s safe to do so l will be in NYC and will use this hotel again;5
Great hotel for a family break. We were given a corner room which was huge by the standards of other city hotels. Staff were friendly and the hotel was clean and provided all we needed. Excellent location.;5
Emergency trip to Washington DC from NYC. This hotel provided no drinks available or snacks upon arrival. Electrician guy provided door bell/ door knock flasher for my hotel room was good.  Television was without closed captions.;4
We booked the New Yorker and weren’t greeted when we arrived. We were confronted to stand and take a photo for a temperature check without any explanation or at least a “Welcome to the New Yorker, please stand here for your temper check.” The staff in general were dismissive, dry, and it felt like we were intruding on their space. We booked a stay at Arlo Soho for the remainder of our trip because we refuse to pay for services that are subpar. The best part of the NewYorker was exiting with our luggage in hand and 3 staff members watching us leave without even saying thank you for coming. We’ve never experienced hotel service as such. We just checked in to Arlo Soho and the experience was night and day, as it should be. However, I appreciate the clean room and hot shower.;2
This is our go-to hotel when we are in NYC. The location is phenomenal, the hotel is very clean. It has a 24 hour restaurant/bar and great customer service. Why stay anywhere else? I recently had an issue with a cancellation and called the reservations department who were very helpful. They transferred me to the front desk and I was fortunate enough to get connected to Neida! She was so helpful! Very friendly and efficient. She handled the issue quickly and so professionally!  Thanks Neida- I will be sure to say hi in person on our next visit!;5
After an enjoyable stay in 2019, we booked again for February 2020. We arrived and were checked in by a really friendly staff member (Krystal) we were allocated a room with an amazing view which made our stay even more enjoyable. The hotel is in a great location. We will definitely be visiting again next year.;5
The hotel is in a great location. The hotel is outdated and desperately needs renovation. Rooms are pretty small, showers are from 1930. Very authentic, but not in a good way. Way too expensive for what you get.;2
During my stay it was high season and the room costed +500$ a night, as metropole hotelroom prices yield. So in this case I must considerer price-value more conciously as ever before. LOCATION-LOCATION-LOCATION and well cleaned!  Furthermore: the hotel is poorly maintaned and service is very unpersonal;3
Have stayed hers before, was due again this month.  Due to the virus we cannot travel and have had to defer the holiday until next year 2021..  We are lucky that we have a member of staff who is caring and understanding!  Her name is Neida Aldama!  What a brilliant person who has helped us all the way with our cancellation and rebooking a new holiday!  There has been a small charge in line with the cancellation criteria but I am sure we will not lose out with this Lady looking after us!  I want to thank her and all the staff who have helped us !  Well done the New Yorker!;5
My stay at The New Yorker Hotel was amazing.  I am a nurse who went to help out during the pandemic.  I stayed at this hotel for over two months and received the best hospitality from all of the staff.  My housekeeper (Luz) was an amazing person.  She went above and beyond to ensure my room was clean and I had everything I needed.  I’ve been back home for over a week now and had to leave a package because it hadn’t arrived in time before I had to catch my flight.  I called to the hotel to ensure my package was still there and the front desk rep (Neida) verified and suggested a hassle free way for me to get my package shipped to me.  She provided me her email address so that she could print out the label and have it ready for UPS to pick it up.  She and Ms. Henry (Security;5
I’ve been staying at the New Yorker for work for 79 days now for work. I’ve had some pretty rough experiences due to work and life experiences but the day I was able to talk with Neida was AMAZING!!!! She went out of her way to help me and just made my day without even knowing it. She was so professional, sweet and pleasant. It was such a blessing to be able to deal with her. So again I say THANK YOU!!!!! 💋💋💋💋  -Latasha HeadRN;5
When I found out that I had to change hotel I was not happy but I was happy that I had the pleasure to meet Naida who is a front desk representative who went above and beyond to make us frontliners feel at home away from home. Thank you so much Naida for all you do.;5
Needa and the crew here were amazing!  Went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable. Great staff and awesome facility. It's been a pleasure staying here while working through this pandemic. A home away from home.;5
During my call to the 1800 number yesterday, my experience was not very well. The 1st Rep did not really know how to help me and just had me on hold until I was transfer to Neida and let me tell you if she is not the best in there at what she do i don't know who is. She heard me out and she went above and beyond to make sure my needs were met. The level of service her and her team provided exceeded my expectations, I mean we were back and forth for like 2 hours so I really appreciate great customer service especially during these stressful times. I felt like I knew her she was so kool and I hope to meet her during my stay.;5
We arrived after a long trip from the UK into the Wyndham New Yorker. Check in was fast. The receptionist took our passports and realised it was my partners 40th birthday while staying at the hotel. They upgraded us to a city view (very nice touch) we were amazed. We went up to our room on the 36th floor, pulled the curtains open and WOW! The Empire State Building was right in front of us. It was amazing! We could also see Maddison Square Garden.  The rooms are kept clean at all times. We speak more time in ours room than we would of liked due to New York doing into lock down due to Covid-19. The decor is art decor and in places, looks amazing, but in some parts, needs updating and looking after.  We ate in ten Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel a couple of times. The food;5
My family and I had planned a trip but due to COVID it got cancelled. However, the staff at New Yorker, particularly Neida Aldama, communicated with us in detail and clarified all our doubts. The hotel gave us a voucher to be used since it was a non-refundable booking, and Neida played a really important role in communicating between us and the hotel back and forth. She’s warm, welcoming, nice, kind and an excellent staff, and I hope to meet her whenever me and my family plan to use the voucher to stay at the New Yorker!;5
Spoke with Neida (assistant manager for reservations) regarding a past reservation I had to cancel due to COVID-19. She was so friendly, professional and very helpful! I would definitely recommend!!!!;5
Hey having a great time in the hotel,  great rooms great views,  even extended my stay,  staff are doing a great job helping the front line staff, close to everything, I can even see the Empire State Building from my room.;4
I made a reservation at the New  Yorker for a solo train trip thru multiple states in mid March. I came down with the mild version of COVID and could not travel.  The cancellation policy was a 48 hour window and I called as soon as I knew I was unable to travel.  After speaking to many people and having many discussions about my cancellation and refunds I spoke to Naeda who helped and listened to the situation.  I know that many businesses are having difficulty especially with so many cancellations, but she took the time to listen and help me solve the problem.  When my train trip is rescheduled, I will definitely stay at the New Yorker and make sure I get a chance to meet Naeda in person.  We shared a great conversation about the world today and when I hung up, felt like the;5
I'm baffled by some of the reviews. This hotel is fantastic and the staff are AMAZING!   We stayed for 8 nights and have to say the hotel location, staff and experience added to our wonderful trip.   Staff members Samira and Driss were fantastic. Kept an eye on us all week to make sure we were enjoying our stay and always gave us great advice and tips to improve our New York experience. Honestly they went above and beyond what they needed to. I travel and use many hotels, and I have to say their customer service was one of the best I've received in recent times. There was also a female concierge, whose name I forgot to jot down (sorry) she also gave us some unique tourist tip ideas which allowed us to see things in New York that we couldn't find from generic websites.   The;5
Stayed at the New Yorker in March just as Carona Virus was about to hit, possibly not the best time to visit New York but didn't queue to visit anything which was great. The New Yorker Hotel was very clean and the location couldn't have been better, just up the way from the Empire State Building and central for all the sites we wanted to visit. We were on the 34th floor of the Hotel. The room was very clean but also small but ideal  for a long weekend which we were doing for my wifes Birthday with Friends. The staff were all friendly and gave us the best routes to take. We had planned to walk to the Statue of Liberty which we did the first full day(about 6 miles each way) walking along the Hudson River to keep away from crouds and took in the sights along the way. Second full;4
Good hotel right near to the Empire State Building. Only reason I scored so low is this - I paid a lot of money to stay here for a week - then upon arrival I had to pay a service/resort fee of nearly 250 dollars - all this got me was poor WiFi!     Apart from that the rooms were clean and today - great views and lobby area was tidy  Bed was comfy and bathroom has everything we needed;3
I had a trip planned to visit this hotel next month and had to unfortunately cancel due to the global pandemic. My trip was non-refundable, I knew that when I booked it. This was 2 months ago before COVID-19 came along. I reached out to the hotel and explained my situation. One of the hotel representatives, Nalda, went above and beyond with her customer service to allow a refund due to the circumstances. This representative contacted the third-party that I booked through and facilitated details back and forth. Her turn around time was excellent with me and I was beyond satisfied with the outcome! I would definitely recommend this hotel based off of the customer service alone! Thank you again to this hotel.;5
Ms. Neida  went above and beyond her way to make sure my stay was comfortable.  Also, helped me by extending my stay in an excellent window view room. With her exceptional service she made sure I stayed in the same room during my second visit. I am extremely satisfied and will stay in the same hotel when i return to New York from Houston.;5
We stayed at the New Yorker mid February being a family of 4. Ill give an honest review Im a UK travel agent so I'm used to reviewing and staying in many hotels. I had booked this via a supplier a good year in in advance so the reviews were better when I booked  Firstly the good, the hotel is in a great location it really is so easy to get around and you can pretty much walk everywhere. Thats about it as far as the positive, the hotel in my opinion needs a really good update. i ended up having to upgrade my room on arrival which cost another 200 dollars on top of the standard room. This room was a lot larger and comfortable but the standard rooms really do need to be refurnished and a true idea of the rooms in the pictures displayed. With another 47 dollars a night resort fees;3
I was going to NYC to see Elton John and was to stay at The New Yorker. Well... neither happened. I had made non-refundable reservations but called the hotel to see if their policy would change during this crisis. Every person I spoke to was so nice and helpful. One person that really stood out was Neida Aldama, a supervisor at the front desk. She was incredibly kind and compassionate about the situation, and offered that my prepayment be used as a credit that I can apply anytime in the next year (hopefully if/when Elton John reschedules!!). I feel that this was very generous, given the fact that they had every right to tell me I was SOL. Neida even went so far as to call me to directly answer a question I had. I know that they are dealing with a lot and are working with a;5
"Hotel looks posh.  Room small but adequate and dated (plumbing ancient!) What REALLY annoyed us was they quote a low price to get to the top of search engines then add a COMPULSORY ""facilities charge"" of over $40!! We were not able to use any of the facilities due to our short stay.  This is ILLEGAL in the UK.  You have to advertise the price customers actually pay.  A shame the US hasn't caught up with modern consumer protection.";2
We were due to make our first ever visit to the USA to attend my daughter's graduation. It should have been the trip of a lifetime but everything was cancelled due to Covid 19 and we were facing heavy financial losses as well as the prospect of my daughter now stranded in the USA by herself. At a time of real stress and anxiety for our family I cannot praise this hotel highly enough and in particular Herbert Perez who went above and beyond to help me. When these awful times are finally behind us I will make that visit to New York, I will book into the New Yorker Hotel and I will thank him in person for his compassion. God Bless and take care x;5
I organization were scheduled for a very large event this year in New York. Due to the world events of the coronavirus everything was brought to a screaming halt. We've stayed with the New Yorker for every visit to NYC for the last 20 years because of their hospitality. We will continue to stay for the following 20. Their understanding of the events of 2020 were exceptional. I personally want to thank Neida and her team for the exceptional customer service provided to myself and my team.    Best wishes,;5
My organization had booked a reservation with a third party for this week. We've had to cancel due to the coronavirus outbreak and it has been a hassle dealing with the third party but the staff at the New Yorker have been absolutely amazing. They have been so gracious and helpful in getting us the assistance we have been needing. In particular Naida has been such an amazing help. She has been so patient in working with me to get this resolved as quickly and as expertly as possible. Her warmth and friendliness on the phone has been very helpful during this difficult time!   Thanks for all your help!  Karina;5
Due to the coronavirus I have to cancel my reservation, it was booked on hotel.com I did not cancel early enough so I was charge for $168 ,I recently contacted the hotel a young lady name Neida was a great help , I definitely will rebook with the hotel rebook with this Hotel again;5
Like a LIGHTHOUSE in the sky, with the EMPIRE and THE CHRYSLER BUILDING, the New Yorker, today changed to the WINDHAM NEW YORKER HOTEL is a very excelent option to be in NEW YORK. Not cheap, because the price of the HOTELS in NYC are veryyy expensive but...HUGE and NICE!!!;4
Wonderful place to stay! Nadie and staff were very accommodating with my medical situation and ensured I had all my needs met! Nadie even went over and beyond to make sure I knew of all the food spots that offered discounts as this chick never likes to pay full price if I don’t have too!;5
Stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights before joining a cruise (which was subsequently cancelled). Location was superb, great if you like walking as we walked to most of the attractions even the Statten Island ferry, albeit a long way!! On arrival check in was really quick and efficient with friendly staff.  We had a problem with the cleanliness of the shower on the first night and Crystal was superb in recognising the problem and moved us to a far nicer room. Next time we would definitely ask for one of the refurbished rooms as the previous room was quite dated.  We ate in the restaurant one night and the meal was fantastic.  Would definitely return.;4
Had a great stay here got back on 17th March just as New York was closing all bars and restaurants the New Yorker is a good hotel very good location this was our 3rd stay this time it was to celebrate granddaughters 21st birthday she hadn't been before even though new York was shutting down we had a wonderful time;5
Just got back from a 7 day stay. The staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough to help (especially the lady on reception - didn't get her name but she is due to become a grandmother in a couple of months!) It was a difficult time for the staff with the coronavirus hitting hard but the cleanliness was  1st class and they were actively didinfecting everything. We would go back in a heartbeat. All staff were so friendly from concierges to housekeeping. Beautiful hotel.;5
We are a family of 4 who stayed here in October 2019. The rooms are compact but clean and we had a partial view of the empire state. We were lucky enough to have a coffee machine in the room to get us started for the day but I'm not sure this is in every room. This hotel is in a really good location for all attractions and we would stay here again if we had another trip to the big apple. The only negatives would be the extra price of the city tax which I think is high and the fact they charge you to hold your luggage (per case too) in a room on check out day is ridiculous. Never had this in any other hotel in the world!!;3
We came here in Feb for 4 nights.  Have to say I was impressed with hotel. Fab location near to everything. Close to bus station too so jersey gardens was easy to get too. Room was small but very clean. Cleaned all days I think .. would have no prob recommending or staying again;4
"I was hesitant after reading so many negative reviews but here I am relaxing in a pretty nice family terrace suite with an amazing view of the city! Contrary to what others have said, the beds are comfy & clean, the bathroom in clean and well stocked, even the sofa bed is nice and as new as any other hotel sofa bed. We have a dining table, fridge, great TV reception, comfortable climate control and the room smells nice & fresh. The hallways coming to our room are also nice & fresh. Is the hotel old, yes. Is it ""luxurious"", not exactly BUT for its time, yes it's pretty darned awesome! As with ANY hotel, we practiced general rules - no bare feet and don't assume it's just like home. Thousands of people are in and out no matter how ""fancy"" the hotel is. I'm hoping my photos prove";4
Three of us stayed in a suite and the space was amazing and clean. We had a great view of Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens. The hotel was quiet except for the outside sounds which are simply sounds of the city. The location is great with quick access to shopping and a few minutes to Times Square. The hotel is older so not as modern as expected but the space, cleanliness and location made it an excellent choice.;5
The New Yorker is in a great location! Hotel staff was friendly, nice hotel. Room was a definitely outdated could definitely use a face lift. Was double charged for something, but the front desk was very prompt in fixing it.;4
Just back from 4 days at the new Yorker hotel.Check in was great no probs, lady at desk was great, quick & helpful,Room was on 36th floor with some great views over new York, 6 lifts only 2 working(being updated soon)witch resulted in queueing & long waits especially morning time(so allow more time). The Room was very small but adequate for time were there. The bed was very comfortable clean & tidy with good house keeping every day. We only slept & washed as out all day & night. We used Tic tock dinner for breakfast as it was convenient But tasty with a typical New York menu or what ever you wanted & coffee refills.The hotel is OLD & dated & in need of renovation but don't let that put you off. The LOCATION is wonderful if you're visiting New York city with all big attractions;3
We stayed here in March for 5 nights, the location is perfect for NYC- easy to get to everywhere and a metro very close by. Only reason this is not a 5/5 is because the rooms could do with an update (although not a major problem as we didn’t spend much time in the room) and the shower head was so powerful it hurt!! We would stay again.  Also, we booked through Virgin Holidays and therefore did not have to pay the additional fee people have mentioned on here.;4
This was my first stay at the New Yorker and it was a pleasant one. I attended NYFW which was held at the hotel. The rooms are small. Everything was clean and it was a nice room. Loved the restautrant Tic-Toc in the hotel. I had some amazing meals there.;4
"We stayed in the hotel for four nights in late February, a nice welcome at check in and offered complimentary breakfast ""grab and go"" style from the coffee kiosk in the main reception, the room was nice newly refurbished on 21st floor while  the public parts of the hotel could do we updating. The staff were very friendly and accommodating to any request. The best part about the hotel is it's location on 8th Ave, three subway stops uptown and you are in Central Park, four subway stops and you are on Broad St. ground zero, one tower observatory etc.. and then only a few blocks walk you are at the Port Authority bus station for those in need of retail therapy and a trip to jersey gardens (Bus111 $14 return), also hotel directly opposite Madison Square Garden I would highly";4
It’s not a glitzing hotel, the rooms are basic but clean, the plumbing is noisy but hey your on holiday, not in the room for long.  Everyone is so friendly from  check in to the staff constantly cleaning....we were there at the start of corona virus!  Very central for getting anywhere great door men!;4
The New Yorker is the first hotel we have used in NYC. It was recommended to us by a friend due to its location. It is really close to Penn station meaning train travel from the airport (JFK in our case) was really simple plus there was no lugging cases round the city as we were in the hotel in a matter of 2 minutes. The subway is served by Penn station too so really easy to navigate the city. The hotel is one of the oldest in NYC but is well maintained and our room (3132) was clean and tidy as were the public areas. Check in was simple and quick and we were made to feel welcomed. There are plenty of lifts and they are split equally to serve the bottom half of the hotel (lobby to floor 20) and the top half (floor 21 to floor 40).  Our upgraded room was cleaned on a daily basis;5
We stayed at this hotel for 4 nts at the end of Feb 2020. I booked This through my travel agency business so i knew it had mixed reviews.  We actually really enjoyed it. Location is excellent, the room was clean and beds were super comfy. Bathroom was small but hey you only clean in there. The view was great of the Hudson River and Police precinct. We loved it. Yes it was old but thats the history. Only real issue we had was the lifts taking forever when we were on 35th floor, but nothing a-bit of problem solving cannot handle.  Love love loved it. Thank you NY;4
Great location, service, style, and price.  Close to everything (walked to many NY sites and landmarks and Broadway), old NY charm, and close to Penn Station.  Would definitely stay here again.  Gave AAA member discount.;5
We we’re slightly worried about our stay at this hotel due to the mixed reviews, however we had no issues at all and really enjoyed our time at The New Yorker! On arrival the lady who checked us in was really polite and helpful, we had booked a standard queen room with no view but she upgraded us! We had breakfast included and were given coupons for the Tick Tock diner, we had breakfast there 2 mornings and we enjoyed our food. Yes the rooms are small and a little dated but it was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The hotel is in a good location and I would recommend it to anyone travelling to NYC.  Don’t be put off by the negative comments! Thank you for a lovely trip.;4
Great location across from Madison Square Gardens, all staff very friendly, very clean and quiet. Would recommend, we had a blast. Front desk approachable and answered all questions we had. Always felt safe.;5
Me and my partner visited this hotel Dec 2019 was the most perfect holiday and perfect location and hotel was ok! Never had problems when I was there...however, when I arrived on check inn I was told I had to pay $150 which was £121.59 English money for a security deposit (if I broke anything or smoked in the room etc) which I didn’t and on check out I was told the money had been refunded back into my account and I would get it within 5-10 days. Which was fine!! Until it gets to March 2020 and I still haven’t received my money. First I contacted my bank in the middle of January, they told me to contact the hotel so they put me through to the head office at the New Yorker hotels. After being on the phone for 40 minutes and no luck I was told the only way to contact the employees;2
The staff were amazing and when we mentioned it was our anniversary we received a card and a bottle in our room, the staff at breakfast again were very helpful, breakfast was great   Our only complaints are, for the cost of the room we felt the bathroom was small and needs updating, our biggest issue were the pillows, we had lots of them however they were totally flat when you laid on them, they really need to invest in new ones  Overall we enjoyed our stay;5
"This Hotel is extremely over due for a renovation. To be located right on 34th street in NYC this hotel is very old and dirty. The hallway and room smell like a football team lockerroom. The room carpets are not  kept. Found another person hair on the ""clean towels"" and toilet looks like it has't been cleaned in days. But is not actually that is dirty is that it's old and stained and full of splashes from God knows what. This place is very disappointing.  I asked for a room upgrade and I was willing to pay for it. I was advised they have nothing available.";1
beautiful view lovely time, for my first holiday it was the best can't wait for my next holiday and can't wait until I come back, even the flight over was calm and I didn't get 1st class but it was nice and calm even in the busiest day of the year;5
We were visiting this hotel for a 3 night stay prior to going on a cruise. It's very central, right opposite Madison Square Garden and about a 10 minute walk to Times Square.  It's a busy hotel and the check in line was huge at some times of the day, however we were lucky and checked in pretty smoothly. The lifts are also subject to you being there at the right time. I was very pleased with our room and we had everything we needed. We didn't eat at the Tick Tock Diner in the hotel so can't comment on how good it was. I would definitely stay here again.;4
Such an amazing hotel and very staff. The first person to look after us was Mohammad at front desk. He gave us a beautiful room with an amazing view. Thanks Muhammad. Great way to start our first trip to New York;5
For the last 7 or more Yeats, I have stayed a week at the New Yorker for my annual business trip to Manhattan.  This year, the hotel was not nearly as nice as in years past.  For one thing, only three of the six elevators are operational.  It took a very long time just to get in and out of the hotel each time.  They have also taken the coffee makers out of the room and if you want one, it will cost you $25 per day.  Finally, they check in process took a very long time.  The man apologized saying that he was having a hard time finding a room for us.  This was disappointing as I had made the reservations and paid for them a month prior to my arrival, I did the recheck in the night before, and I arrived at the hotel at the time I said I would.;3
This hotel provided excellent accommodations. We visited  and travel often and couldn't have been happier. The hotel was very clean, provided good service and the parking was easy. We will return and recommend.;5
We are currently sat in the lobby, a long wait until our transfer, but felt the need to write our review straight away.  We couldn’t have had a better stay, a quick and very friendly check in, where we were upgraded as it was our honeymoon.  All staff have been lovely. Room kept immaculate, and every question to staff answered with a smile.  Thank you New Yorker, you all really did add to our honeymoon experience, we shall hopefully return;5
My husband & I visited NY at the end of February & stayed at this hotel. It was fantastic! Rooms cleaned daily, staff always helpful & friendly and the lobby always clean & tidy. The hotel is ideally located within walking distance of a lot of tourist attractions such as the Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square & Macy’s. We had a wonderful time at The New Yorker Hotel. Would thoroughly recommend.;5
we recently just come back from the New Yorker. We stayed for 5 nights. The hotel is in a great location. The hotel is good value for money, the rooms are a little old fashioned and could do with up dating but very clean. There are a few things that I would say about the hotel. We had to pay $5 dollars a bag to leave at the hotel before check in and after check out which I think is a little naughty, we should be able to leave our bags at the hotel free of charge for all the money we have paid. Also when we arrived at the hotel they ask for your debit card, this is incase of damages. Now we were not informed of this before hand and also the amount it would be $180 and it was taken out of our account and left us a little short and told it will take 5/6 days to go back into our;3
I stayed here in February for my mums 60th birthday. The hotel was very accommodating and upgraded us to a better room which had views of the empire state building. They also gave us some complimentary bottles of wine and breakfast vouchers as this room was not available the first evening. The hotel staff could not do enough for us and also placed some birthday banners that I brought with me in the room so that my mum had a nice surprise when we returned to the room. This hotel is clean and an excellent location for the different sites. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again if I visited New York again!!;5
We arrived at 1 o clock to be told it would cost to check in early but that she would do it for free ( didn’t really understand this as the room was ready).  All I can say about this hotel is that it’s very average. Good location, however our room was absolutely tiny, run down bathroom, and air con that didn’t work very well.  On check out we had to pay to keep our bags in the hotel whilst we went out for the day- hadnt we paid enough? If I returned to New York would probably pay more to stay somewhere else.  No other issues apart from these;3
We  stayed here for four nights in February  and really enjoyed our visit. Our room was clean with a very comfy bed. Bathroom was clean with a very powerful shower. We were a bit apprehensive because of previous reviews but really had no faults at all. The tick tock diner was very good with friendly staff too. Hotel central for empire state building, central park & times square. We would stay again if we ever return to new york.;5
The location of this hotel is great, but there are lots of hotels in New York that are situated well. The lobby is nice, and there is a 24 hour diner on site. The manager I dealt with, Meghan, was sympathetic and helpful. Unfortunately, that’s all the good points.  There are no tea or coffee facilities in the room( tough if you’ve been travelling for 10 hours) and although there is water, this is chargeable at $5 per bottle. The lifts upto floor 20 are frequent, anything above that, you best be prepared for a wait. If you want to leave your luggage, perhaps because you have a later flight, it’s charged at $5 dollars per bag, per hour, first time I’ve come across that in Manhattan, perhaps we have been lucky.  Late checkout is charged at $50 ( I think that gives you 3 hours on;3
Pros,we stayed at this hotel for 5 nights lovely hotel still has original features which we liked our room was big enough for us and clean hotel staff where pleasant concierge was helpful Cons,only downside they is no kettle in the rooms so you cant make coffee/tea breakfast consists of pastries and coffee and a peice of fruit but if this not enough you can buy breakfast I think other than that they is a McDonald's directly over the road from the hotel & the hotel is quite central to all amenities tube buses tour buses etc;4
It used to be that booking a suite meant a spacious set of rooms on a high floor (38-40) and included a kitchenette, but whern I arrived this February I was given a small set of rooms, without kitchen facilities on the 7th floor, witjh no view at all and barely any natural daylight. I was moved once a better room became available but even then, I had to give up my current room before the new one was available and was told that I would have to move the luggage myself. The staff are generally helpful and the hotel had to cope with a revolving door and half the lifts being out of service. I had booked here for several years in succession prior to this, so overall I like staying there, but now I have to at least conisder alternatives;3
We are just back from 4 nights at The New Yorker.  The location is superb but the hotel leaves a lot to be desired.  The staff were friendly enough but the whole hotel needs gutting, I appreciate it is an art deco style hotel and some features in reception are very charming, but it needs totally refurbishing, our room was clean enough but so so dated and I doubt it's been touched since it was built, it felt very old, dreary and depressing.  The worst thing about the hotel was the lifts, we would wait up to 15 minutes morning and evening for lifts down to reception and then back up to our floor again after a day out!  There were at least 3 lifts out of order with no signs informing anyone of this, the queues of people waiting for lifts in the lobby was ridiculous.  This really;3
POSITIVES FOR A FAMILY OUTWEIGH THE NEGATIVES   Positives  Location!!! - perfect base for exploring NYC  Family Rooms - all 6 of us could stay together in the Family Suite.  Price - unbelievably good price.  We paid around £1550 for 6 nights.  By NYC standards this is a great deal!!  Decent views of NYC  The house keeping staff were very helpful   Negatives  Hotel rooms are very dated and quite noisy (in so much as you can hear every conversation outside your room).  The room and lobby outside the room was scruffy but beds were comfortable and clean.  Rooms are made up every day and staff are nice.  Overall - great value and perfect for a family of 6.  I would stay here again if going with the family.;3
We really enjoyed our stay at the New Yorker hotel and would most definitely stay here again and also recommend this hotel to others. It’s ideally situated for Times Square, Empire State Building, Macy’s and lots of other attractions. The staff was always happy to help especially Mohammed on the front desk who checked us in he was so lovely!  Thank you for a lovely stay to all at the New Yorker Hotel!;5
Me and my son have just returned from a 4 night stay. We were given a room on the 33rd floor with a great view of Madison square gardens. Check in was smooth. We loved the room- yes the bathroom is dated but it’s a 1920s hotel and we liked the fact it still had period features. Tick tock  diner was great ate there for dinner and twice for breakfast. Location wise this hotel is perfect not far from any of the attractions. The only negative was the elevators! Took upwards of 15 minutes in the morning would be full of people and stopping on every floor it was a nightmare. I would definitely come back in the future provided the elevators were fixed Thankyou for an amazing stay 😀;4
We had a comfortable 4 night stay at this perfectly located hotel. Positives : - excellent central location, our room had views of Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden - quick and efficient check in and check out - friendly and caring staff - large, spacious room with 2 very comfortable double beds on floor 35 - small  bathroom with a powerful shower and lots of very hot water - high standard of cleaning - great food at Tick Tock Diner and the adjoining Italian.  Negatives : - waiting for lifts was a real pain. One night there were so many people waiting, a member of staff took groups of guests up in the staff lift  - Towels were clean and regularly replaced but small and not oft - Nowhere to place toiletries in the small bathroom - No kettle but one could be hired;4
"We arrived at the New Yorker after a 3 hour wait to get through immigration.  I would have thought an airport like JFK would have been more organised.  We got a taxi to the hotel ($65 plus tip) and upon arrival we were told that we had been upgraded to a family suite on the 39th floor. We were also told that we had free wifi and free international calls.  There was a facilities fee of $135 which we were told was for things like water/room service etc.  Turns out the facilities fee was for the ""free"" wifi and we felt completely ripped off and we were charged $92 dollars for this privilege of using this.  Our upgraded ""suite"" turned out to be nothing more than a run down bedsit with a double bed and a dirty looking sofa bed.  We declined the offer of the upgrade and asked for the";3
Just home from a fabulous 4 day weekend in NYC. Had read lots of reviews leading up to our visit so was cautious. We travelled with two teenagers. Mohamed check us in on arrival who was very helpful and when I queried the upgrade request he then changed our room.   Room one 2055 - rooms in the city are historically small this was tiny, cold, drafts through the windows , dusty and the bathroom was had hairs in the bath & was dirty. I went straight to reception and saw another helpful lady (no name sorry). This lady was very helpful and apologised profusely, not her thought of course. She kindly offered a room update and x4 free breakfast voucher for Tick Tock for the following day which was perfect. The bathroom was cleaned immediately. 3624 was a larger room, with amazing views;4
This hotel is situated very close to the Empire State Building and everywhere is very accessible. The rooms are a reasonable size and if you want more space there is the option to upgrade. The staff were all helpful and friendly and everywhere was clean. Sometimes the lifts got very busy at peak times. I was sad that they don’t cater for gluten free and as a coeliac it was like going back in time to how the UK used to be! We were given breakfast vouchers which were no use to myself or my daughter because there was no pastries that were gluten free. We tried the restaurant one day as my daughter is vegan and again we really struggled. She lived on salad and chips and the breakfast I had was slapped onto the plate! It cost about £25! The hotel has 80 floors and the view across the;3
We were very lucky. Family traveling with 2 adult teen kids. We booked a suite with 1 bed and a pull out couch. We called to add a rollaway. They told us to ask when we check in if they have a upgrade available and we did just that. We were upgraded to a family suite with 2 double beds and a pull out couch. Even better TWO BATHROOMS and a terrace!  It truly is a great hotel as far as convenience is concerned. Subway right outside. MSG across the street. The Tick Tock diner!   We love staying here!!;5
My wife and I stayed here whilst staying in New York and it was a great location or our visit with only a couple of issues. 1 was the fact that only half of the elevators were in operation although we did receive a letter with an apology, although we felt it could have been sorted before with regards to the hotel being full due to the dog show at Madison square gardens and a lot of people staying here also with dogs. 2 we had a blocked toilet 1 day and I phoned for this to be resolved about 10.30 am and when we returned at 6.45 pm it still hadn't been sorted and we both had to have showers as we were going out to see the Eagles at 7.30 and there was a smell plus poo in the toilet, and somebody had picked up our clean the room sign and turned it over to say do not disturb but;4
We were very pleased with this hotel. Travelled with family including 3 teenagers and we were all pleased with the New Yorker hotel. It’s very conveniently situated, very reasonably priced and has some great restaurants. The Tick Tock diner is great for breakfast and the Italian Trattoria is great for dinner. As it’s been written on here previously, getting in a lift in the morning can be a pain. Our double family room was very spacious and included a walk-in closet which was handy. The bathrooms seem to be original design, but we felt that added to the charm of the place. We would definitely book this hotel if visiting New York again.;5
I have stayed at the New Yorker about 5 times now. I like the hotel but even with NYC standards, the rooms are pretty small. The housekeeping staff was top notch and they kept everything very clean and were prompt when we needed extra towels. We would have liked to have a coffee maker or Keurig in the room. The location is great and fine if you don’t mind the hustle and bustle of the city. I would stay here again.;4
We recently stayed at The New Yorker for 5 nights and found it to be clean and comfortable. The location is great for MSG, Times Square, Penn Station and Empire State. There are plenty of places to eat near the hotel at a reasonable price. The hotel is approximately a 10 minute walk to Times Square and Broadway. In the morning the hotel has a take out breakfast stand which is very popular, although we didn’t eat here so can’t comment on the quality or price but, the queues spoke for themselves. The only issue is with the lifts in the hotel. They take a very long time to arrive and often when they do arrive they’re too full to even try to squeeze into, resulting in a further wait. One day, some of our party, who were staying on the 28th floor, waited 15 minutes for a lift to;4
Booked 4 nights in new yorke, as it 1st visit to usa I was a bit apprehensive. When checking in was informed we had been upgraded to bigger room. 2 rooms with a balcony/sun deck. View was fantastic. Service from everyone from cleaning lady to front desk was top class. Would I stay here again? In a heartbeat yes I would. Location is so central to everything from Macys to time square  Great hotel cant thank you enough for my time there.;5
"On arrival at the hotel, the grand foyer is lovely, unfortunately the check-in was not particularly friendly. Arriving at approx 1.30am, we were dealt with in a curt manner and no friendliness from the man. Rooms are very small and certainly not the photo that was shown in the Virgin Holidays images. As the room was just to sleep, we did not bother asking for a better room and one that had a view of a wall; this was despite emailing the hotel in advance and asking a question re cabs and asking for a room with a view - no response was received. The elevator situation is main issue with the hotel - we were on floor 22 and were not able to get one any morning. We chose to walk the 22 flights down but many people stood waiting for over 15 minutes and then gave up, returning to their";3
Just returned from a 4 night stay here. After reading some horror stories I was a bit scared to check in. However, it was fine and I needn’t have worried. Yes, it’s dated and yes the rooms are tiny but we didn’t care about those things. It was literally a place to get our heads down after a busy day. We were barely there and it did the job. The location was absolutely spot on. Right opposite madison square garden and a 10 min walk (if that) from Times Square. We couldn’t have been more pleased with the location. It’s also a 2 minute walk from somewhere that does THE NICEST bagel. It’s called ‘best bagel and coffee’. It was so nice we visited more than once. I was worrying about charges on check in as well but as we booked through virgin our tax and fees were included, phew! We;4
After travelling for 24 hours with my family including 2 children. When we arrived at hotel we were told they didn’t have the room we booked available and that they could put us in a room with 1 bed and 2 roll up beds. We didn’t have much choice as it was 10pm. As we went into the room there was literally no space to put the roll up beds (if we could have put beds up it would have 100% blocked the door- causing a fire risk) I went back down to reception to explain there is no room to put up the beds. The hotel staff did not show any empathy and stood in silence shrugging their shoulders. Eventually they found us another room for the night but still roll up beds for the kids. As an apology the staff offered us not to pay the service charge for our stay.  We were told to check out;1
OK, we picked it for convenience, since it is located right next to Madison Square Garden, (where we had tickets to see The Eagles in concert Feb 18 !!!!).......and Penn Station ! Turns out, it is a really super cool old hotel, built during the depression, opened Feb 2:d 1930, with about 2,500 rooms........ - The biggest hotel in NY, at the time !  Nicola Tesla ( lived in room 3327 for 10 years....... - If you do not know about Mr Tesla, please educate yourself.....”death ray”..........-Google, anybody ?) - There is an exhibit of the early years in the lobby downstairs, that you must not miss ! It is still a grand building, after being closed and renovated for 20 some years, to be reopened in 1994, with 1,050 renovated, but vintage, rooms, and we were lucky to get a room on the;5
Fab hotel, very central no problems whatsoever  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in New Yorker was for 5 nights. Came out hotel turn right then left at crossing and Empire State Building was right on front of you.;5
Good value for money. Very spacious room with 2 double and comfy beds. Clean. Size of hotel made it seem a bit impersonal and although efficient, staff we encountered were not warm or friendly. Waiting for lifts wasn’t too much of an issue for use despite being up very high. I would probably stay again because of value for money but would have lower expectations of staff.;3
The Parker New York is ideally situated 2 blocks back from Central Park, down the street from Carnegie Hall. The staff are friendly and helpful, especially Michael Roman on reception. The hotel is clean, the rooms are clean, well kept and if a good size for NYC. The burger bar looks off putting but the food is great. The views from a high floor park view are stunning both day and night. I can’t fault this hotel in any way.;5
My daughter and I were staying four days in this hotel. We enjoyed the location and the hotel staff was mostly nice. We enjoyed the beds and pillows the were amazing. Our room was cleaned daily and the staff were very nice when asked for extra towels ect... I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to New York City 😁😁. The only complaint I have is the evelators are horrible, you always have to wait on them ,also we were stick on our floor waiting on a elevator for like 40 minutes or more,being so far up I cannot go on the stair. Overall we had a pleasant stay. Love the doorman they were so sweet and went out of their way to help.;4
"The hotel is super convenient; about a block from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  The room was a little small, but very clean and comfortable.    The only complaint would be the lack of working elevators.  We were on the 26th floor.  It appeared that most guests were on the upper floors.  Even though there were a bank of elevators that went to 20th - 40th floors, only a few were working.  In the mornings all elevators were packed.  Supposedly only 10 people can get on or it will get stuck.  We ended up using the staff elevators to get down to the lobby.";4
I proceeded to book this hotel having seen many positive reviews, and giving it the benefit of the doubt.   During our stay the Westminster Kennel Club dog show meant that the hotel was packed full of dogs - whilst that was no problem for us, it might have been somewhat different with allergies.   The hotel lobby gives an impression of the grandeur that once was - unfortunately, the luxury ends there.   As mentioned in other reviews, the lift situation is awful - although they are supposed to be replaced next month, we found we needed to leave an extra ten minutes when we left our room to ensure we weren’t late. Only two of the eight lifts for the hotel floors were operational during our stay.   The room itself was fine but extremely dated - this is particularly noticeable in;2
First time in NYC,have to say hotel was ideal for us,a bit old but room was kept spotless every day by the cleaners,the location was excellent with MSG just across the road and Times Square a 10 minute walk away,staff were friendly and very helpful,hotel was reasonably priced also,what more would you want?will be back again👍🏻😀😀;5
Offered room upgrade by email  with pictures of newly renovated ,city view ,larger room with two queen beds . Arrived received dark dingy small room with double beds and a view of the alley. When I complained to manager he said they had no queen sized beds in the hotel only double or kings and the upgrade we were offered didn’t exist. We could barely fit the dog kennel (there for Westminster) between the beds.  By decor hadn’t been renovated since the seventies.;2
My husband and I celebrated our belated honeymoon over Christmas in NYC. This was our first visit to the city and we had a great time at the hotel.  We got a great (paid) upgrade to a suite - which included a sitting area, fridge (useful for self catered room dining and drinks) and a beautiful balcony with a wonderful view. There was also a coffee machine which came in handy in the morning!   We found all staff very helpful and obliging, especially Afroza, Samira, and Mohammed. We didn't eat in the restaurants unfortunately, but the diner had quick service.   Re the lifts - there can be a wait (what do you expect with so many floors?!) but we never experienced any wait of more than 5 minutes.  Re the decor - yes it's a bit dated but this really didn't bother me. I liked the art;5
This is my 2nd visit and my last. The hotel is dated and no work has been done on it since my last visit 5 years ago. There is a 15 minute wait to even use the elevators. The room was cold and really dated. Staff at reception were not the friendliest. The shower had 2 settings scalding hot or cold. They need to invest more money in this hotel or reduce prices to stay there. Only positive was the location which was the only reason I went back but I will find a different hotel next time.  They also charge you to store your bags for 1hr.;1
"We had been offered an online $20 ""upgrade"" to an executive room and accepted it. The wait at the check-in desk was longer than it should have been, but the clerk was courteous and efficient and we were pleased with our upgrade. Our room was larger than average, L-shaped  with windows on two sides. Room was clean and beds quite comfortable. The bathroom was barely big enough for one person to occupy it. Despite our efforts to prevent it, the shower leaked onto the bathroom floor. Only about half of the elevators were operational but we understand that they are being replaced soon. The revolving door was on the fritz, too, so staff had to man the doors to the vestibule.... and we got a wind tunnel trip every time! We were there for the Westminster show (without a dog) but it";4
This is a  great place to stay to visit Manhattan.  The location is handy for the subway.  Rooms are very clean.  Staff helpful.  A bargain compared to other hotels we priced.  We will stay there the next time we visit New York.;5
I recently stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and would never stay there again due to the standard of the bedrooms and the situation of the hotel. The rooms are very very dated and seem as if they have not been updated since the 1980’s. The corridors are very shabby. The area in which the hotel is situated is run down and not an area you want to be walking around on your own at night time. The positives about the hotel are the staff, every member of staff was helpful, friendly and went out of their way to assist you. This is definitely not a 4 star hotel.;1
The hotel was situated right on 34th and 8th street brilliant location , easy access to all the shops and underground transport , we were so excited when we arrived the outside looked amazing so did the reception,  look can be deceiving tho it was a total let down  ,15 mins waiting for a lift as only 2 lifts working out of 6 which are always full , once you get off the lift your opinion will change , the hotel is out dated , we booked a queen room with extra breakfast , the room was small and cold , no rads in the room only a heater on the ceiling , lithe heater would dry your throat out so ud have to put on the cold to cool down the room as there are no windows working ,the bath had brown stains on it and the outside had black mould on the edges other then that the room was;2
"I returned yesterday from a break with my daughter and mother and unfortunately stayed here. At the front door they have 2 security guards, one on an external door and one on an internal door, with a space in the middle.  They have a system with people queuing to get in/out. There was a revolving door, but of course that was out of order. The lady at check in was impersonal to the point of rudeness.  She typed stuff into the computer and said, ""credit card"". I asked how much security was to be taken and she said 4 nights, $140.  I felt as though I shouldn't have asked her. We waited for around 15 mins for an escalator as only half worked. They said they are due to refurbish them sometime never. We were in one room, two queen sized beds.  I know New York rooms are small but this";1
This is one of the most affordable hotels located adjacent to MSG and near Times Square and the Empire State Building. The single rooms are quite tiny, so if you're traveling as a family, I would upgrade to a double room. Given its location to tourist hot-spots, expect a lot of crowds. The lobby and restaurants are packed at all hours of the day. The service is average, but all things considered it is worth experiencing the historic hotel.;3
The New Yorker has a fabulous location in midtown close to the subway and a great number of the ‘must see’ NYC sights. It’s architecturally stunning and the Trattoria Bianca bar and Tick Tock restaurant have great ambience and are reasonably priced.  However we had two real issues with our 4 night stay last week. First was that due to the hotel being full, the room I had booked and paid for was ‘not available’. Despite my protestations we had to settle for a room with no view at all. The second was that the concierge tried to charge me $130 for tickets to a game at the Garden that I actually paid only $54 at MSG box office! So unfortunately I have to advise that if you choose to stay at the New Yorker, don’t think you will necessarily get the room you actually booked and paid;3
Whenever we stay in NYC, we try to choose a hotel with an interesting history.  The New Yorker has it, and we really enjoyed our stay. We were there to see the Westminster Kennel Club dog show, and seeing all of the dogs staying at our hotel was a great bonus!  The staff was very friendly and the room was wonderfully clean. Extra points for the gorgeous art deco ceiling light!  We'll definitely stay here again.;5
We stayed during NYFW, it was super busy in the hotel.  The staff was excellent, and treated everyone with respect.  We had a few questions, and they were answered very nicely. We did Valet park our Chevy Traverse which cost us 70.00. It was easy to do, and took that city parking stress away from our trip which we loved!! (Retrieving the vehicle at the end was super smooth as well)  There was a dog show in the hotel, so there were dogs everywhere.  I do have an allergy to them, but it never seemed to bother me.  Our double bed room was super clean, the bathroom was small, but had the antique faucets and door knobs, that took you back in time.  The view out of our window was of the Empire State building , I sat for hours looking at it during the night.  There was noise from the;5
Excellent staff, well appointed rooms, good services, and a location that can't be beat.  I used to stay at another hotel in the area.  However, in two visits to The New Yorker I am now converted.  Great place.;4
This year was a bit more pleasant on check-in and waiting time except the room was not ready at 3PM.  Waited 1/1/2 hours to access it.  Otherwise love the Tick-Tock dinner and the Italian restaurant in-house.  Room was clean and comfortable as well as quiet.  They did have elevator problems with long waits, but a letter of apology was distributed. Also the revolving door was not working for the majority of time I was there.  There was extra staff working the manual doors that helped the situation--this also provided extra eyes for security.;5
Beautfull Art Deco style hotel excellently positioned on 8th Avenue near Penn Station. Easy walking distance to most of the NYC sights. Rockerfella, Empire State, Radio City Music Hall and lots more. Negative. 3 out of 5 elevators not working and queues building owing to high demand on working elevators. 3 attempts to activate a working key. 2 double beds squeezed into a small corner room.;3
The hotel was a great place for us to get to from Penn Station.  We felt very safe being on a girls trips.  The restaurant in the hotel was convenient and good.  It was easy to get on the subway to go anywhere.;5
Love The New Yorker Hotel and especially their Staff. The employees are Old School with Great Manners. They open the Door for you like a Gentlemen should Open the Door for you. Customer Service is Phenomenal. Its my fourth time staying here and I'll be back again next year.;5
Thanks a lot to Mohamed on customer service we managed to upgrade our room to the suite, which what we wanted. The suite had two bathrooms as well as two rooms. The downside was the bedroom was a corner room and had windows overlooking two sides of the street hence this maximised amount of noise from the sirens at night (but i suppose it being NY this is expected). ALso, the bathroom had a bit droughty window and the sink did not drain very well. The air conditioner was working ok until one night it stopped and became very cold in the room (we managed to switch it back on alright). Otherwise, the beds were extremelly comfortable - the best beds i've ever slept in. ALso, the hotel is located in the centre of what we wanted to do as it was very close to the undeground station and;3
My stay here was Phenomenal it was about a 5ish to 10 minute walk to broadway and everything i needed to do for my business stay was right there in walking distance from the hotel. The staff were EXTREMELY helpful and made any accommodations i would have needed. The managers were always there with their staff and ill Definitely stay here again maybe on my family trip to new york. But home sweet home it is;5
Where to start:   We had booked via an agent who booked us into a standard double , this can only be described as a student accommodation. So small , tired carpets and room wasn’t cleaned properly.  Becareful what rooms you book here !!   We asked to move rooms which we had to pay for an “upgrade “ additional price per night we had no choice as the original room was disgraceful.   The hotel is so very very busy !! There was an issue with the lifts so the wait time was considerable to cope with the many many visitors and this was quiet season. We had a letter saying there is an upgrade due in March on the lifts. No compensation was made for this .   The place is in need of a refurb.   An issue with the revolving front doors meant you had to queue in the wind and rain to enter the;2
We have been going to the New Yorker regularly over the past 15 years at the same time of year--Westminster Dog Show/Valentine's Day. We booked through a shady site--otel.com--and were a little worried something would go wrong with the reservation after reading their reviews. [I believe] since i called the hotel directly a week in advance of the reservation to confirm, all went well. Mohammed, who checked us in, was very helpful and knowledgeable. We got the room type we reserved and it was nice. However, this time, there was NO refrigerator or coffee maker. Very inconvenient but available at a surcharge of, from what I'm told, was around $40/stay. There were major problems with the entrance doors, being worked on. HUGE wind tunnel going in and out. Don't bother doing your hair;3
great location - tiny room-s tick tock restuarant  poor food and cold to table---lobby very busy and small  --not enough desk staff---  but very  easy acess to subways and times square--and shopping and good places to eat;3
Took level 24. Premier suite. The Internet and TV signal were a bit hit and miss. No grab rail in shower cubicle. NOT SAFE. The loose cushions on the chairs were rather B.O.smelly and need cleaning.  The food was very good. The hotel was very clean. The entertainment was okay, well done Pepe for his music. Outside entertainers were good. The staff are fab, nothing too much trouble. The reception was OK. Tui reps were super and followed everything through. The hotel needs a refurb. This doesn't mean that it spoilt our stay, but it will be a bonus.  Not wanting to be snooty but I object to paying extra 2 euros for premium drinks downstairs when we have paid More for our holiday than the 22 other floors. This is not acceptable. Would like a response to that from the HOTEL MANAGER;4
The Wyndham New Yorker is my go to hotel when visiting NYC.  Love the location,being near Penn Station, walking distance to Broadway Shows, but not in Times Square.  Catching the subway is right there, since I visit son in Brooklyn often.  All staff are very friendly and accommodating.;5
Just returned from a 3 night stay here. Very quick and easy check in. Rooms are very small.  The shower is ok We only slept in the room so it was ok  The lifts are slow but we were informed that they are spending 8 million dollars on an upgrade. Grab & go breakfast is great to get you started for the day.  The lobby was always busy. The staff are very friendly and helpful  We liked the idea that you were checked for your room card before using the lift as security  The location is excellent for seeing all of the sights See you again;4
Arrived with very friendly reception staff, went to room 2715 which was so small, no view, brown and dark decor dusty and mould in the bath. So disappointed! We got moved to 2818 which was better. Shame the furniture is brown and dated, really needs to be modernised. Still no view but apparently a metro queen view room is what I have (a wall). Bed comfy. The lifts are always slow, I don't think they all work at one time. One guy said he was waiting 20 min for the lift thd other day, when it did arrive we went from floor 28 to 1 to 30 then every floor down! It was so hot and busy. The hotel is very dated, the hall ways are old fashioned, very noisy outside which you can hear all night. Very surprised you don't even get tea or coffee facilities in the room. I personally won't stay;3
This hotel is worthwhile for the location alone. Its a block away from MSG and walking distance from Times Square and Broadway. That being said, the hotel itself isn’t great. The lobby is cramped and always busy. The rooms are kinda cramped and not the cleanest. I actually had to change rooms because the shower pipes were rusted and released dirty brown water. The wifi wasn’t strong. The hotel also has guards that you need to show your room card to in order to go in and out. The whole operation seems to be 20 years behind more modern hotels. But, if you don’t plan to spend much time in your hotel, this is a pretty affordable Midtown hotel.;3
Wyndham New Yorker.  Clean and cozy room. Staff was awesome and the tic tick good food.  Lovely lobby to sit and people watch.  Close to everything to do in the city.  The doorman had taxis ready and available at all times.;4
This was my 2nd stay at the New Yorker within 12 months. My first visit was fairly pleasant in December 2018, I was checked in by the manager at the time, who without asking reduced the facilities fee to $15 per night, as I was staying for 7+ nights which was a very well received gesture, however, the room I stayed in was not up to standard. Cold with an unreliable shower, dirty carpet and unpredictable aircon/heating but as this was my first visit didn't think much of it as I spent little time in the hotel.   My second trip as of last week (Jan-Feb 2020) unfortunately will be my last. I cannot fault the lady who checked me and my partner in as she was incredible with top notch customer service, went out of her way to check us into a room on the 36th floor, with a view of;2
"Pros: Located in the perfect spot for experiencing and getting to everything you could possibly want in Manhattan! Penn Station at the corner, the iconic Tick Tock Diner in the lobby, Madison Square Garden across the street, short walk to Times Square, theater district and Macy's, short walk to Port Authority. Also friendly staff and the ""idea"" of staying in a landmark building.  Cons: tiny rooms (I mean TINY), old building with older rooms, loud noises and booming sounds throughout the night and early morning.";4
Facility charges don't make sense, feels like a tricky way to up room price and not clear during shopping for a hotel room. Be prepared to pay more as you check in / out. Love the location yet the room didn't have much room to move very small it looked bigger online when I made the reservations.;3
Stayed (1) night to attend a tradeshow at Javits Convention Center. It was a superb experience! I arrived at the hotel before 12:00pm, thinking I could use the bag drop until check-in at 4:00pm. To my surprise, the reception staff checked me into my room early so that I get to the show. The ladies I spoke with were both attentive and welcoming. As an older hotel, the decor and accents seem dated and tired to some. I think it adds an air of nostalgia to the days of old NYC. My room was clean and comfortable. That's what I really care about! I dined at Trattoria and Tick Tock. Great service, friendly staff, as well. It's located a few blocks from Empire State, Madison Square Garden, Macy's, etc.;5
Gave us a great experience in NYC.  Wonderful staff, great facilty, everything you need was there with a reasonably priced room.  Proximity to the Intrepid, Empire State building, Broadway and Time Square was great.;5
Dirty and stained sofa cushions, old furnishings, property really needs an update.  The people at check-in were helpful, but that can't make up for the need for clean new furniture.  The food at the diner is horrible.;2
"On check in we were charged $5000 ""accidentally"" which essentially left us penniless whilst in New York. We complained to the service manager who kindly agreed to waive our resort fee. 3 days after check out this was recharged to one of our two rooms despite this verbal agreement. Her response was to deny that this was even tabled. Our family holiday will be forever tarnished with bad feelings, solely at the responsibility of Wyndham New Yorker.  The occurrence of  initial error, the behaviour of the staff member who addressed our initial concerns, the avoidance of our complaint when lodged via email and finally the deceptive way in which you applied charges well after our check- out is the reason for this.   Clearly meeting your customers basic expectations is not a priority.";1
The staff where every welcoming and helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble for them.  I had an issue with the safe twice and both times they fixed it straight away.  The room was cold when I came back from a days sightseeing, but just but the heater on and within ten minutes it was lovely and warm.  The only down side was that they had painted the tiles and bath and the paint was chipping off so was not able to have a bath.  The shower pressure was a bit much too but could cope for the amount of time there.  The only thing that was missing from the room was a coffee maker or kettle that would have been nice.  Everything was provided.  It was very central.  Time square about a 10 min walk and Macy’s was about a block away and also old navy.  There was a 7/11 just around corner;4
My travel agency recommended me this hotel to spend 7 days, everything went well, excellent price! until the exit happens! we stayed on the 20th Floor, and at check out they presented a bill of 270 dollars because there was a little ash in the window on the inside on the 20th floor, with a wind from the other world! the evidence they gave me was these attached photos. cheap is really expensive! escape from this hotel, at the reception everything is noted, in order to deceive the tourist. we sent for someone responsible, and a normal counter employee came, who did nothing but say that he offered to keep his bags! (pay if 5 for each bag). after 5 minutes, he said that after all we had to pay to keep it. a person in charge came who was watching everything but pretended (Kader;1
"Amazing room with a city view as promised by the brilliant Mohammed on the front desk. He promised us the best room in his house and he delivered! He called up to our room once we were settled to ensure we were happy. Beautiful old building with stunning decoration and beautiful old lifts. The staff were all very friendly. The room was very comfortable including a very lovely bed and squishy pillows. We were a bit dubious about the coffee machine and getting extra pods ( for tea and coffee - caf and decaf) but they provided more each day. We watched the New York sky - sunrise and sunset over where we had incredible views of the financial district - including the new world trade centre. Fantastic - really made it a trip of a lifetime and being the first to NY for one of us; it";5
In the heart of tourist area which is very convenient.  Lovely big rooms. Would be nice to have a kitchenette to make it perfect!  Check in staff were very efficient despite there being lots of people checking in at the same time.;4
"The hotel is pretty tired. We upgraded our room from the last time we stayed, and the room was the exact same tiny size, with a ""view"". The tub really needed refinishing. The elevators were very slow, with only a few of them working. There is no gift shop, so buying a soda after the lobby kiosk closes is not possible. The staff were mostly pleasant, but our booking was difficult to achieve, as it was a bit complex.";3
When checking-in there was a problem with our booking....it appeared they had not received confirmation from our travel agent....this took a while to sort out but they were apologetic and to be fair, it was not their fault. Eventually sorted and we were very pleased with our room. Hotel is in a great location for all the attractions and a great breakfast is served in diner at hotel. They charge you 5 dollars for each bag you want stored as you cannot have room key until 4pm.;4
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The rooms were clean, spacious and the bed was comfortable. Our view from the window wasn't the greatest but we didn't really spend any time in our room for that to matter. The grand entrance with 1920s design was beautiful. I love this style and it was just a great atmosphere to be in.;4
The staff at The New Yorker was truly wonderful. They were so accommodating & demonstrated the best customer service. I would stay here again & again just based on the staff alone. The views were fabulous as well. The location was perfect. This was my first stay and I will be back for sure.;5
Hotel was great. We enjoyed the historical exhibit that celebrated the hotel's 90th anniversary. The only problem we had was the incredibly loud noise coming from a construction project on the corner of 34th St. and 8th Ave. Although we were on an upper floor, we could still hear the sounds of cutting and drilling. The city shouldn't allow these construction projects to go on so late at night.;4
Not knowing much about where anything was in NYC we reserved through the wyndham rewards website.  Drove in from Boston along the Hudson, turned up W34th for 3 blocks, parked our SUV under, and walked a few steps to the front door.  The grandeur of the hotel was remarkable.  Built in the 30's with a lot of history inside.  The 24hr Tick Tock diner was wonderful and the steak house downstairs had you dine inside a bank vault.  Minutes from the empire state building, penn station, time square, and the intrepid.  Food selections everywhere.  it is the place to stay while you visit the big city.;5
Firstly we arrived at JFK and decided to get a yellow cab to the hotel. This cost around $78. It took over an hour. In hindsight we may have travelled to La Guardia as its closer. We were lucky when we arrived at the hotel. There was no queue to check in. I did see long check in queues on other days. We paid extra for upgraded rooms. We also got lucky with our room. It was a disability accessible room. We had ample space and the bathroom was big. The beds are awful...too soft for our taste. The rooms were cleaned to a good standard daily. Location excellent....in the middle of everything. Nothing was too far away. Because of the location it is very noisy at night. This never bothered us...we were tired from all the sight seeing during the day and had no trouble falling asleep.;5
After having recieved the confirmation email which repeatedly stated that I had paid in full I arrived at the hotel to discover in the small print of the email was a hidden additional cost of over $30 per night. This fee covered the costs of what the initial booking had detailed as being included items for example the WiFi.   Thanks for the great welcome to NYC;1
After swearing the place off for a few years, I decided to give it another try.  The service was much better. The rooms are small, but if you just need a convenient and comfortable place for a couple days it's fine.   I had booked the hotel through a travel site and paid in advance - I like to have the room charges and taxes out of the way before any of my trips. I arrived a couple hours early and the hotel offered to hold my bags or I could pay a $50 fee and they'd put me in a room early.  I've not seen hat option in a long time. I decided to pay the fee and drop my bags in a room as I had places to go and things to do.   The morning of my departure a paper bill had been slipped under the door. I expected the $50 plus tax for the early check in I did not expect an additional;3
The room was small.  Put out the do not disturb sign and hung up our towels.  When we got back sheets and towels were changed.  Why bother to post signs about being eco friendly when your staff doesn’t bother to pay attention?;3
Stayed here January 2020. Mohammed at the desk was very friendly and checked us in early and upgraded our room to one with a view of Madison Square Garden. Room was pleasant. It's a few years past its prime but the price and location make up for that. Never actually had to deal with the front desk but the security personnel that checked our room key for access to elevators were always pleasant. They will hold bags for a $5/bag charge. The location here is great-very close to Penn Station and MSG. The Tik Tock diner can be accessed through the hotel lobby also. Had a minor elevator issue our first day (door wouldn't fully close/operate) but it was resolved quickly. (The elevators are divided with the upper floors being serviced by a separate bank of elevators.) All in all, a;4
We stayed for a 8 nights in room 2138 and had a view towards the Empire State Building. Penn station was just across the cross road and Madison Square Garden's main entrance just a couple of blocks away. So was Macy's and many other shops, restaurants & diners and an AMC's movie theather.  Subways A, C, E, 1, 2 and 3 have stations next to the hotel and trains run from Penn station. Very simple to reach from the JFK for example (via Jamaica). Taxis can be found in front of the hotel with a help of the hotel's doorman.  We had our breakfast where ever so no experience of the hotel's breakfast. Nor did we use the business center or gym even the facility fee was obligatory addition to the accommodation fee.  Hotel has nice lobby, we had nice service at the desk when arriving and;4
Everyone was extremely nice, rooms were pleasant. Overall great experience. The person who checked us with a smile and was very friendly. I thought he was very like able. Asked is where we were getting getting and informed us of a few good place to go to. Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to visiting again.;5
Got a great deal on a couple of nights in January so I stayed here again. I love the location and the I love the hotel. It's true that some of the rooms are bit small and some of the fittings in the bathroom are long in the tooth, but it's comfortable. It's a bit noisy but hey that's New York.;5
Would be hard to beat in terms of location being right beside Penn Station giving easy access to everywhere near and around Times Square. Decent sized clean rooms too and efficient check in with friendly staff. There is a safe and hairdryers in rooms but not coffee machine or kettle although there are coffee facilities in lobby and a Starbucks directly opposite. We tried the Tick Tock diner attached but weren’t impressed with the food here sorry.;4
Stayed in a room with 2 queen size beds which were comfortable and the room was fine. The shower however had terrible water pressure which let the bathroom down. The staff were friendly and the hotel is in a great location close to Times Square, the Empire State, Madison Square Garden and shopping with a train station and subway next to it. The attached Tick Tock diner was very good also.  Unfortunatley there is a compulsory facilities charge which covers use of the business centre, fitness centre and telephone calls....none of which we needed or wanted to use but had to pay for anyway and thats what would put me off staying here again despite the hotel being good overall.;4
We were very pleased with the New Yorker hotel. It was very clean, staff were friendly and helpful and the location was perfect for our list of sites to see. Penn Station located next door allowed for easy subway access. Tik Tok restaurant open 24 hours was really good upon late night returns.;5
Stayed for 6 nights and got a upgrade to a room with 2 beds which was a great size. Rooms are art deco style with 2 separate robes. Shower was very powerful and relaxing after walking all day. Lots of lifts so no waiting around and security was good too. Location is great for everything. Only thing I would change is to have tea/coffee facilities but would definitely return 😁.;5
Great location. Tired rooms that need major updates to be clean. Old carpet, old decor, sagging mattresses. This was probably a gem in its heyday that is now in need of complete redecorating and overhaul of hvac etc.;3
Great location for 5 nights but first impression was not a nice area to be in.  Easy walk to theatres and time square and Empire State Building   Recommend a hop on hop off bus tour to get orientated.  Didn’t realise you had to ask for a fridge in room until we were unpacked and can’t even make a cup of tea. Bed was very comfortable. The kicker was $5 per bag to store when checking out and the resort fees per day for nothing!! What a rip!!!;3
Great location. That’s about it really. Hotel upgraded us to a city view room, unfortunately between dirt and broken seals around windows the view was disappointing.  Found medication packaging behind  bin in room, a mans sock at side of bed, skirting boards window sills filthy. Sheets not ironed, curtains looked filthy. Bathroom so basic and tile ridges filthy, overall a very poor standard. Then hit with a $30 per night  tax $120 and $5 per case $25 to store luggage after checkout. Bed, toilet and bath where clean and after being travelling for  20 hours we  where just glad to get our heads down. Reception said we should of informed them on arrival, think their missing the point the room should  be cleaned properly at all times. When leaving the lift (certainly where room 3322);1
This hotel is in a great location to downtown attractions, walking distance from Time Square and Broadway.  Hotel was beautiful and the rooms were a little on the small side but comfortable.  Great views of the city and it was quite and safe. There was a rather long line a check in and we had small issues with Guest Services but all were handled quickly to our satisfaction.  I truly feel like we got the best bang for our buck and would recommend this hotel to anyone.;4
Stayed in the New Yorker for a week as my mums 60th birthday gift. The hotel, when hearing it was my mums birthday, upgraded us to a city view room, free of charge. The hotel itself is very central to all attractions, yet not right in the hustle and bustle of Times Square. The diner attached to the hotel is open 24/7 and has the best cheesecake. I particularly loved the fact that you have to show your room key to enter the elevator, I felt it was a very safe hotel. The rooms, staff & hotel are amazing, this is my 2nd visit to the New Yorker & I will definitely stay again on my next visit.;5
The hotel best selling point is its location. 1 block from Macy's, across the street from MSG and a 15 minute walk to Empire state building.  We had no issues with the staff, they were always polite. We were offered an upgrade and negotiated a better deal for the 8 nights we stayed.  Our room was on 31st floor.  it was a good size, had room and even a fridge. The view of the empire state building was fab. The bathroom.. it definitely needs a makeover it was dated and not great.    The biggest issue is their facility/resort fees of $31 a day. its a complete and utter rip off. How the state is allowing hotels to charge these fees is beyond me. For the fee you get use of the business centre, gym and their 'free' wifi .... Shocking!;4
This hotel was dirty, outdated and overpriced.  Buyer beware, upon arrival I had to pay an addition $40 facility fee I was not aware of.  The staff was not in the least concerned with my concerns. I would not recommend!;1
We just checked in and have been really happy with our experience.  Mohammed at the front desk in particular was spectacular in helping us get checked in, and was super kind and caring despite the long lines - very professional and helpful.  Even called the room to check on us - WOW.  We are now enjoying our nice, clean room - so roomy compared to so many boutique hotels around here.  And beds seem really comfy, and good soundproofing.  We also visit the Tik Tok diner downstairs frequently (more than for just this stay) and the food is always fresh and good.  Thumbs up!;5
Lovley Hotel but customer service is terrible. Have contacted this hotel numerous times about something that was left in the room and have yet to get a reply. Have done email, Facebook, messenger and haven't the courtesy to contact me back.;2
We stayed 4 nights recently! Room is basic but it’s all ya need it’s very clean and central to many attractions :) hairdryer is good also! staff are so nice and helpful. I would stay again! Only thing is 4/6 lifts to the 20th floor weren’t working so everyone who was on the first 19 floors had to wait for two lifts which were crowded so if they were fixed would be so much easier! But great stay.;5
Fantastic hotel great location, nice clean rooms and comfortable , rooms cleaned everyday , hotel staff very polite and friendly ..tick tock diner underneath hotel was a bonus ...food was ok in there and waiters were friendly, only down side too it is there is a $10 minimum charge so if you only want a coffee in there it ends up been expensive  ...would recommend new yorker hotel ....;5
Great location opposite the BEST Cantina. Massive place but higher floors have less rooms, quieter. Great facilities in room (internet/tv/cable). Comfortable beds and a great view of downtown from the 39th floor.;5
We spent ten nights here over Christmas and got a free upgraded room due to our length of stay.   The room was spacious and neat. We had a great view of Madison Square and the Empire State from the window.   The bathroom was again spacious and included both shower and bath. There was a walk in wardrobe and basic amenities.   Only gripe I had was no fridge or coffee making facilities. Not even a kettle. A coffee machine could be hired for $50 a night!!    NYC is pretty loud and continues throughout the night. I’d suggest ear plugs for light sleepers. There was no noise issues from inside the hotel, more outside with the sirens and traffic.   Overall, if you’re in NYC, you really only need a bed for the night. We found the New Yorker to be a great stopping point and central to so;5
I arrived to the hotel on December 30, 2019 on December 31, 2019 the housekeeping staff was changing the rollover bed because it was damaged. When they were opening the new bed the back part on it felt on my toe resulting in an injury I reported to Michael front desk manager he introduced me to Jack manager of security he brought me some ice packs and he said to me that any medical cost the hotel wasn’t going to cover them if I wanted an EMS or some X-Rays I should pay for them. Apparently they made a report but they never provided it to me and I ask for it and they said it was confidential documents. I wasn’t able to go to the Ball Drop because of the injury, tried to walk a little bit but it was imposible to do so. I asked for a wheelchair and I could move my self a little bit;1
This was our first time to New York and staying at this hotel. Our first impressions when we arrived was WOW. What we especially found, was how friendly the staff were. Everytime we asked a question, they were always happy to help. When we got to our room we could not have been happier. We had a lovely view of the Empire State building. The room was very clean with a very comfortable bed. Our towels were changed daily and always had a fresh smell to them.The bathroom was very clean and the shower was pretty amazing too. When we come back to visit we will most definitely stay at the Wyndham New Yorker. A final message to the staff, thank you so much, you were all very helpful and kind and some with a great sense of humor. Keep up the good work.;5
First time visiting NYC and this hotel is in a great location. We had an upgraded room as I had a special birthday so we had a great view from the 23rd floor. Room was adequate and for a short stay when you don’t spend a lot of time in a room. All the staff were friendly. Best feature is the location. Try The Houdnstooth pub along the road and Andrews Coffee Shop for breakfast.;5
stayed Dec 2018 loved everything about this hotel, stayed again Jan 2020 and the only thing we enjoyed was our room, service was minimal at best no communication between departments, made to feel like an inconvenience more than a guest. Sent in an email to Wyndham and was basically told I would be better off contacting the hotel directly so pretty much passed the buck. I figured my concerns would fall on deaf ears and I was correct;3
I don't really know where to start! We have just returned from a six night stay at this hotel. From the check in process to upgrading the room the whole stay was a disaster. Virgins photographs and descriptions of the hotel are very misleading. After checking in and paying for an upgrade ($172) we made our way to a room. The lobby is the best area in the hotel. After getting out of the lift you are met with dark, dirty and dated corridors. From that moment I knew there was going to be a problem. The first room was no bigger than the bed itself. The room was absolutely filthy. After speaking to reception and changing rooms we were moved to a slightly bigger one which was a bit cleaner. However it was very dated and the bathroom is in real need of repair as the tap was constantly;1
I entered the hotel and was immediately greeted by the doorman, he directed me to the help desk and I was welcomed by Aniana. She was such a sweetheart, she was very respectful and courteous. I felt like a son to her and it was very warming. She was just perfect. Thank you Aniana for your honest help and courtesy. I wish you nothing short of the best, thank you again for how you treated me. If she has any room left for promotion, she deserves it for sure. God bless you and thank you for welcoming to the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel.;5
This was our third visit to the New Yorker over the years and while the public areas used to look a little shabby the art deco interior has now been restored to a high standard.  The standard rooms are pretty small but adequate.  The novelty in our bathroom was that the hot water was scalding and the cold water was pretty warm, so that flushing the toilet had the side effect of warming the seat.  Handy in January.  I had one big surprise when I checked out and I want to make sure others are aware of it - When you (or your travel agent) make a booking, make absolutely double sure that you are quoted a total and inclusive price.  If not, you will be hit by a 'facility fee' of $30 per day plus tax at checkout.  When I could speak, I asked what this charge was for and was told 'it;4
Stayed here from 28th of December until 2nd of January. Reception is lovely, security and door men are lovely and helpful. Girls at reception who I dealt with were not so friendly or helpful. Room was tiny, you will bump in to the person you are with getting from one end to the other. Very dated tired rooms. Radiator wasn’t on at all only AC. I booked a standard queen room, there was nothing queen about the small double bed. Told reception who said I got what I paid for after paying €350 a night for room only. I understand you’re in New York City but for a 4 star hotel there has to be some standards. Paid the $45 a night fee for extras. I didn’t have any extras so got a refund for this when I got home. 3 days later this refund was reverted without notifying me. So €200 taken;2
What can I say, after really looking forward to my first visit to New York, this hotel was a real disappointment.   My family had just stayed in a 4 star in Washington DC, the service was perfect, the room facilities were excellent, coffee machine etc., and the room had plenty of space.   In contrast the New Yorker had very poor service, the desk couldn't get the family names correct even though they were written on the document in front of him. We were charged $20 plus 2 lots of tax per night to change one of the rooms from a double to a twin. Even though we had the rooms we booked in Washington the New Yorker was adamant we booked all double rooms and not a twin.  The room was tiny with minimal facilities, the only thing on offer was water, at a price. The lifts made so much;2
The New Yorker is well situated, especially if you are attending events at Madison Square Garden or wanting to shop at Macy's. It's also an easy walk to the Times Square/Broadway area if you are reasonably fit. Security is good, with entry to elevators monitored. The staff is personable and helpful overall, but be sure that you approach the information desk and not the Wyndham sales desk closer to check-in, where you will have to escape a fairly-high-pressured real estate pitch. When first built, it must have been a real top-tier hotel. Its features reflect its age. It has an elegant lobby. Some rooms that are quite spacious and some that are quite cramped. Ours was one of the latter, and we could hear the guests in the next room well enough that we could probably have;3
"Rooms are old, feels like they don't actually clean but just tighten the bed. Rooms are heated with AC so you can't sleep well. They charge extra for anything they can, saving your luggage, drinking water, packages. Old TV's with nothing to see, which can be fine if there was Netflix on the TV I would be able to access with my account, but the TV""s were to old.";1
We stayed for 4 nights and were given a room on the 35th floor with a great view (pictured). The hotel is really central which is great, it’s not far from the main sights. The room was clean and beds were really comfy. The shower was powerful, really happy with the room. Staff at the information desk were really helpful and polite, and there is a security guard before the lifts to the hotel checking room cards so this made us feel safe.  Upon arrival, we were almost a little pressured to upgrade our room from what we were told was going to be on the 25th floor. When we declined the upgrade at extra cost, we were given a room on the higher floor anyway. A nice gesture to give us the higher room, but we definitely could’ve paid for it without knowing this would’ve happened.  On;4
Yes it’s dated. But-its very clean and comfortable as well as affordable. Also safe. They have security posted 24x7 in the lobby and don’t let anyone enter that does not present a room key. I picked this hotel because of its proximity to Penn Station. Had an early morning Amtrak train. Location was perfect. And our room had 2 bathrooms-that was great! Excellent value. If you don’t care about modern updates and just want a convenient, safe, clean, comfortable, and affordable hotel in Manhattan-this is it. Staff were helpful as well.;4
We stayed from 1 Jan to 2 Jan 2020.  NEVER EVER book this hotel. It is FULL of additional charges. The staff members and managers are rude and condescending. The customer service is terrible.  First, they hit you with a $60 AUD amenity fee for the gym and pool. Erica, the manager on duty, simply did not care if you don't use these amenities and will not waive the $60.  Secondly, this nasty hotel will you charge you $7.50 AUD per day to store each bag, if your room is not ready for check-in.  Thirdly, this greedy hotel will charge you $5.00 AUD for a 300ml bottle of water. Don't touch it, go down stairs to Walgreens and get the same bottle for $1 AUD.  Finally, this stinky hotel has not changed nor steam cleaned the carpet since it was open in the 1930s. The stench of the carpet;1
With so many options of where to stay in New York I would not hesitate to recommend The New Yorker hotel. First I will get the negatives out of the way (& there are not many) - *When we first arrived our room was not ready (fair enough it was before check in time) however to leave all our bags in storage  we were charged $5 per piece of luggage. When travelling from Australia with a family of five that is A LOT of luggage to be checked. I have never before been charged for this for this service and found it a little distasteful.  * Second negative was out on our balcony (YES! we had a balcony, but i will get to that) was a bag of left over food from the previous guests that wasn't cleaned up. We had to step over fries, wrappers, and half eaten burgers :(. Now for the positives;4
The  es Yorker is a very nice hotel where we ha e stayed many times. Walking distance from Penn and easy to go uptown or downtown. The rooms are variable as to size and the type you pick doesn’t seem to make a difference in what you get. I feel the hotel doesn’t give you any extras for the price you pay. No coffee in room unless you add $25 a day. No water unless you pay $5.00. The facility fee is outrageous but they all do it.  So watch your pennies here and shop around. Housekeeping was outstanding. And there are restaurants...3 attached so you don’t ha e to go out.  Great if you have kids.    If you get a good price and want the location and don’t care too much about your room size this hotel is friendly clean and secure.;4
I am mobility impaired and use a wheelchair. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the staff were so helpful.  A man called Mohammed checked us in and he was incredibly kind to us and discussed my wheelchair disability requirements for the room and actually changed the room we’d booked, to one he thought was more suitable for my needs. Mohammed went above and beyond for us.  The room was great. We were on the 33rd floor. Beautiful views of the city!  The two eateries were wonderful as well & reasonably priced.  We had a wet room, which was perfect for my needs. The room was kept very clean & we had a constant supply of towels & clean bedding when required.  The concierge outside the hotel was so pleasant & always flagged down a disabled friendly taxi when we needed one.  The;5
I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in December, i had called the hotel previously to my arrival to ask if i can have the two rooms i booked on the same floor, i was on the phone to them for 40 minutes as they could not locate my booking, i received my bill from my phone company and i had been charged £67 by the hotel for this call. I arrived at my hotel and was told our rooms would not be on the same floor and that if we wanted this we would have to upgrade for $125 per room this meant a better room with a view. The VIEW we had in our room was not a good view at all for an extra payment it was terrible especially compared to the room that my mum had her view was amazing. We complained and asked for a refund on the room but we were told this was not allowed so they relocated us;1
A beautiful art-deco hotel situated on 8th Ave. Very friendly staff, a 24 hour diner on site, with a fantastic Italian and Steakhouse all on site.Gym also available. You don't need to leave the hotel! However, you'd miss Empire State, Madison Square Gardens, Macy's (ALL within 5 minutes walk)-in fact, everything you think of Manhattan wise. Central Park and the Museums are around 20 minutes away.  I walked 12 miles in one day, in an area of around 20 blocks! You can spend a day (and walk that much) in Central Park and still not cover it all! Loved it, hoping to return...;5
Worst experience ever and would not recommend this hotel to family and friends. Had to wait a long time to check in and when I got to the front desk the receptionist was extremely rude and thought she was doing me a great favor, only to find out that the manager was cancelling reservations without informing the guests. Rooms are extremely outdated and not worth the money. Time square is also quite a distance from the hotel. Every time you enter the hotel you have to show your room card which is quite annoying. There’s many nicer hotels then the New Yorker Wyndham on the same road.;1
Stayed at this fantastic hotel in December 2019. From the moment we checked in to the day we checked out, the staff were friendly, courteous and extremely helpful. The room was very clean and comfy, with the fantastic tick tick diner next door, the location is excellent. If you get the chance to stay here, then take it. Can’t wait to come back soon.;5
We arrived on New Years Day , checking in was a doddle , we had a double room with a view of the river. The hotel has kept its original style throughout the hotel , our room was clean and stylish , the beds were comfly and the power shower did the trick. For our short stay we only used the hotel and our room as a base , the rest of the time we were out and about enjoying the sights and sound of NYC. We would like to take this opportunity to wish the New Yorker management and staff a happy new 2020 and good luck for the future. I have reviews you hotel with 5 stars but a suggestion would be to have a kettle in the rooms with free tea and coffee - its only a suggestion.;5
I’d seen The New Yorker many times on holiday sites and hotel booking pages but never visited previously.  Location wise, you’re at the rear of Madison Square Gardens so pretty central and it’s easy to access both my office and most of touristy Manhattan.  The hotel would once have been very grand indeed but has certainly seen better days.   The reception, sorry lobby is spacious but with few check in counters for some reason. The lifts / elevators are guarded by security but they do helpfully point you towards the right set on your first visit (and can also guide you to the gym (basement level) if needed.  My room was spacious with a dual aspect, a rarity in any major city. The bed was comfortable but overall the room was again a little Spartan. The furniture will need to be;3
I attempted to call the New Yorker with some questions and to hopefully make a reservation. Unfortunately the call was outsourced and I couldn't even get to the front desk. Instead, I was transferred off to some half-assed timeshare schpiel. Oh, and then a 2nd half-assed timeshare schpiel where the people on the phone tried to trick me into giving them all my info, including credit card - just so I could get a $25 gift card, wow! After trying to call and complain about this I was transferred to at LEAST 9 different #s and people none of whom could help me. I finally just got in touch with the hotel themselves, and was told to send an email. Well wouldn't you know it I never received a response to that either. Don't stay here, not that you could if you tried. Some of the most;1
Got a family suite based off of pictures on hotels website. Great location, excellent staff, the room on the other hand was severely lacking.  Half the size of what was pictured on the intenet and the bathroom was pretty busted and could use a refresh.;3
Good location. Nice, friendly staff. Room was a decent size really comfoetable beds, bathroom was a bit dated and shower not the best but okay. Excellent location and a reasonable price. Would stay again;4
Went to New York city with  friend for a concert and overnight stay.  Since we took Amtrak,  the New Yorker was just a few minutes walk from the station.  Quick and early check in.  Our room was wonderful,  just enough.  The beds were the most comfortable i have slept in in a very long time. Very clean and enough towels. The hotel lobby was decorated beautifully. Easy walk to restaurants,  Madison Square garden and subways.  Will definitely be back.;5
The hotel room was small but comfortable. The shower was good. It is pretty close to the subway. I had a room only. We came to see New York and its Christmas lights. Mistake. Nothing like the pictures or films.;4
No heat in my daughters room even though we called and went to desk TWICE! Watch your credit/debit card accounts. This hotel put $100 on my card, $180 on my daughters card and we paid in cash. My best friend was charged $1600 twice. She got her money back in a few days but was in nyc with her money floating around in space for 3 days. They told me and my daughter our money would be refunded on our cards but that hasn’t happened!!!;1
We stayed at the New Yorker 13th Dec to 17th Dec. Check-in was a smooth process with friendly staff. A security deposit was taken and we didn’t have to pay the facilities fee as we booked with Virgin Holidays. If you are looking for a reasonably priced accommodation look no further than here. It doesn’t have the wow factor but it does have comfy beds and clean rooms with great housekeeping.;4
Had 4 days in New York and couldn’t fault the location of the hotel. As previous reviews have said, the extra £100 ‘service charge’ is just a stealth revenue uplift for the hotel- you get nothing for it, not even tea and coffee facilities in the room.  Check in team tried to sell and upgrade before we’d even seen our allocated room - definitely recommend you check your allocated room before agreeing to any upgrade (cost!)  Would advise against eating in tick tock - the food is over priced and poor. Forego the convenience factor and venture out a block or two.   Room was ok. Tired and bathroom ‘sweated’ with ceiling dropping water after anyone had a shower.  The key selling point is the location!;3
We picked the New Yorker based on the location due to the purpose of our trip (business/sightseeing). We arrived early around 11:30 a.m. coming from Penn Station. Check in was not an option as I had called the night prior and I was told there was a fee if a room was a available (no room available). We were able to do “precheck in” which just meant we gave them our credit card and ID and phone number and they would call us when a room became available. We could hold our bags there until then. Here comes another fee $5- per bag to hold our bags. This is another first for us. We have never paid to have our bags held in any hotel we’ve stayed at. At that point it was 12 pm and when we returned to the hotel it was around 4:30-5 pm and it was insanity. The hotel never called to let me;3
Great looking hotel , vintage in places , very friendly and helpful staff! Rooms are a decent size view was beautiful everything was great in the room bed, shower tv all great. Gets very cold of a night and had to have the heating on which means not a lot of sleep as the units they use are very loud but other than that brilliant stay!;4
Nice hotel in a good location, with restaurants attached, centrally located in easy walking distance to the Empire and Time Square.  The bedroom was a good size, however the bathroom was small and looks like the original 1920's fittings.  On leaving we wanted to leave our suitcases for a few hours and was charged $20 ($5 per item) but would use it again.;4
First time in USA, stayed in the New Yorker hotel which is very central in Manhattan next to madison square garden. The hotel is very dated but ok for price and amenities. The tick tick restaurant which is joined to hotel was very well priced and staff very helpful. Hope you like walking;3
The staff are very friendly and the doorman were exceptional. The wifi is free but you only have two days to use it and then you have to sign in again, which I can understand why but still no. The location is everything with this hotel, easy to walk anywhere. The subway is just on the corner as well if need be. The room didn't have to much in it, just two beds (which weren't huge), a desk, tv, bathroom and two single couches. Oh and a chest of draws. Would benifit from a kettle and a small fridge.;4
Excellent  hotel right in the central of new York  Great help friendly staff uptown /downtown tours  food  available  Lots of places around close and handy  Walking distance to the empire state building  Madison square garden  Endless shopping, central heating in rooms you can also byo drinks and food in to your room ,ice available  Best time to go is summer 😁 but winter is ok if you want to see snow;5
I am going to start off by stating the good things about the hotel. -The hotel’s location is fantastic. If you are staying in the city after an event at Madison Square Garden, this is steps away and is the place to stay.  -The staff is very friendly. -The hotel is very clean.   Now the bad.  -The “Facilities Fee” is obscene and misleading. To charge almost $40 a day for the use of a gym, that most people are not  going to use and along with a few other minor amenities is wrong. I expected more from a Wyndham hotel and this hotel should be ashamed of how they are ripping off their customers with this fee.  -In spite of paying the “Facilities Fee”, there wasn’t even a coffee maker in the room. Come on, even when you stay at Motel 6, there is a coffee maker in the room.  -The room;2
Second trip to NY first stayed in RIU hotel (amazing). The rooms were really small but we had been upgraded as I asked and it was my 30th. Perfect location across road from Maddison square gardens. Penn station and all subways right outside which was fab for getting about, Deffo get 7days pass for $33 well worth it!! Empire State and Mach within easy walking distance.   Hotel does need a bit of an update especially on some corridors as look a bit outdated and dingy but they are clean. We were on floor 22.;3
Everything about my stay was perfect! Great location to everything. Decent size room, Perfect view, clean, cozy. They brought up extra toiletries with no hassle. Tik tok was convenient and great food. Lobby was beautiful. I am in love with this hotel!;5
We had a fantastic time. Some rooms are small, however, you spend most time visiting places, I don’t see the big deal with those type of complaints. In general people don’t appreciate the human beings  that help you in the reservations, be nice, they are not robots. People complain of everything because they have problems with themselves. Super special  thanks to Samira, Jessica and Lillia.;5
We stayed at the New Yorker for 5 days in December. Our room was tiny, the size of a walk-in closet. The first night, we woke up at 6:30 am to two employees bickering loudly next door. The second day, we returned to the hotel at around 11:30 pm and our room smelled like cigarettes (as if someone has smoked in our room). On our last day, as I was brushing my teeth, the water from the sink came out BROWN. This is the most disgusting experience I’ve ever had at a hotel. I am very surprised this happened at a 4-star hotel.   Putting all of this aside, the room smelled bad in general, the bathroom was dirty, and the TV didn’t work properly. Safe to say I will never stay at this hotel again.;2
We are a family of 4 adults now and the beds were small but doable but we are average size people. If you’re tall or large it would be hard to sleep two. The rooms are spacious though. Good location and the price is on the low end so no complaints;3
I made a reservation for a suite at least a month in advance to have two beds in the same room but a place to get away after our 5 year old went to sleep. Instead, I was told repeatedly how much I would love the room with a queen bed in one room and a pull out sofa in the other. I didn’t love it and the room was horrible. I’ll never book here again!;1
It was really disappointing. I booked two rooms for three nights and immediately want to check out after walking into the room. It was too late to cancel and I felt bad because I took my family here. 1. I was told at the front desk that there is 39 resort fee per night. When I ask what they offer out of the resort fee, they said it was actually facility fee they charge everyone including wifi and business center, fitness center etc...It felt like a random additional charge, PLUS the keys they gave me didn’t even work for the gym! (Later I have to go ask them to add it) . 2. The room was very small and old. AC was loud with some random noise if you keep it open. No coffee machine, fridge, face tissues, which you would expect from a normal hotel room. Considering this is a;2
I generally don't write a bad review about any business until they cross the line..  So first impression about the hotel, I enter the lobby and there are so many people waiting there it feels like an airport, where people are just waiting with nothing to do. It's just dirty. I stand in the line for check in. It was a long 25 minute wait. my problem was that I was moving from a hotel from Long island City to the new Yorker and I just needed to keep my bags and get out because I had an event booking at 4 pm in Randall island. I came in at 1 pm since I was in the area. I asked them if I could just bring the bags and you could give me the room later, I didn't even need to see the room. But the receptionist said that they charge 5$ a bag as luggage storage fees and 50$ for early;1
Just over the road from penn station so it's a breeze getting here quickly from JFK. The art deco interior takes you back to years gone by and whilst the rooms are similarly dated and could do with a refresh they are perfectly clean and functional and the beds/pillows so comfortable. The location though is superb, views of the empire state building when you step out of the front door, steps away from several subway stations to get you all over NYC, 5 mins walk to macys, 10 mins to times square and a 30 min stroll to central park.;4
Went with friends to Bocelli concert at Madison Square Garden. stayed at New Yorker Hotel ate dinner and Breakfast there It was awesome. The room was large the mattress was soooo comfortable There was a Keuriq in the room The shower was easily accessible;5
Good location.  Check in is slow with big queues. Lovely lobby. Room service was good always visited and tidied up. The roons are dated although badged as traditional. Toilet frequently blocked, taps noisy, could hear next door in the shower. Paint peeling off the bathroom walls, shower leaked. Clearly in need of a refurb. No in room facilities such as a kettle only chargeable water. Italian restaurant nice but Tick Tock  average at best with some dubious characters. Acid test.... Would I stay again.... NO.;3
Very Nice place!! Close to Empire State building, across the street from Penn Station, Times Square, and Macy's. We were able to hop on train and go anywhere in the city and we will definitely be back;5
This was our 2nd visit to the hotel. We were disappointed with the room. It was tiny. The room should have been for 1 persons, but 2 of us in the room. No bedside cabinet, having to use window ledge to put water etc. Tiny bathroom. Its ok for just sleeping, very disappointed,  esp after 1st visit.;3
I had tickets for a concert at MSG. We decided to stay close by to avoid traveling late at night.  The hotel was beautiful! We arrived a little early and our room wasn't ready, but we were given a king size bed in a room with a private terrace, and as if ordered special, we experienced a snow squall from the 30th floor....True Christmas in NYC.  Convienient to everything, Nice restaurant within the hotel, a 24 hour diner (Tick-Tock Diner of Sopranno's fame) on premise for late night meal after a show.  Just beautiful!!!  Sorry our stay was just  one night.;5
Stayed in many 4* hotels and this is by far the worst, and the first time I have left a less than positive review. I will start by saying the location is great, right next to Penn station.  Reception staff were nice, however only dealt with them upon check in and check out.  Beds were comfortable and the room was generally clean.  Small, cramped and outdated rooms. Tiny bathroom. For the price and also the photos online - not worth it.  The walls were also so thin we could hear everything next door.   Waiting for the lifts took forever despite there being so many of them and there was always a queue. I hated the thought of returning to the hotel to use them.  Also, one night every single lift was filled with the smell of fish, and everyone was gagging. Still no idea what it was.;2
I booked my holiday direct with the Wyndham quest reservation team. Accepted I had to pay single occupancy and service charge. On arrival I was informed I had to pay $268 at the end of my stay. I pointed out already paid. Receptionist was rude and stated I hadn't. Later in my stay , I tried to discuss this issue again. Insistent I had booked through a booking agency and not guest reservations and stated I had to pay.Still wouldn't have it even with email from Wyndham quest reservation.  This made my holiday at the new yorker hotel extremely expensive.  The service charge was for wifi, use of the gym . My room was small, clean . If I wanted a kettle,  coffee machine or fridge I had to pay for them. This is the first hotel I've stayed in the United States ,where I have not had one;2
We were a bit surprised by the fee to hold our bags before we could get the keys to our rooms. $5/bag. For only $10 more we could have gotten early check in. Ms. Henry at the information desk was great with suggestions on nearby places to visit before getting our keys. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. We were on the 37th floor with a nice view of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and Bryant Park.;4
I love staying at the New Yorker! It’s historic and older, and the amenities may not be the latest and greatest but I enjoy the preservation of the Art Deco style. As long as there’s TV and WiFi, that’s all a person really needs — especially during a short family trip. The location is great and centrally located to so many attractions in NYC, not to mention the subway. Service is fabulous. I love staying here!;4
After reading the reviews I was slightly dubious. Glad we stuck with it. Yes some rooms are slightly outdated (bust you can upgrade to recently renovated ones) yes room was slightly small. But we were never in the room other to sleep and change. Fab location very clean staff friendly and a brill location. New york was amazing !!!;4
Location very convenient.  Love that I could check in early.  Rooms are a little dated but I was able to upgrade to a suite.  Not the suite I was promised (I requested and was promised a terrace - they even emailed me a picture) but I was happy with the room.;4
we had a wonderful stayed for 2 nights , hotel service and staff very kind always assist to us , the room was fantastic very comfortable the chicken burger was awesome and the staff at the desk and restaunt were kind....;5
There was a mix up with our room charge.  Neida, who is an employee in the billing department, quickly and with professional knowlege corrected the issue.  The hotel was comfortable, centrally located and was close to the things we wanted to see.  The metro station was a block away.;5
Stayed here for three nights, excellent location right by penn street subway and near times square.  Check in fine apart from allocating us a room which people were occupying but that was soon sorted by giving us a new room on 25th floor.  The room itself was bigger than expected with two showers (double, double) and suited us fine, it does need renovating but to be honest we weren't in the room for long so for us it didn't matter.  The hotel bar is very reasonable price wise and we didn't use the diner as the hotel is so central.  No charges for us to pay since we booked with virgin holidays but we did have to pay 5 dollars per suitcase to store them on our last day which was to us seemed like a money maker.;4
The New Yorker is a very traditional, well located hotel in the heart of the world, that is 34th St and 8 ave. Despite its immense number of rooms, the elevators work reasonably - with the exception of the period comprised between 7h45-10h00 a.m. You have got to bear this in mind if you are in a rush to take your train or a flight. A very subtle tip would be to divide the numerous elevators (6 to each colums of 20 floors) into a smaller number of floors each, let us say, 3 floors for each elevator. That is the main reason for my 4-star rating, which made me very upset by the time I was checking out. The keys are also very fragile in terms of losing their magnet, as I had to change their code very frequently, something annoying. But, on an average condition, this hotel is;4
We stay in New Yorker hotel over Thanksgiving week. The hotel is located 10min walking distance to time square and beside Pennsylvania station. As 4 star hotel its not even close to 4 star hotels in Europe. It's very old decor need revamp asap. We paid $1400 for suit, believe me nothing special. Overall good stay but for me is basic 3 star hotel.;3
Rooms were smaller than expected.  Not anything like was pictured on the website.  Hotel was clean, staff was great.  Location is awesome.  Food was good.  I would  stay here again.  Just don't expect to stay in a room like is pictured on the website.;4
We had the most wonderfull time of this year! I requested an upgrade when available, but there was no option. We had a fine room (2835), but the staff did their utmost to upgrade the last night of our stay to a Terras Suite with balcony (2623). Awesome! We’ll be back one day, that’s a promise. And we’ll be staying at yours, that’s a fact. Special thanks to Mohammed, Samira and Driss for our upgrade on the last night.;5
The hotel is in the best possible location: right next to Madison Square Garden and a Metro entrance, which makes moving around very easy. We even walked to Central Park, which was only 30 minutes away on foot. The room was quite small, though, and the bed and pillows had seen better days. Some of the staff were very nice and helpful, but others could really improve their manners with guests.  It was also FREEZING cold in the lobby, especially, and corridors. Caught a cold from coming to the August heat in the street into the hotel.;3
Having read the reviews prior to travel, I expected that some of the decor would be dated but in fact the main corridors need a major facelift.   Room was OK but we had to pay extra for a view and the bathroom was small with very little space on which to put toiletries.  The toilet flush was extremely noisy (we could hear the flush in rooms on either side of our room) and it took quite a bit of twiddling to get the shower at a reasonable temperature which wasn't boiling hot or freezing cold.  Floor in the bathroom needed a deep clean too especially around the edges. That said, the Tick Tock diner and the Trattoria were brilliant - amazing food !;4
Nice lobby area, will keep luggage in a store room if you are early $10.per bag. Convienient to Empire State and Times Square. Very tiny bathroom ( we're talking cruise ship tiny). Friendly staff. Good bar with happy hour.;4
We booked this hotel almost two months prior to our upcoming visit after researching hotels that could accommodate families of 5. TEN DAYS before our trip we received a message that the hotel overbooked by 200 rooms! We were given two choices: a room at a nearby hotel with two twin beds or the option to cancel without penalty and receive 25% off for a future stay at the New Yorker. We called for clarification and were told the same story. Offering two twin beds at a lower level hotel when we're a family of five?! Absurd. And what good is 25% off a future stay when we're traveling from out of state? After this fiasco, they think we'd even consider visiting their hotel? Not a chance. We travel frequently - at least once a month. We have never had this happen and can't imagine any;1
This was the worst hotel I’ve stayed in in years yet one of the most expensive.  The room was run down, uncomfortable and felt overall dirty because of its state.  Even though we were on the 24th floor, the windows may have been the original and we could hear all street sounds.  The sheets were scratchy and beds felt like a brick.  I would not recommend-far better hotels in NYC for the same price.  I thought Wyndham had a standard but if this is it, I won’t stay at one again.;1
Excellent hotel. Great location.Great  having a 24 hr. restaurant as part of it.Would recommend this hotel to anyone and would use it again for any further trips to New York. Hotel has a lot of history and caracter.;5
The location of the hotel is perfect however it ends there. We paid for a executive double with a view and were told the day before it was fine but when we arrived it was there's a burst pipe. We were given a room on the 7th floor which looks into class room/ training room. We tried to complain but got no where. The carpet was bumpy and if i was unsteady on my feet I would have tripped. The shower leaks regardless of the towels on the floor to stop the water flooding the room.  The room was a lot smaller than what we paid for.  When I returned home we emailed to complain which seems to have been ignored.;1
It was very nice, but a very old hotel and really needs to have the rooms updated.  I might consider staying there again.  Of course at the holiday times it is very expensive but not. worth that much money.;4
Nice hotel with a great location. The hotel itself looks antique but rooms were clean and cosy with 2 small-double beds which were extremely comfy, lots of storage space too. Friendly staff, free wifi and telephone in the room.;5
I don’t know where those 4 and 5 stars are coming from!! Has to be paid reviews. Smdh.  I had the unfortunate experience of staying at this antiquated Hotel recently. When I arrived, there was NOBODY manning the desk and I had to call out SEVERAL times before someone came out AND with attitude.  He couldn’t find my reservation, although I had my confirmation email and said he would have to check HIS email to see and proceeded to help ANOTHER patron who was waiting in line. WTH?!!!  AFTER assisting that customer he came back to me. Checked his email and then passed me off to another coworker. Mind you his badge said manager. So now this other worker named Samira, who was UBER RUDE, was booking me in and asking if there are any rooms although I had a CONFIRMED booking.  Now whilst;1
Conveniently located near Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Great access to subway, Times Square, Rockefeller Center.  Property is a bit tired looking and could use an update. Rooms are small but clean.;4
We would have rated this 3 but the maid used lots of my partners Lamer cream which is rather expensive. Appalling.   Positive. Good location. Time square ten minutes walk.   The room we had was tiny. Paid $25 per night for a room with a view but the window was so filthy it kind of ruined it.   Obviously an old hotel but been refurbished. The room is okay but the bathroom is poor and very cramped.   If all you want is somewhere just to sleep it’s okay and we’ll located. Just don’t leave anything valuable in your room.;1
Had a brilliant time in the New Yorker. Our room was lovely, not very big but great comfy bed and great shower. Best of all was the view,no need for us to book a skyline view of the city, we had it from our room. Sitting on the bed and looking out at the EMPIRE State Building, Crysler Building, Madison Square garden. Fabulous by day and night.  Very central hotel, across the road from Penn station, Macys is around the corner.  Will definitely stay again next time in New York.;5
Whilst sitting in a great location the hotel feels tired and not as good as expected.   The reception staff were functional rather than welcoming.   The concierge was very abrupt.   Most of the staff didn’t live up to the usual American friendliness experienced elsewhere in New York.  Having mentioned we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and booked four rooms I was disappointed that even though guest relations had requested an upgrade of our room, when we checked in they decided to give the upgraded room to my son and not my wife and I.;3
We were upgraded to a lovely big room however this meant there were not one but 3 drafty windows.  I had the heating up to 38 degrees and was still sleeping in my socks and puffa jacket.  We paid an extra $30 ish for taxes and premium WiFi.  The WiFi was atrocious and when I called tech support I was put on hold for 15 mins so simply didn’t have the internet for my stay there.  The bathroom was tiny with another drafty window right next to the tiny shower.  Apparently women in the 30s didn’t have as many toiletries as we do.  There wasn’t even room for my toothbrush, I can’t imagine that ladies didn’t clean their teeth almost a century ago.  Don’t expect free tea and coffee facilities - that’s an extra $25 per day.  The receptionist was very pleasant when I complained but;2
I emailed the Wyndham New Yorker hotel after receiving my bank statement showing that an unauthorised charge of USD 176.97 was made following my stay from 17-19 November 2019.  However, when I made this booking, I paid all the charges and hotel tax in advance. I also confirmed that no further charges would be made at check-in and when checking out, and the member of staff on duty assured me that no additional charges or resort fees would be made in connection with this booking.   Please could you reply to me regarding the money you have taken from my account in accordance with New York's Unfair Trade Practices Law. This includes a non-sterling transaction fee of £3.77, and brings the total unauthorised amount you have taken to £140.95.;1
Hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful. Location is great - it's just by the subway, and you can walk to every major tourist spot, e.g. Time's Square, Boardway..........etc.  Even though the hotel is a little dated, it still worked out very good. I'm lucky to get into the premier terrace family suite on 38th floor. Room size is good and the view is stunning facing the Empire Building. Special thanks to Lynn and Linda in the front desk - So nice & helpful !;4
Hotel in style of art deco is very clean, well located and security is excellent.  Tick Tock Restaurant on site is great for food at all hours. able to bring our therapy dog with us as the hotel is pet friendly. I am a Wyndham time share owner so was able to use my points for this stay;5
Love this hotel in all its former glamour and glory. Location opposite Madison sq gardens, Penn station. View of empire state and times sq..both about 5-10 mins walk away. Stayed from 27 nov to 3 december. Loved NYC..thankyou hotel great stay warm and clean plus beautiful tree and decorations;5
Perfect location for any of New York tourist attractions. Very quiet hotel, comfortable beds, pillows and towels.  Safe included with room.  Able to store luggage for a $5 fee if checkout is before your shuttle back.  Across the street from Penn station subway, walking distance to many great eateries.;5
Beautiful hotel, great location. Rooms are a little dated and compact but had a powerful shower and comfortable bed which was all i needed. Staff were friendly and helpful. Tick Tock diner and butcher &banker restaurant on site would definitely stay there again.;4
"Stayed at the New Yorker for 5 days while in NYC over the Thanksgiving holiday.  I stay here often; it’s my ‘go to’ place when in the city.  Great place!!  People are friendly, service is very good at checkin, though they gat busy at times ( like all hotels will ).  Special room requests are met quickly. It’s a great place to stay when in midtown Manhattan, especially for an event at MSG.";5
Ok so - despite some less than favourable reviews about this hotel recently don’t let this put you off - in short for us - there was absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel & I would go back.  The lobby is lovely & we were greeted by a lovely man in reception who checked us in quickly. We had a room on the 34th floor with a partial  view of the city - was it small? Yes it was smaller than what you’d be used to in UK hotels but it was perfectly adequate for 2 adults. There was a walk in wardrobe where we stored our coats & our hanging clothes & we put everything else in the chest of drawers in the room. The bathroom was fine - reallly good shower with plenty of hot water - tv with loads of channels, iron, ironing board, hairdryer, toiletries but no tea or coffee facilities;4
I will be recommending the New Yorker, Wyndam hotel to all family and friends. The staff is so friendly, everything works so efficiently, not to mention the convenience of having the Tick Tock Diner right there, adjacent to the hotel. Please pass on my most sincere gratitude for the wonderful staff at the hotel and diner. Everyone, from first checking in to housekeeping, mailroom staff, everything was sheer perfection. The location was so convenient to Macy's, to the subway, stores, just a superb experience all around. My daughter and granddaughter and I send our most sincere thanks to everyone for the most pleasant Thanksgiving experience, thanks to your devotion to your guests!;5
This hotel is conveniently located in the midtown area. Not too far from time square and many other attractions. Hotel was very clean. Staff was extremely friendly. The view from the room was absolutely amazing. There was a cool little diner downstairs that’s open pretty late so it was convenient when we got back to the hotel and need some extra food. Plus I was even able to buy some champagne there and take it back to the room. I will definitely stay here again.;5
Kept me for nearly two hours saying that they have not received the credit card payment . I couldn’t do my Big Bus tour because of that . Was staying only one night in NY. Hence it was big time lost for me. Guest service and facilities you can’t even compare for what you get in my city ...Dubai;3
i go to the New Yorker a few times every year and it never disappointing to  us. Clean, friendly and professional staff. Tick/Tock Dinner  next store best breakfasts and lunches.  I watched a maintenance woman, middle age blond  woman  clean the lobby this morning, Dec, 8 and she never stopped working, making sure every corner was clean and had smile on her face for everyone. You can tell that the culture and climate of this service and hotel starts with the top and trickles down to everyone.;5
Room 2026 a little tight when two people trying to get dressed. Bed very comfy. Great shower with lots of hot water. Noisy at night from outside, window wasn’t very sound proof. Central location.  Tick tick diner good value, extensive menu.;4
We stayed at this hotel for five days in November hoping that it would be better than The Hudson Hotel where we stayed last year. On the whole it was better although our room on 22cnd floor was tiny. At least we had a decent sized bathroom, not the teeny weeny one at the Hudson. We would have loved to have had coffee making facilities in the room instead of the luke warm bottle of water left for us at an extortionate price. We looked forward to using the Tick Tock Cafe attached to the hotel during our stay as the reviews were quite good. All I can say about it was that some people are not choosy. We thought the food was mediocre and very pricey.We only went the once!. It was better than our last hotel, but one the Hudson it was quite shabby in places and needs some careful;4
The hotel is great , location is excellent , rooms are small and cold but suitable for what you need but the service leaves a lot to be desired   Upon arrival I was asked for a credit card for the fees - 2 days later I noticed over £700 has been secured against my card - went to reception to complain and they apologised and said it would be rectified   24 hours later another fee of over £400 taken against my card so nearly £1200 over half of my spending money was secured against these fees   Went to reception - received an apology and was told it was a error and I would receive all fees back and a discount against my stay which I have to wait for from BA  The fees have been returned but Its taken until 5 days after my return and no good to me now as I needed that money whilst I;3
8th time staying at this Amazing hotel. Great welcome on arrival, Stayed in room 1901 which was clean and spacious for 4 ladies with 2 bathrooms which went down a treat. Really can not fault this hotel and will be rebooking for the same week next year. Tick Tock Diner was fab each morning for breakfast.;5
After probably hundreds of hotel stays, this hotel was the was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The only redeeming factor is the proximity to the subway.  They rent most of the hotel out to a college for dorms or vacation stays. This means that the hotel is extremely loud and filled of drunk students. Every night I was woken up by kids screaming up and down the hallways.  As for the rooms, they are extremely small and filthy. I had to buy flip flops for the shower like a true college dorms. I had a leak in the bathroom that I complained about everyday and after day three nobody had come to look at.   Please please do yourself a favor and book at any of the other hotels. This hotel is listed at 3.5 stars but that’s only because of its lobby. The rooms are not better than;1
Never been to a hotel without coffee pot or coffee.   I have now.   Housekeeping doesn't keep coffee on the cart.    Have to call front desk for coffee daily. And ask for coffee pot.   All vents need cleaning badly.   Location is great for site seeing.  The hotel does need upgrading with decor.  The door men were helpful.  The front desk people answered our questions but had no personality.   I would probably stay again but would try to get reservations somewhere else.;3
This is my second visit to The New Yorker. I think I booked more as it held very sentimental memories of my first ever visit and this Rhine I was lucky enough to bring my daughter and was excited to show her bits of fond memories. The first being when I was 21 and I am now 37. nothing has changed at all.  The room itself was very clean and comfortable.  We were 4 in a room and it was tiny. We had no where to hang our clothes so had to live out of our cases which was also hard as there was no where to put them! Didn’t spoil our time as we literally only slept there.  Location is brilliant and the pizza place across the road is amazing!!! My issue was with the staff on reception. Clueless and rude come to mind. I’ve been Charged the equivalent of £15 for a bottle of water which I;3
OK, it is quite difficult to find a hotel in NYC that is somehow affordable and provides a room that has an adequate size. New Yorker Wyndham charged me USD 460 incl. tax and fees per night - and all I got was a broom closet. Impossible to place your suitcase or even backpack somewhere, the room was immediately no longer walkable. Windows were drafty, so I had to position the extra pillows in front of the window to avoid Nanga Parbat temperatures. Location is good, staff is more or less friendly but the entire facility urgently needs a refurbishment. After checkout I wanted to leave my 2 bags with the concierge for a couple of hours and after having paid USD 1.380 for my three nights the hotel charged me an additional 10 USD for the storage. As a frequent traveller I never;2
"On two nights business related stay in Manhattan I chose the hotel for it's location near Penn Station.  Arriving at the hotel at noon, the clerk tells me me my room is ready but my rate only allows me to check in at 4pm. Therefore for a mere 50$ I could check in early. The weather outside is turning and the rain changes to snow. Let's do it.   What a ""customer first"" experience... NOT!  I head over to store my luggage and the guy asks me for 5$. I have never been at hotel before that charges money for this, but here I go.. Than I ask if I can tie my backpack to the big luggage, and the guy says sure, but it's five more dollars, I'm like no way and head out into the snow...  Everything else is normal, but old and a bit rundown, though everything works and nothing is obviously";3
Disappointed after hearing this was a great hotel 😔. Room for 4 people is tiny and nothing like the photos on website! We could barely get into room & couldn’t even fit cases in. Had no option but to pay for upgrade as could not have lived on top of each other for 4 nights. Very dated and grubby. Definitely not 4*!;1
Stayed here for 3 nights, flew from UK with Virgin Atlantic and they recommend this hotel  Check efficient, staff friendly. Room was a bit small but comfortable although didn’t spend much time in it anyway  Key thing about this hotel is great location for site seeing.;4
We booked this hotel based on bring  a 4 star hotel. We got very disappointed upon our arrival. We not even greeted properly by the staff and the reception. Our room was shockingly small and looked dirty and old. Our bedsheet and pillows were very uncomfortable. Bedsheets felt like toilet paper. Pillow were too uncomfortable and high that we had to take the ibuprofen on daily basis due to neck pain. I called the housekeeping and asked for a another type of problem pillow. She said this is our standard pillow and we do not have other options. We could hear the people next to us when they talked or even coughed. We also heard water running through the pipes. We approached the front desk with our concerns and the lady at the desk started with saying that she “has 20 years of;1
This was a trip for my 60th birthday with my 2 sisters.  The hotel was a bit dated but clean, staff friendly and helpful.  We did have to change room as our first room was far too small for 3 adults. Room was changed without any hassle.  We had a view of the Hudson out of one of the windows in the room and the views out of the other one were nice too.  The Christmas tree was beautiful.;5
The BEST, Cleanest, Most Friendly HOTEL in New York. A special thank you To Miss Ann,Mr Barry, Mr. Michael , Mr Herbert and Miss Nadia Thank you for Being You, Thank you For ALWAYS Treating me Not as a Guest But ALWAYS LIKE FAMILY. You are the VERY BEST Hotel in New York City. The Best Staff The Cleanest The Very Best;5
We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Our room was on the 23rd floor. We were given a little fun and funky multi-room suite. We had a dinning/sitting area with a desk and open views down and over the Hudson. There was an apart bedroom with 2 double beds. There was a bathroom and an apart wc. Everything was clean and kept neat, that's important.  Yes, things were a little dated here and there - but that is exactly what we love - a place where you can tell that people have felt that they could relax and live in.  Surf and you will find that there is some really cool history in this building as well.  The staff was always friendly and always gave us a smile when we came in.;5
Check in wasn't great, Greeted by OZLEM, at reception, who had a very bad manner. she then asked for a $200 deposit, incase we break anything, well let me tell you, there was absolutely nothing to break.weirdly the couple booking in next to us, were not asked for a deposit, so its definitely up to who checks you in and their mood.   we in for a shock- for a 4*, I would grade it a 2, the room was 4sqm, . It was clean, the bedding, towels and shower curtain was brand new, but it was a very dated decor, that needed a urgent update. The window looked out onto a brick wall. and to say I didn't sleep would be a under estimate , all night was dustcarts, sirens and people screaming. we had booked a bed and breakfast, and we were given token cards for the tick tock cafe attached to the;1
2 friends and I stayed at The New Yorker for a weekend getaway trip, and had a great time. The room, and bathroom were both clean, and housekeeping did a great job during our stay. The staff was professional, helpful, and pleasant. The view from the upper floors was great, and it's a relatively short walk to the Empire State Building. They were even able to accommodate a special request - one of my friends really wanted to stay in the Tesla room, and they made it happen! We ate at the Tick Tock Diner for breakfast 2 of the days during our stay, and had good experiences there both mornings as well (good food, good staff). Overall I would highly recommend the New Yorker.;5
Great stay!  Room was clean, bathroom was clean. Housekeeping reliable. Relatively quiet. Great location to Madison Square Garden.  Macy's and other retail stores just a couple of blocks away. Would definitely stay here again.;5
The location was great for my stay with my family during our Thanksgiving visit as we wanted to see several places in the city and other places we had stayed in the past were not as convenient.  I wasn't sure what to expect based on some of the negative reviews by supposedly travel agents and others.  I had three rooms and all the rooms were great.  All of the staff we met were friendly and helpful.  I am not sure where the negative reviews are coming from but we had a great experience at the hotel.  I will stay again when I am in NYC. It was a great experience, great location, and would do it again.;5
After reading other reviews before going I thought I had made the wrong choice. But I have to say what a great 5 nights we had, beds really comfortable, the maid kept our room spotless everyday very quiet at night. The location is great to, and the dinner downstairs Tick Tock had many a great breakfast there, would definitely go back 😁👍;4
Good location near MSG and Penn station. The hotel has a number of floors/rooms occupied by students wasn’t expected by us. We are finding it difficult to sleep on a night due to noise from the windows you can’t avoid as a room swap did not cure the issue. Corridors and lifts need a refurb.   Don’t believe the 4* talk it’s more like a British 2 star hotel. Disappointed could be much nicer. Can fault staff.;2
On two visits I requested early checkin but was told the room was not ready, in one case until 6pm. If I had  known I couldn’t get into my room before 4-6pm I would have cancelled and gone to another hotel.   Late departure seems to have priority over early checkin, so I will not return to this hotel.;2
Just came back from a memorable 1st trip to Newyork.Stayed at The Newyorker. The hotel was lovely and clean and close to all amenities Penn Station situated just across the road. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room we stayed in was a very good size had a big bathroom clean towels daily, the beds are the most comfortablest I've ever slept in didn't hear any noise from the hustle n bustle outside. Overall 5* from me for the Newyorker will definitely be staying here again.;5
My wife and I booked New York for our 1 year wedding anniversary.  We booked the New Yorker hotel as it's somewhere my wife had always wanted to stay and with it being an iconic hotel in New York and it's skyline.  Upon arrival to the hotel, at the check in desk we were met by a very rude lady who told us that in addition to the resort / facility fee of $32 a night, we also needed to hand over a credit card for them to hold a further $400 to be held as a security deposit in case of damage to the room. When we said that all of our money is in cash, they said that if we wanted to pay this in cash they would charge up to $900?!? We advised that this was our spending money so they agreed to reduce this to $475 which was a massive chunk of our spending money. Excellent service (NOT).;2
I usually don't write reviews but feel compelled to share the lousy experience that many travellers would not expect from a hotel under Wyndham, let alone in an iconic hotel like the New Yorker. To get started, I've stayed there for about 5 days with a baby.   I came back one night to find that my little travelling kettle that I use for making hot water for the baby's milk missing. Couldn't find it after ransacking the entire family room. Now imagine doing that with the baby crying for his milk! When I called the front desk they aren't sure what happened and reckoned that it could be taken by one of their staff. Only after a few phone calls that they deduced it could be taken by their security team but couldn't confirm as 'the team is off duty'. What comes next takes the ante -;2
"Stayed here for 4 nights. Started out bad when I asked about the facility fee ($100.96) and what is was for. They explained it included use of the following: Business center, which we had no need for and said we didn't want to use it. Fitness center, which we had no need for and said we didn't want to use it. National and international calls, which we had no use for and said we didn't want to use. ""Premium"" WiFi, which when you went to to WiFi portal page said it was free and also shouldn't even be included under this charge as the facility fee is taxed and the PITFA (Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act) bans all taxation on internet and email services. So by proxy the internet service has been taxed.  When I said we didn't want to pay it as we were not going to use any of the";2
Artived here for a 5 day stay.  Firstly the travel agent misled me a put the hotel if you could call it that. Secondly the mouthy receptionist smiled when she charged me an add £550 in security deposit ....not a good advert....then room wasn't what was booked.  A view of the Empite State building....in reality review over a derelict building site. Room was like a wardrobe and you had to close the door to use the bathroom. No food no coffee and charged $30 per night for the privilege of using the tv or internet even if you didn't.  No seats in reception because they were to idle to turn them round for people to sit on whilst they decorated the Xmas tree a day late as Thanksgiving was the day before . I sat on the back of a setee and was ordered to get of it even though I am;1
Excellent location near Penn Station.  The room was very comfortable, so are the beds.  It is an Art deco building if I am not wrong.  The room and bathroom still have an old charm.  The view from the room was stunning at the 31st floor.  Would come back and recommend.;4
Can't wait to stay there again.  Great location, friendly staff, very clean.  Maybe a little pricey but then again, this is NYC.  I would recommend this hotel highly.  I would not stay any other place in New York.;5
The hotel is beautiful. The perfect location for for walking in Midtown. The staff was very kind. We loved the old charm. Our rooms were very clean and spacious with amazing views. We will definitely be back.;5
This hotel is perfectly located close to MSG and Penn Station. It´s a perfect stay for a weekend trip in NYC. For us it was nice to stay at a hotel close to Penn Station since we landed and flew from Newark Liberty International Airport. There are trains going between the airport and Penn Station so you don´t have to take a taxi if you stay at this hotel. However the standard at the hotel is mediocre, the service is good, but the rooms are just OK, not more than that.;4
It was my first time in New York City and when I think of a hotel in NY, The New Yorker pops in my mind because of what I see in movies or shows. The hotel has a certain charm. It is well preserved and the rooms are new. It’s very clean and all the staff were courteous and attentive. I highly recommend this hotel.;5
Room is tiny - understandable considering this is NewYork. But toiletries were not good quality. Room keep smelling sometimes. If you want to store cool drinks or some eatables, there's no fridge at all. Coffee/Tea Machine is not there. Even small 2 or 3 star hotels offer these basic amenities.;1
Arrived to find there was a mix up with our room ,Not the hotels fault but Mohammed sorted everything out went above and beyond To facilitate us, we couldn’t speak highly enough about him Helen & Tara O’ Connor;5
"First impressions set the tone when I checked in early in the day (not expecting my room yet) and the registration clerk tried to up-sell me early access to ""a great room"" for $50 cash only. I declined and checked my bags as I had a day of work meetings and didn't need the room until later.   Little did I know that I'd be downgraded for having declined.  When I finally returned to claim my room key, I was surprised to find I'd been assigned a room that was not much larger than my bathroom at home.  It had a lovely view, high on the 35th floor which I appreciated only long enough to realize that the room was cold, very cold, even though the thermostat was set at 72.  I could hear the wind whistling in the bathroom through the un-insulated, painted over bathroom windows. The bed";3
I've been to NYC multiple times and the New Yorker is the only hotel I'd stay at.  The rates are reasonable for NYC and the accomodations are great! If you want a quick snack or drink, or want to enjoy a great meal, it's all right here!;5
Just got back from this hotel yesterday. This was my 3rd visit to New York and probably my last. Previously stayed near grand central and on 42nd street/Times Square.  Chose this hotel for the location and it was part of a virgin holidays deal with lounge access at Heathrow.  Arrived at JFK (what a joke immigration is!) and got the air train and LIRR straight to Penn station in half an hour.  Reception allowed us to check in early for no fee into our queen metro room ( did ask about upgrading but for $65+ tax per night didn’t bother). Corridors to the room looked like something from American horror story (the hotel one) and the room was very small. It was clean enough but very tatty and rough around the edges but we were told the other side of the hotel had been upgraded and;2
This hotel does exactly what it says it will.   It is a comfortable, safe and convenient hotel opposite MSG and a 5 min walk from Time Square.   We stayed 5 nights. We got clean sheets every day, took five mins to check in and out. Room is quite small but is completely managable. Good shower and bathroom.   Decor is a little dated, but is in keeping with overall age of the hotel. Also has a good gym.   Perfect for a couple of visitying NYC.;5
Our room was clean and comfortable, on the 32 floor but no city Veiw. There was a facility charge of $160 for 4 nights and $132 resort fee. Although there is free WIFI in the lobby area, and we had our own data. the receptionist said it was a facility fee and it had to be paid by credit card, no explanation was given to what it actually covered. There was a Diner just off the lobby, the food is nice and plenty of variety. Also a tea and coffee station. Again at a higher charge than Starbucks across the road. Would I stay here again? No, for the price we paid for this accommodation it was disappointing, the lobby was all show but the decor of the rooms were tired and outdated there were 2 bottles of water in the room but these were at a charge if opened. The facility charge is a;4
Paid 600$ for 5 nights here. On arrival got charged a further 550$ in taxes security deposit and compulsory service charges for electric water and internet.. Reception doesnt look bad. Staff smile as you get ripped off.  Lifts antiquated corridors dirty and scruffy looking and rooms so small like tiny boxes crammed in together. No kettle so cant make a drink. Bathroom like something out of the 1920s old fashioned and out dated. No breakfast allowed so have to go out all the time to eat. Wouldn't reccomend this dump to anybody. There are a lot of better hotels than this place;1
I always give honest reviews and was a little disappointed with this hotel.  Start with the negative  We stayed 4 nights in one of the cheaper rooms, well it must have been as the view was another hotel window on 33rd floor.  The room was tiny and the bottles of water they put were double the price of the 7eleven across the road loud roadworks could be heard as the windows didn’t close properly  The lifts were hit and miss it took 15mins to get to reception Saturday morning as the full lift stopped on every floor down to 21 then went up again so annoying.  Plus points  Location was excellent and felt safe as security wouldn’t let you up without a door card How water bath and shower were ok.  The diner attached was top class see my Tick Tock review  Most importantly the bed and;3
"I had one night at the New Yorker when I unexpectedly decided to book an extra night in New York City. At $343 for the night, it was not cheap by any means, but most similar hotels were priced around the same at the time (mid October 2019).  The hotel has a pretty late check in time of 4 PM (compared to the standard 3 PM) and indeed, when I checked in, I was told my room was not ready, so I decided to store my bag until I could check in later. I was pretty shocked to learn that I had to pay a $5 fee to store my bag for a few hours. I've never been to a hotel before or since that charged for that ""service"".   Once I got to my room, I found that it was incredibly small and cramped. There was barely room for the bed. The room had no view either, except of the building opposite";2
Booked 10 nights in this hotel through my travel agent and it was not cheap. Staff were great , room adequate however rooms were booked out to huge groups of college kids which meant no sleep for the last 5 nights .  Felt like I was staying at a backpackers or on school camp. Terrible. One star for staff and one for location.;2
Maybe a typical NY hotel, small bathroom with no where to put your stuff, old building where the light blew out twice in the same day in the bathroom, hard to regulate temperature in the room. From desk, valet, and the people were great. Web site doesn't state there is a restaurant but there are two attached which both were acceptable. Location to MSG is prefect. Would do it agin;4
This was my first visit to NYC and it did not disappoint.  The New Yorker overall was a great place to stay.  The rooms were small but we had a corner room and the views were fantastic!  The service was great and everyone we talked to at the hotel were very helpful and kind.  The location was perfect to visit many tourist spots and the subway was very close to the hotel.  There wasn't a great deal of close restaurants but the ones we found in walking distance were good.  The only negative we had was when we made the reservation they asked if it were a special occasion and we said it was our 33rd Anniversary yet nothing was said or done.  Then in an email they asked if we would like to upgrade our room (for a price) and my husband wanted to surprise me with a view of the Empire;4
As a couple visiting the USA for the first time we were welcomed with open arms at the New Yorker. We paid all our hotel fees prior to our stay so it was just a case of paying the temporary deposit. The hotel presented itself really well and all services and staff were perfect. The staff themselves were professional, polite and very friendly. The hotel itself was beautiful and had all the available facilities to accommodate us during our stay including free Wi-Fi. The staff answered any questions/concerns we had in a helpful and reassuring way. Now the hotel itself is quite historic and old so it is in need of a little renovating here and there but it doesn't ruin the experience. The rooms have the same problem but they are clean and adequate which is what matters. The;5
The rooms themselves were fine. The hotel is FINE. Its an older building with interesting history and a pretty cool little set of museum stuff in the business area. But the rooms are VERY small. Which I know isn't that wild of a thing in New York City but its not ideal as I was traveling with a lot of luggage for a convention and had almost no room to put it. The bed took up half of the room. Which again I understand and its fine. Not Ideal but fine. My main issue and why I'm giving such a low rating is that when I booked my room well in advance in August I booked it for 2 people. I wasn't sure if my friend could come with me so I didn't add her name to reservation. That SHOULDN'T have mattered. But when I added her name to the reservation about a week before the check in date;2
I am a world traveler and this was honestly one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The fact that this hotel claims to be a 4 star hotel is an outright lie. I have stayed in several real 4 star hotels and this hotel is more like a 1 star hotel. The lobby looks nice and the photos of the rooms are extremely misleading which is all to trick travelers into thinking the hotel is actually decent, but this is all a lie. As soon as you get off the elevator to your room, the hallway is dim, carpets are old, walls need painting, and it smells musty. The rooms themself are literally a few feet larger than the bed and the bathroom was just mediocre and extremely old fashioned. The bath faucet dripped loudly the entire stay, there was hardly any counter space above the sink, and they;1
I’ll get a couple positives out of the way, hence the 2 star review: -great location -comfortable bed -nice lobby  Now for the rest: -I understand part of this hotel’s appeal is the retro/Art Deco vibe, but literally nothing was updated or in good condition. I’ve stayed in plenty of hotels that trade in nostalgia and have been much nicer and better kept up.  -tiniest hotel room I’ve stayed in in a long time. Just a bed and a narrow walkway to the bathroom.  -Not nearly enough towels provided. Found this out the hard way when I was dripping wet and my husband had to call down for more towels. Took almost an hour for them to be delivered.  -the bathroom has no fan or ventilation. This means after you shower the whole bathroom and everything in it is literally dripping wet from the;2
Went to NYC for a 50th Birthday pressie and I booked this hotel as part of a package of which I was not disappointed by  this location of the Hotel or it's staff. Located right in the heart  of the city - Maddison Square Gardens opposite, 5 mins walk to Macy's and 10 mins if that to the Empire State Building. Upon checking in - I had no issue at all - the reception staff whilst busy were very polite and friendly and allowed us to check in early as a waiver which was a very nice service indeed. The queen metro room ( paid extra for a view) whilst small was very clean and tidy and actually very comfortable - no issue with house keeping or the condition/apperance ( Room 3303).Yes some of the corridors are a little outdated but it has  an art deco feel that cannot be replicated with;5
"Well where do you begin, if you like Art Deco architecture it's fabulous. As a hotel it leaves a lot to be desired. Lobby etc.great,rooms are a lottery. Allegedly they are STILL in the process of upgrading rooms.I presume we were allocated a room awaiting an upgrade. The only description  is shabby. Staff again are a lottery, some great, others surly at best.The Tick Tock diner which is part of the establishment is reasonably priced for NYC is tragic, food and service wise.This hotel need to get their act together, not rest on their past laurels. Shame though it is. Go else where.P.S.When checking out no one asked""How was your stay?""If they had asked I would have voiced my concerns rather than this negative review.";3
Just returned from a week at The New Yorker. I cant fault the position of the hotel but it is certainly not 4 star! Advertised as re modernised definitely not ! We booked a metro room which was supposedly modernised! Old sink and bath fittings decoration looking shabby and a TV which was supposedly flat screen which came out of the ark! The room was dark as we were facing another part of the hotel, only feet away.  They have rented out several floors to student accomodation which again is very strange for a 4star hotel and means at some times there is excessive noise. When you book on arrival they then sting you for a $40 a night facility fee ontop of your original booking . This is for the business centre , Gym and something else quite random and even if you dont want to use;2
We were warmly welcomed by Samira and her colleague Mohamed to this fantastic hotel.  The rooms were great and Samira went to great lengths to maximise our comfort coupled with stunning views of the city.  The hotels location allowed us to fully explore the city with direct access to transportation and lots of places only abwalk away.  We have found our base for all future NYC trips.  Great location, great rooms and superb,  friendly, helpful staff.  P.S. Tick Tock Diner on site does a great breakfast!;5
"Have to say as a 1st time in New York that I was so disappointed with what is a 4star hotel. Had contacted the hotel on several occasions to request a high floor looking towards the Empire state building. I also requested a fridge in the room which I paid for. On Arrival the hotel put us in what I can only describe as a prison cell. There was no enough room to swing a cat and a view of a building wall. There was pieces of old paper hiding cracks in the bathroom door!!!. I immediately went to reception to complain and despite showing the confirmation emails of my request they were stubborn and unhelpful. Eventually they agreed to move the next day but we had to pick up the cost of the ""upgrade"" onto a accessible room. We agreed that all our belongings would be moved by the staff";1
Great location. Just down the block from Macy's, across the street of Penn Station with elevator for the subway station. CVS right across the street. Good Chinese restaurant down 8th. We have stayed there twice.;4
We had two night here and our experience was perfect, thanks for your attention  and quality  service, that one of the nice things, we enjoy the area and the room with our time here. Next time we can choose this place again.;5
We picked this hotel for its premium location. It is walking distance to the Javits Center where we are headed for Anime NYC 2019. The room was really clean and welcoming and we were very satisfied with our experience and top notch service we received!;5
My wife and I have stayed in this hotel three times before sailing back to UK on the QM2. It is an old fashioned hotel and the rooms are a bit dated, but the staff are efficient and security is good. We found it easy to get to from JFK by using the LIRR (Long Island Rail Road) to Penn Station which is just across the road from the hotel. The first time at the hotel the Tick Tock Cafe was full so we went over to Penn station for breakfast. Time Square, Empire State, and many other tourist sites are within walking distance.;4
We have just returned from a 7 night stay at the New Yorker, we were fortunate enough to have a suite on the 39th floor! The room was lovely,  the views were amazing!!!The location makes it easily accessable too! (Right next to Penn Station rail & subway connections) We found all the staff to be very friendly & helpful & would especially like to thank Samera on the front desk! & Joseph in the Hotel's Tick Tock Diner. See you next time....;5
Booked here because of proximity to Penn Station / access to EWR. Figured rooms would be tiny in an old hotel and they were. No problem there. Downsides: once they have your email address they just don't let up in their effort to squeeze every last nickle out of you. Frequent offers to buy upgrades, meals, tours, etc., etc. Arrive daily in the run up to your stay. Want a check-in prior to 4pm? That will be $ 50. Late check out? Same.  If you're above the 20th floor better budget up to a 15 minute wait for an elavator. And hell awaits those with animal dander allergies. Decades of visitors for the Westminster and other animal pageants make this place a severe challenge to breathe in. Getting our train to the airport was a breeze though.;3
Top location mid town where you want to be. The rooms are clean if not a little tired. If you ride the lifts you will notice a number of the floors have been turned over to some form of student hostel / university accommodation. Which whilst nothing against students seeing pad locked Room doors from  the lift is not what you expect from a 4  Star Hotel. Effectively not a 4 star hotel when compared to other 4 star hotels I have stayed in in New York it is cheaper than the others I have stayed in but not by much.  Overall good location and clean;3
We have just returned from 5 nights and had a wonderful stay. Firstly when we checked in , our room was apalling - tiny, tiny window, view of a wall, wallpaper hanging off the wall and the safe didn't work !  As we'd booked it 9 months in advance and was for special birthdays coming up , we were so disappointed.  We complained at reception and were kindly upgraded free of charge to a fabulous room with a view of empire state building and Madison square gardens. So it's worth complaining !! Lol Other than that the hotel is great, in a great location , 5 mins walk to Macy's , further 5 min walk to Empire State building and 10 min walk in other direction to Times Square.  Madison Square Gardens right outside so great for a Knicks game.  Tick Tock diner was nice but quite expensive;5
Very handy location for Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, mid-town subway etc. Nice quality hotel. Not cheap, but what is in New York, so good if you don't mind spending a bit more for a better location.;4
We treated ourselves to queen suite rooms and boy was it work it. We had 2 rooms on the 38th floor. Great views. 1 room had views of Empire State and Chrysler building and the other faced Downtown with a great view over Hudson River, World Trade Tower and even the Statue of Liberty in the distance.  Rooms are a great size with 2 TVs. Lounge area, coffee machine and fridge. Separate bedroom with comfy bed and nice linen. Rooms 3806 (Empire State view) and 3803 (downtown) Breakfast in the Tick Tock Diner was a great way to start each day.  Thanks New York and New Yorker. We will be back.;5
Stayed here with my wife and two children for 4 nights over the Halloween break. Lovely hotel. Staff very courteous and professional, especially Mohammed at check in. The room was very comfortable and cleaned regularly. The only slight disappointment was there was no bath only a shower in the ensuite. The hotel is in a great location in midtown, nearby attractions include Times Square, Macy's, The Empire State Building, Madison Square Gardens, The Vessel and the Highline. Had a nice dinner in the Tick Tock diner in the hotel.We will stay here again on our next trip !;4
"I booked this hotel for one night during a quiet week and arrived early hoping a room was available for early check-in.  Desk confirmed they did in fact have rooms ready, but that there is a $50 ""early check-in fee""!  I have traveled around the world and stayed in countless hotels and have NEVER been asked to pay a fee for early check-in, even in the famous ripoff town of Vegas.  I decided to store my bags and avoid the fee, and found the hotel charges $5 PER BAG to store bags for their guests!  Finally, upon check-out I noticed a ~$35 ""resort"", or ""destination"" fee (can't remember exactly what they called it).  I know these added fees, which are not made clear at time of booking are becoming more common...but still a clear ripoff.  It is no wonder AirBnB is taking so much";1
Couldn’t fault the location of this hotel, next to Maddison Square Garden, Empire State and also the Subway. Only problem we had with the hotel was $5 to store luggage after check out and also a communication issue when I was advised an upgrade cost of $153 and it ended up being more which I had to pay which was $272 total;4
Just got back from New York. This was our first visit to New York and stayed at the New Yorker. This hotel is in a brilliant location to get out and about from. I went with a friend and asked for twin room. We were given a massive room with two double beds and two bathrooms. The room is very dated, but was spotlessly clean. The beds were very comfortable and we were provided with thick soft white towels. There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, which was slightly disappointing, but we did take our own travel kettle, which we used. They provide shampoo, conditioner and moisturiser, but no shower gel, which I found odd, as I would have preferred shower gel to moisturiser. John at hotel concierge was brilliant. He always had a smile and gave us directions and help;4
Stayed here for 5 nights from 5th November. The location is fantastic very easy to get everywhere either walking or subways. The rooms as small but clean. Bathroom could do with upgrading but you don’t go to New York to sit in your room. Staff we encountered were all nice and friendly. View from our room was amazing! Would definite return if go back to New York.;5
this Hotel is in a great location.  Rooms are small but most are in NY.  Lobby nice but after you get past that this hotel needs a lot of renovation.  Going to the room the walls and carpet are drab and dimly lit.  Not at all welcoming.  They did not have our room ready when we got there (we were early) but they said if they did we could get in for ANOTHER $50.  We took our bags to the bell hop and that cost $5 a bag no matter the type of bag.  It is a shame when you pay so much for a room that all of that cost even more.  PATHETIC.  Staff was good.  Tick Tock diner was below average.  Have been there before but food was below average and the staff were not friendly at all and borderline rude.;3
"Reasonable midtown hotel convenient to Penn Station, the subway lines.  There may not be a more convenient location in the city.   Like other Wyndham hotels, this is not as bad as the bad reviews nor as good as the top reviews. First the gripes: Now way this is a four star.  No real sense of service, always a mobbed front lobby, aged hallways, small rooms with no coffee makers or bathroom shelf space, old tub fixtures and huge ""facility"" fee. Mandatory $34.08 per day for ""free"" internet, gym and business center.  So you're getting a 3 star (maybe 3.5 on a good day) hotel for well over 2 Benjamins a day.   The better part: Redone lobby with several restaurants and bars attached. A mildly interesting museum on the when this was a grand hotel. The fixtures in the bedroom and bath,";4
Possibly the worst hotel we have ever stopped in. We paid for an upgraded room which was awful. The room was tiny, the toilet had feaces marks in it, the skirting boards were rotten and falling off. We reported it to the reception who were extremely rude and unwilling to help. A great city with an awful hotel carrying it's name.;1
We loved our stay! Very clean & beautiful hotel. The security was great & the help from the staff was amazing! We would definitely stay again if we come back to the city. The location is perfect for walking to all the sites & shopping. Just a stones throw to Maddison square garden! Great place for sure.;5
We stayed in the New Yorker whilst visiting for the New York marathon. The staff were always friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and tidy, the only thing I would say that is missing would be a kettle. The location is great for visiting all the local attractions as you can walk to pretty much everything. The bars and restaurants located within the hotel are also excellent. A great hotel well worth a visit.;5
Modernise heating in bedroom        Sensitive shower cream           Location  location   location  is the Hotel . Everybody very courteous and friendly towards customers.  Small bar on ground floor would be nice.  Standard wi- fi in bedroom very weak. Air vent in bedroom wanted. Other than that  everything could not be better.;5
I love my Wyndham points and rewards. I’ve traveled to Wyndham Resorts across the country and I’m never dissatisfied. Florida, Newport, New Orleans, Nashville, Las Vegas, Sedona, I could go on and on! But I live in the suburbs of New York and also love Manhattan. It is always a very special weekend to reserve a night or two at The New Yorker. Clean, convenient, upscale, and in the middle of it all! Fabulous!;5
Stayed in room 2109 October 21-23. What a great experience in this beautiful and historic art deco building. The staff was professional, security at the door and elevator was on point. The room was very retro classy with an extremely comfortable bed and bedding. Yes, the the bathroom is small but stylish and has everything needed. This room boasted 3 windows looking toward the Hudson.. Great views. Coffee bar and pastries every morning was great at the lobby location and it was fun to see and listen to travelers from other countries enjoy as well. The location is perfect for bus, subway, times square, Macy's, Madison Square Garden etc. Truly a NYC experience all around.;5
This was our second visit to the New Yorker Hotel, the first being some years ago when a power outage hit the whole of the Eastern seaboard. This visit was less tense! The hotel is famous for being the last home of the scientist, Tesla. There is a plaque on his room...3327...and an exhibition in the basement. The hotel exudes Art Deco splendour in the public areas, while the rooms retain a sort of faded beauty. People return time and time again...we've already made reservations for our next trip...and it is easy to see why...it's built for comfort, in a great location, the staff are friendly and helpful...may she long reign as the Grande Dame of Manhattan!;5
great location, awesome staff who go out of their way to make you comfortable - great diner attached to the hotel, Art Deco decor - great security you need to show your key to access the elevator to the rooms.  Concierge was super helpful and patient.;5
One of the worst things about this hotel besides the inadequate rooms, terrible bathrooms and depressing decor is the rude staff at the reception desk. Whenever you need to engage with them for anything they act as if you’re a bother. I asked about why our wifi said that we were only getting 200 mb of internet per day after paying an exorbitant $45 resort fees which states fast internet on their site. The person at reception said he didn’t know, so he went to ask his manager and he didn’t know either. So he gave me the number of the internet provider they use and said I could call them and ask if I want to! Unbelievable.  My son’s suitcase was lost in LA but was found and was arriving in NY the next day. When I went to ask if it had arrived the disinterested reception worker;1
Great location, very near Penn Station with easy access to Newark Liberty Airport. Our room was clean but in need of updating. Did try to upgrade to one of the refurbished rooms but all were fully booked. Good facilities but a very busy lobby, quite manic wouldn’t suit someone looking for relaxing stay. Would recommend for a short stay.;4
Stayed here March 2019. Hotel right across from Madison Square Garden. Diner attached to hotel a wonderful place to eat breakfast.  Diner open 24/7. Hotel is half block from Penn Station so if arriving by train you only have to drag your suitcases half block to hotel. Art Deco style of hotel;5
Spacious lobby, top-notch security, very gracious staff.  I liked that you had to show room key to get access to elevators.  Room was tastefully appointed closet.  Outstanding bar in the basement.  Nice location, walkable to either Penn Station or Hudson Yards.;4
I stayed at the New Yorker during a weekend of shopping and Broadway shows in Manhattan and believe it’s a good choice for a short trip. The price is ok and the location is just great nearby Times Square.  Service is good and quite quick compared to other others in the same neighborhood. You do not wait so much of time for the check-in and check-out.  The rooms are comfortable, although a bit old, but this goes with the affordable price.;4
We stayed here for four nights the hotel is in a great location staff were helpful and friendly room was very clean and comfortable tick tock diner is on ground floor of hotel we used it every day food and service was excellent also there are two other restaurants in the hotel our first time to New York hopefully if we return we wouldn't hesitate to use the New Yorker again.;5
"This hotel is located right across from Madison Square Garden. Excellent locale.  Huge, historic, iconic building! That said, it’s costly ($262/night equates to $873 for 2 nights, then hotel charged an “amenity” fee of $45/night on top of the $873 upon check in) there are no amenities outside of a gym. Coffee pot in room=$$surcharge mini-frig=$$surcharge... so a metro room comes with NOTHING! Also: no room service. Small rooms. Metro room too small for 2 people. No fan in bathroom. Dated decor. Bathroom needed major upgrade and was a sardine can size. I was on 37th floor in room 3724; Views were stellar. Location is stellar. Comfort is mediocre.  Front desk staff was kind, but only 1-2 people ever there for so many rooms=long waits... that all being said: I would stay again for";4
Had a interesting ride from JFK in minibus last on coach to be dropped off traffic nightmare but saw quite a bit of the surrounding area. Hotel has a lot off character we are on 28 floor lift look old but the workings must be new as they are quick the room are small but fine for us bath small but original fixtures if your over 5.10 take a shower prices for basics are exspecive so take note we paid 2 dollars for a small czn of coke not the normal uk size beds comfortable can hear some noise from next door rooms and the TV was rubbish but that was no major issue 3 dont drink water from hotel placed in rooms as you can see quite expensive.apart from these moans a must visit at some time and don't forget walking shoes;4
"This is an older hotel that is clearly being renovated in some aspects. The room sizes are incredibly tiny, as well as the bathroom. Don’t expect to fit 2 people in the bathroom to get ready because that isn’t going to happen. The room was clean and tidy, however, there was a lot of damage (for instance: broken ceramic tiles, holes in curtains) from previous guests that was clearly never repaired. Things like this do take away from the quality of the room. There is NO seating in the room other than the bed and one desk chair; if you’re having guests come to your room to hangout with you, this is very inconvenient and uncomfortable. The view from our room on the 8th floor was nothing spectacular, just the back side of another building looking into other peoples rooms - definitely";3
amazing hotel with very friendly staff  old and dated but this is what adds to the charm   situated on 8th Avenue the hotel is very busy the lobby is steeped in nostalgia with a huge chandelier and old photos do the roaring 20s  there is actually a museum underneath the hotel that has lots of photos of Al Capone and what the hotel looked like in the 20s  our room was on one of the top floors and the view was breath taking you could see for miles   we flew into Newark airport and it was so easy to then get the rail right to 8 th Ave  very cheap too   The rooms were spotlessly clean with comfortable beds We didn't eat at the hotel so sorry can't comment   considering the hotel is massive it was quiet at night   checking in was very fast no waiting  The hotel is central and getting;5
Check-in welcome was miserable & as flight got in late we couldn't have 2 rooms on same floor let alone next to each other! Think we had what is called a metro room for 3 people it was very small & totally outdated however, it was clean & beds comfy. Location was great for Penn Station Sub, Macy's & Empire State. It was pricey for what you got so I'd look to stay somewhere different if I go again!;3
Don't expect glitz but we prefer it that way. Suites are very good value, especially if you're doing something at Javits center. Restaurants in the hotel (Tick Tock and Trattoria Bianca) dependable and good value.;5
I'm baffled by some of the reviews. This hotel is fantastic and the staff are AMAZING!   We stayed for 8 nights and have to say the hotel location, staff and experience added to our wonderful trip.   Staff members Samira and Driss were fantastic. Kept an eye on us all week to make sure we were enjoying our stay and always gave us great advice and tips to improve our New York experience. Honestly they went above and beyond what they needed to. I travel and use many hotels, and I have to say their customer service was one of the best I've received in recent times. There was also a female concierge, whose name I forgot to jot down (sorry) she also gave us some unique tourist tip ideas which allowed us to see things in New York that we couldn't find from generic websites.   The;5
Very happy with the reception at this Hotel. The agent by the name of Chrystal???             was super friendly and very accommodating she went above and beyond the call of duty to check us earlier, and upgraded us to a super nice room overlooking The Empire State building. I'm partial to other Hotels, but the customer service I received will definitely have me back at this Hotel. Hotel has a nice memorabilia museum in the lower level. Also ask to see Mr Tesla's room.;5
Looks very impressive as you approach on the the street, inside it has some old world charm but not as much as you expect from the outside. We had a coffee and snack there from their snack bar and sat in the foyer. The light feature and ceiling are fantastic. It is in a great location but is probably noisy.;3
Booked and paid in full ahead of travel directly with the hotel an executive double double with a view. Room not ready on arrival which was fine as we were early, charged $5 per suitcase to store them, not impressed with that, rooms in NYC are expensive so to charge extra for storing luggage is outrageous.  Was allocated a room on 31st floor, not executive and so small you couldn’t swing a mouse in there let alone a cat. Tiny window in corner of room, certainly not a view. Back to reception and told them the room was not acceptable as not what we had booked and paid for. We were given a room in 18th floor which was an executive and did have a view...but only 1 double bed. Back to reception for 3rd time, by this time I had steam coming out of my ears. We were then told they had;2
In being charged for the first night stay, we changed cards and my debit card was refunded the money for a stay that should not have had a “deposit required”. It took 2 weeks, many calls to get my money;1
Great, location, clean hotel, good be more modern, stayed in a suite which was nice. Lifts often smelt of weed! but i guess you cant stop this from happening.  Tick Tock diner below, mcdonalds and taco bell opposite.  We wanted a kettle/coffee machine in our room, they charge $25.00/day. so we purchased a kettle for $10.00, to use during our stay.;4
Managed to get an early check in. Room was small (it is NY) but modern and clean. Lovely views towards Hudson. Bed was so comfy. Check in staff and concierge all very helpful - booked car for journey back to airport for same price as a yellow cab. Lovely art deco hotel - yes a little tired in places but still a beautiful hotel. Tick Tock diner next door very good too. Grocery shops nearby and a lovely pizza place across the road along with Starbucks. Coffee facilities in room would have been nice though. Location was really good, We normally stay nearer Times Square so it was nice to be closer to The Village etc - all walkable distance. Times Square was only about 10-15 walk. Have stayed many times in NY and would stay at this hotel again.;4
The room was clean and able to accommodate our family of 6.  We checked in early and left our bags with the hotel check ($5 per bag) until we were able to get in our room.  Someone on the hotel staff gave our terrace suite to another guest between 1 pm when we checked in and 8 pm when we returned to get a room key. (Not sure how that happened.  🤷‍♀️).  We were disappointed, but what do you do?  The hotel staff is human, too. We like the location near Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.  Overall we had a good experience here and I would stay here again.;5
Art deco hotel . but very tried from the 1st  floor upwards .colour scheme is very depressing . rooms small and pictures on website are misleading ,the photographer did a good job ,but u end up being disappointed. limited information in the rooms , large reception area but needs more seating  We had to change rooms as the suite was just to small However, the hotel receptionist was very helpful and sorted us out. Not much noise from within the hotel ,but the location is noisy even in the early hours if the morning .The city that never sleeps is a perfect description of this location;3
Booked trip to New York for a special anniversary. The hotel is a wonderful place to stay. Great location right in middle of all the action. The art deco architecture is sublime. Arrived early for check in and greeted by Mohammed who was very friendly and welcoming. On noting that it was a special birthday trip he checked us in early and found us an incredible room on 37th floor with iconic views. Thank you.;4
Very well maintained art deco gem in the heart of Manhattan! Rooms were a bit small, but very quiet and adequate for our use. Bathroom was small as well. Everything worked properly and was very clean. Only downside is there was no shelving in bathroom. Good water pressure in shower and with sink and toliet all in working order. Hair dryer worked as well. Closet was nice to have to hang clothing and store suitcases. The bed & pillow was a bit more firm than what I like but was more comfortable than other places I've stayed.  One downside was we couldn't keep the a/c fan on constantly as background noise. Room was very quiet. The little museum display downstairs was nice. It would be even more ideal if there was an opportunity for a tour of the hotel where the tunnel, ballrooms,;4
Great location, friendly staff. I believe it was a really great value for what I had seen as other locations. Loved the art deco in the lobby and halls. 3 restaurants that looked really interesting but i was traveling with a picky 9 year old so didnt get to explore them;4
Great location.  All staff were very friendly and helpful.  Easy check in and out.  Would like mini fridge in room.  Had a great view of the city from our room. Beds comfortable. Would definitely stay here again.;4
My room was small, but nicely decorated and well maintained. My room faced the street, and was on the noisy side at night. There was always a person on duty to see room cards before anyone could get on an elevator.;5
My famjly and i during our visit.We stoped this place for 3 nights more than a year ago.I got a warm services from those staffs and and my family was also happy when we leave the hotel.It was amazing and fantastic being there.Thanks.;4
The lobby and other public areas reflect the architectural style in which the hotel was built, and are very well kept.  The rooms are small but efficient.  Every employee we encountered was pleasant, helpful, professional and welcoming.  The diner is - well, a diner.  It's cheap and perfectly adequate for a quick bite.  The Italian restaurant is quite nice.  We didn't try the pricey steakhouse so I can't comment on that.  I can tell you that the location of this hotel can't be beat!  It's right next door to the train station and one subway line, and just a block from another.  We highly recommend The New Yorker.;5
Seriously, it's a terrible hotel. I stayed here for a work trip as it was in a good location but that's about the last good thing about this place. There's a big difference between having a vintage aesthetic and simply having old furniture and decor. Long lines in lobby. Understaffed front desk. No concierge to speak of. Guests always have show key card to rude attendants. Elevators slow and stinky. Hallways are musty, worn and dim. Room key worked half the time (made many trips back down to front desk to wait in line). Carpets are disgusting - at least a couple decades old. Chair is even worse.  Old and stained, definitely did not want to sit in the stanky ass thing. Lighting is real bad - like staying in an old 80's Beijing apartment. Water pressure was amazing though. No;1
New Yorkers get a bad rap! This is my second trip to NYC and this time I brought my husband and sons. Everyone in this hotel was kind and helpful to my family. We received an upgrade to a room with a balcony. The view was absolutely breathtaking. The beds were comfortable and the room was spacious and clean. The hotel overall has a historic feel to it and it was walking distance to Times Square. We really enjoyed our visit. Thank you for giving my boys an amazing experience!!!;5
Stayed here for a family holiday. Good location - we walked to most places and right by subway for trips further afield. However decor very tired and could do with a refresh. Facilities also mediocre - had to pay extra for a fridge, no tea making facilities and had to pay to leave luggage on last day - have never had to do that even in budget hotels I’ve stayed in before! Would look elsewhere if we came to NY again.;3
We stayed for 4 nights in October, booked as a package holiday with Virgin, on arrival at the hotel we were told our reservation couldn’t be found, we stood there for a long time while an abrupt woman on reception disappeared with our passports, eventually came back and said they had booked us in for last year same dates and we were down as no shows. We booked a package holiday and our flights were correct so clearly this wasn’t our fault however we were treated as though it was. We were advised they needed to put a $300 hold on my credit card for a new room and for the inconvenience we would be upgraded. Went up to our room on the 25th floor, if that room and floor was an upgrade I would have hated to see where we were originally booked, as soon as you step out of the lift the;1
"Does not seem like a 4-star hotel at all. The staff was rude to us and housekeeping never changed out anything despite us removing the ""do not distrub"" sign. Bathroom had zero counter space, TV did not face the bed, one of the lights was burned out, and there were not outlets on one side of the bed. At least the location is good.";1
I don’t normally leave reviews but felt I had to this time, yes it is old but that is why we stayed there, not because it is cheap, but it was in the long run, I cannot fault this hotel, we stayed in a sweet yes the decor wasn’t new but the views made up for that, as for the staff they were top notch absolutely fab, from the guys that checked your key before you went to the lift, the reception girls I say girls because it was the girls who looked after us, and also the girls in tick tok diner. Thank you everyone there for a wonderful stay. I would just like to say a thank you to the wonderful characters of New York as well for an absolutely great holiday in your wonderful city. THANKYOU;5
Stayed here for family holiday, good location, room clean but very old fashioned, but really annoyed to be charged for left luggage on last day. Five dollars per item (our bags were small, but five in total - so twenty five dollars). This on top of paying over one hundred and thirty dollars in taxes. Prior to staying here, after booking, called to confirm reservation and were told twice they couldn’t find our booking. In a saturated market, this just isn’t good enough, definitely would not stay at a Wyndham hotel again. Would not recommend.;1
This hotel is an icon within itself. Check out the little hotel museum in the lower basement!  Yes it is old as it is the same age or older than the Empire State Building!  You are not going to find modern luxury at this hotel but the rooms are clean and beds are comfortable.  Our room was on the small side but you are in NYC, you do not spend time in your room. Checkin staff were lovely and as it was our anniversary searched for a room with a view, which ended up being on 36 floor!   Location of the hotel is excellent with subway stops surrounding it. Short walk to ESB, MSG and Hudson Yards. We received a complementary breakfast on the morning of our anniversary, food was ok, but the restaurant was very busy. I would recommend this hotel for a short stay in the city if you want;4
The New Yorker is a beautiful old hotel. The location is good, close to subway and train stations, time square is a 5 minute walk away. We visited in February so it was freezing cold outside and always a relief to walk back into the lobby. The hotel is huge but the rooms are small (as all rooms in New York are) on the higher floors you can see the empire state building;5
Our room, the most basic one offered at this hotel, was very clean, and good-sized for a hotel in NYC. We've stayed here before, and got a much smaller room, but this one has an alcove with a desk in it, and does not feel cramped at all. Convenient to Broadway. The parking garage is on 34th Street, which gets closed at rush hour, so we had to go elsewhere for parking. There are plenty of other places nearby. The Tic Toc Diner next door was great for breakfast.;4
"If you are looking for a rude and threatening checking in please go to the Wyndham New Yorker. It was definitively the worst reception I ever had in a hotel. At our check in, the staff literally took the credit card off my hands, charged me twice the amount and then when I asked him he started to yelling with us, threatening us in a way I have never seen in any hotel. I had to call my bank to cancel the one of the double charge. Despite the rude and threatening reception, I would also mention that the hotel charge you a ""resort"" fee of U$ 39, despite absolutely nothing is offered for this service (not even a small fridge or even a single coffee). Overall, I would never recommend this rude place. It will ruin your beautiful and nice trip to NYC.";1
Rooms are old, dated and small. Corridors look like something out of 1920's movie. Totally disappointed in Wyndham for even trying to pass this hotel off a 4 star's. I did not expected to be given three different room keys to find a room that was suitable to me as a member and timeshare owner.;2
"Was traveling in for a Rangers game, and wanted to try something new I haven't stayed at before. From booking.com their price for a ""Queen with a view"" wasn't horrible, so decided to book.   The Good: Location. Between MSG, shopping, Times Square, etc... great, central, place to be. Not far from subway to getting around is simple. The view. Holy moly. The view (37th floor) was uh-maze-ing. I stay in the city, usually, a few times a year and this was probably the best view I've had of the skyline. Splurge the extra few bucks for the view, if you have the chance.  The staff. Was very friendly. Wifi was good. No issues when I was using it in lobby or in the room. The bed. I slept well.   The Average: The room size. Typical NYC room. Not spacious, but didn't need it. If I were";4
If you want to stay in the heart of Midtown, this is a great option. Right next to Penn Station and across the road from the Staples centre, makes it easy access to get around Manhattan. We were not happy with the room we were allocated and we had to negotiate to get a better room. I think this is something they do to up sell, so I was not happy about that, however we did get a great room. Tic Tok the restaurant is good for breakfast and although the decor of the bat is horrific. Food, drinks and service was top notch. It’s hit and miss with the staff. The majority are excellent, there was just one very unfriendly attendant as you access the elevators and she knows who she is;4
The hotel is in a great location, but it’s very outdated, especially the bathrooms. I don’t think I’ve seen bathrooms that looked as old as these. The single queen room is extremely small, also. This is a 4-star hotel, so I expected much nicer and more updated rooms for the cost.;3
"We used this hotel for our first trip to NYC for 3 nights. As stated in other reviews, you really cannot get a better location for a ""home base"" for NYC sightseeing. We were able to get to almost any place we wanted to see, via Subway or walking, rather quickly by starting from this hotel. It is an older, historic hotel & it shows but that is also the ambiance of it. Do not expect modern, luxury, futuristic decor/ammenities when staying at this hotel. Our room, a metro view standard room facing the Hudson, was small (we have had cruise cabins that were larger!), as well was the bathroom, but that is to be expected with this type/age of hotel. The room was very clean & quite, as was the bathroom. The bathroom also had nice, quality Bumble & Bumble ammenties stocked in it for our";4
This hotel is a very historical property going back to 1919. The lobby has been updated and they've done a good job to make it friendly and presentable. However, once you go into the ballroom, or event rooms or even the elevators, you realize that this is a real estate fixer upper. Carpets are old, rooms smell musty, molding and wallpapers look worn and dated. Wyndham should invest in this gem. Shame they are letting it fall apart. It's only redeeming quality is that it is a block away from MAdison Square Garden.  Don't eat the food - absolutely disgisting;3
In general the experience was fine, nice views and the room was nice. I think they should fix the toilet, because it looks really old. But the employees are rude, mostly on the reception. It is very sad that in a nice hotel, the people working there, don't respect you as they have to.;1
"This hotel is positioned really well, right next to Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens. You do have to pay a ""resort/property"" fee upon checking in, but the value for the location is quite good. Wi-fi throughout as well as pretty large fitness center in the basement of the hotel available for use. We checked in late at night due to our flight delays, we arrived around 2am and check in was easy.  We took the train into Manhattan from JFK to Penn Station without a problem. We were able to walk to our Boradway Shows, Times Square, Central Park without a problem. You can also take the subway easily and cheaply to all of these destinations as well as the rest of Manhatten and the boroughs.";4
You can feel the glory of the past, but the present condition is less impressive... The rooms look old. The view from the top floors is great and the location is very central and close to everything...;3
We visited the New Yorker Hotel to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday. I shared this with Mohammad at the time when he was checking us in. To our delight we were given an upgrade to a suite in the newly refurbished business section of the hotel. An absolutely beautiful room! Thank you Mohammad for going the extra mile to make our celebrations even more memorable!;5
I really wanted to like this hotel. I love old buildings, Art Deco architecture, and was looking forward to it.  Pros-- -Excellent location -Art Deco details -Staff at check-in were friendly and efficient -Shower pressure and hot water were excellent   Know before you go: --I had read the reviews about the small rooms and they are all true. We had a Metro View Queen, and I could have reached out from the open door and touched the bed. The closet had a luggage rack, but there was nowhere to unfold it.   Cons-- -The Wyndham Resort sales pitch. This happened right after check in, when a man at what I thought was an information desk waved me over and asked if I wanted information. After a couple of minutes, we untangled ourselves and avoided that area. Another woman on a different;2
First time in New York and the New Yorker Hotel on 8th Ave. first impression,lobby etc very nice,Art Deco hotel. Hotel staff very friendly,check in took around 20 minuets having to que.As it was a birthday trip for my wife we got a free room upgrade on the 43rd floor with excellent views of New York and Hudson River in the distance. Room was something you’d expect from a 1930s film by tastefully done,very nice.Ajoining the hotel was the “Tick Tock Diner” great breakfast,staff were excellent,very funny,broad New York accents and loved to chat,loved it.

Going back next year and dining at Delmonicos restaurant,so;3
Booked an executive room with 2 double beds for $2700 for 7 nights. Was lucky enough to get a killer view of the Empire State Building from my room but oh what a price to pay for it! Location is amazing - right opp Penn station, a block from Macy’s in one direction & 2-3 blocks from Neiman Marcus in another direction, 700 mts from Empire State, 8 min walking for bus tours, great places to eat nearby, convenience stores, Starbucks & 24 hour McDonalds opp the hotel etc etc.   However, for the steep price, one would expect at least a tea/coffee maker in the room, maybe a complimentary fruit basket or cookies or at least the usual 2 bottles of water everyday but alas nothing of the sort!! Expect a basic room - executive rooms are decent sized vs a regular room (saw one from inside;3
I am Wyndham Diamond and this is the worst NY hotel I have ever stayed at. The front desk staff are amazing and made the most of what they have to offer, but the hotel itself is in DIRE NEED of an upgrade.   We stayed at the Terrence Suite and the room smelled like puke. No one was available to clean so family had to sleep in a puke smelling couch overnight until cleaning staff was available to clean.  The next day, the toilet clogged and we had to call again.  They said they would charge us $3.00 when my grandmother asked for hot water until a very nice manager saw that I was wyndham diamond and sent over complimentary water.   The rooms and bathrooms are ridiculously outdated.;1
The room is absolutely tiny and feels really old a dingy. I've had four interactions with staff during my two night stay. Three of them were noteworthy and negative. Someone on the staff scolded me in front of a group of people for trying to use the stairs after a fire alarm had just gone off at 6:30 a.m. We were given the all clear to go back to our rooms, but apparently he wasn't okay with me using the stairs and he was really rude. I was allowed access to use the stairs 10 seconds afterwards. Then, later in the day a guy let a huge number of people by to get on the elevators. He saw me and for some reason forced me to show him a room key. He also used attitude and was rude after I asked why he'd let everyone else past, but me. I called for a late check out, and the guy was;2
The location is great. Very convenient to subway station and shopping. Room was clean and bigger than I thought it would be. Now the bad.....the beds are really hard however the pillows are great. Staff is friendly but I was given terrible directions by people at the information desk twice. The bathrooms are REALLY small! A bigger person would honestly not be able to navigate these bathrooms. They charge a ridiculous $5 per bag to store your luggage if you arrive early or have a later flight. On top of that a rather high resort fee that as far as I could tell only covers WIFI.;3
The lobby is nice. Very busy. The room was OK but the bathroom needed maintenance. Old fixtures were OK but walls and tile need work. TV picture quality was poor, so don't bother. Nice view of city. Price was competitive. Very convenient location to trains. Walk to times square or hop subway to Greenwich Village. No bad odors. Hallways nice.;4
Stayed here for 5 nights as a birthday treat.  Hotel has tried to keep to all the original decor and yes it does look a bit dated in areas and could do with a coat of paint but that is part of the ambience of the building.  For a city hotel I wasn't expecting a huge room and it was perfect for my needs.  Yes, it could have done with coffee facilities in the room, but as others have said there is a Starbucks across the road. The only thing I would say they could improve on is check-in.  There was always a queue when I passed through the foyer.  The staff could be a bit more helpful on the desk.  The people in front of me got all the advice they needed, I got- 'here's  your key and this is the Wi-Fi code' The concierge and door man were very helpful.   Tick tock diner only used;4
Really looked forward to staying at the New Yorker. Iconic hotel and highly rated - it was bound to be good!!  We arrived early, we got into NYC at 11am so made our way to the hotel and arrived at the hotel at 1ish. Knew we couldn’t check in till 4pm so asked where we can leave our bags. I wasn’t expecting a $5 per bag charge, and it’s $5 even for a carrier bag. Doesn’t matter if you attach it to your suitcase they still charge you for it. That was very disappointing to see. I’ve traveled a lot and never been charged to leave suitcases.   We went off around NYC and returned about 4:30. Reception was busy, the “trainee” who was stood watching didn’t crack any sort of smile. Shrugged her shoulders when asked a question.  Herbert however we spoke to and dealt with was excellent.;3
Had a lovely 2 night break here. Great location, very central. The hotel is like going back in time and I'm sure it was very grand once upon a time. The rooms need updating and the bathroom facilities are to be desired. I managed to set the fire alarm off after the room filled with steam after an attempt at getting the shower to a usable temperature. The shower/bath was at least 30 years old and in need of updating. Despite this we would stay again as the location was spot on and we didn't spend much time in the hotel itself.;4
This is the second time we stayed at the New Yorker. My wife and I came in March and we brought out 3 kids back in Oct.   The hotel is conveniently located if you want to walk or take the subway.   Will stay here again when in Manhattan.;5
Location is great.  Subway access was just across the street and hotel is also close to theater district.  Restaurant in lobby is good.  The room itself was a good size but the furnishings need to be refreshed.  Staff members were very friendly and helpful.;4
Family of 5. We stayed in a family suite at the 21st floor. Nice, clean and spacious room with plenty of storage space and a great view towards the Empire State Building. The sofa bed was missing in the room when we arrived. It was quickly dealt with by the hotel staff. Great location, great staff and we loved the room. We will certainly stay at this hotel the next time we visit New York.;5
"Had to jump through hoops twice, and until 1:00 a.m. to get my credit card cleared of pending charges that were being paid for by my business. Waited a half an hour to get checked in, while another guest was complaining about his room with a ""wet pet"" smell, and only two people checking in guests at a very small front desk. The room was very small with very poor harsh lighting. The closet couldn't be opened all the way because of the over sized desk, and there was no lighting in the closet for the safe, so had to use my phone's flashlight for that. The bathroom didn't close all the way and the glass shelf above the towels had calcified water stains on it. There was no guide for anything and the TV had a few digital channels that kept going in and out, and most channels were";1
"Rooms are small, but adequate.  Décor is outstanding, they have kept much of the 1930 special touches and the location if fantastic!  The Tick Tock restaurant in the hotel has ""out of this world"" service and food.";5
Great hotel in fabulous location.  All the staff were lovely and so helpful.  We were upgraded and had a lovely room with great views.  Would definitely recommend.  Tick Tock diner adjoining is also great with excellent service.;4
Lovely hotel,  very clean, lovely staff. Its a bit dated but I found that part of the charm.  Rooms were tiny but its what you expect for the money. Its very central with a subway station right outside it s very central and actually its walking distance to lots of places such as Empire State Building,  Intrepid museum, Maddison square gardens, Macy's etc, Broadway and Times square.;5
We stayed here in 2 rooms each with 2 double beds with kids aged 15, 14, 12 and 9. The location is great - next to Penn station, close to Times Square/Broadway. The rooms were comfortable but dated. We enjoyed our stay, and considering the cost of many NY hotels, this was pretty good.;4
Arrived 10 minutes early and tried to check in but was informed by the front desk that the confirmation # sent to me via email by booking.com was not a reservation # for the hotel. The agent at the front desk then deflected blame onto booking.com and said I should try calling the phone # on the email instead. An hour later I finally got my room. The hotel attempted to make things right by waiving the $35 charge but my mood had already turned sour for the rest of the night. I will definitely NOT be staying here again.;1
The hotel is warm and clean very busy but the front desk and staff is so kind and helpful, I love staying because everything was just what I needed   You will find many points of interest just walking a few blocks and the view from the terrace suite is so amazing and I really enjoyed fresh air and that view to the skyscrapers is unforgettable;5
This hotel is perfectly situation. The personal is wonderful.  Had a great time.  Will be returning next year for a third time...unless we can go before.  Walking distance to everything.  Did not try the restaurant.;5
Stayed there for a week. The location is perfect, the history of the hotel is great. Check in could be more personal, but anyway. We booked a suite and were satisfied. We would book again due to location. We stayed in August 2018.;4
This was my 3rd stay at this hotel and have never been disappointed.  Everyone is very helpful and friendly. I have never been made to feel like anything I asked was a bother.  Would stay here again in a minute.  I have already recommended it twice since my return home. It is very convenient to places to eat, subway and times square.;5
Fantastic stay.  Perfect.  Great staff all the way from checkin to housekeeping.  My new go-to hotel in New York.  Quiet, clean, secure.  Just all around perfect.  And the location!  I took the train and was delighted to see it was right across the street.  Great coffee bar in lobby....skip coffee in the Tick Tock tho.;5
We booked this for a 6 night break. Good location being central. Hotel room was bit dated and a little on the small side for 2 of us, to be expected. On the whole a nice hotel and staff were friendly. I was a bit disappointed that they charge $5 dollars an item to store luggage for 2 hours, they even charged $5 for a rolled up picture in a tube that was slightly to big to fit in bag. Shame my nice pleasant stay ended in this way. Apparently there is another hotel that does the same in NYC, didn’t expect this from a Wyndham hotel.;3
A great location for exploring Manhattan. The room is small and we just about managed with 4 people in the room which has 2 small double beds. The room did need a bit of attention with a few small items needing fixing, but overall not a big complaint. Nice touch are the welcome drinks in the lobby.;4
Lovely Art Deco Hotel in New York. Fantastic lobby, and the tick toc diner which is great for breakfast. Comfortable beds and the most powerful shower. No tea and coffee facilities in the room but there’s a Starbucks opposite. All in all a fantastic hotel in a fabulous location.;5
I have just returned from an amazing 4 night trip in New York but unfortunately the hotel was a huge disappointment!  The main issue at this hotel being rude front of desk staff! From the moment we arrived we had various issues which were made 10 x worse than they needed to be by the front desk & how they spoke to us. The hotel isn’t cheap so I would expect a basic level of service but it simply did not exist. The only 2 members of staff that actually made a difference was Herbert & Miss Henry (& we thank you for that!)  The rooms were old, dated & the first room we was given was so small you could hardly move, we asked to move room which we did after lots of heated discussions & managed to get a better room. The straw that broke the camels back was the fact the hotel charged us;1
The restaurant is 24 hours and that is terrific. However it isn't very good. And the wait staff aren't great either. However it does mean you can get dinner if you get in very late and tired without having to go walking around the city. The concierge is fabulous. He was so helpful and kind when I needed a taxi at 4 am. It's a classic hotel and that's nice but I thought the halls were grubby and the room was very small. However the location for me was unbeatable and I have booked to stay there again. The convenience of the 24 hour restaurant and the location trumps the room size and food quality for my purposes.;3
Classic hotel convenient to Madison Square Garden and the Pennsylvania Station.  However, room is very loud (even for NYC standards) and incredibly small, bathroom especially could stand an update and a shelf that could actually accommodate a toiletry kit. Won’t fit more than 2 people (even if it were a baby) in a queen room.;3
We had a great trip to the New Yorker. Beautiful Art Deco style. I surprised my wife with a trip to NYC from DC on Amtrak and the location is a block from Penn Street station and MSG - and we were there to Billy Joel (which I would highly recommend!). Great view of the Empire State building! The rooms are small and clean. I see people saying they're a little dated, but for me, it's what I expected...you don't go to NYC to stay in the room! There is a diner on the first floor but we didn't eat there. The staff was friendly and helpful and the price was what I expected based on the location. Great coffee, pizza and a nice Irish pub nearby...and I'm sure tons more! We would definitely stay here again for sure.;4
We stayed here on a recent trip to NYC and enjoyed our stay, mostly because it is an easy walk to Times Square and the theater district. There are also some fun bars and a great pizza spot nearby! Top floors are for college dorm living.;4
The hotel was ideally located and the room was in fair condition, we were there during the major dog show in NTC so a novel experience with pets everywhere, having said that it did nothing to detract from our stay.;4
The hotel is beautiful! Check-in was quick and they held our bags for $5/each while we strolled the city. Our room was smaller than pictured but very clean and modern. Beautiful view of the city! We took panoramic pictures from the 33rd floor multiple times during our stay. The staff was quick to assist when we didn't get the fridge we requested in the room. Water pressure was fantastic in the bathroom and I LOVE the bumble & bumble toiletries. The beds and linens were also very comfortable and you could hardly hear the noise of the city outside. We will be back next year!;4
For years, the New Yorker has been where I stay when I fly to New York preparatory to walking across the street early the next morning for the Adirondack train to Montreal. I'm now re-thinking that. This was my first stay since it became a Wyndham, and some of the problems aren't Wyndham's fault. To list the ones that are first: I was walking to the elevator when a guy behind a desk asked me if i knew about the free breakfast, which started at 9. I told him I had to be up earlier and he suggested I change my train reservation. Not going to happen. I was then given a hard sell for Wyndham resorts, which I didn't appreciate. The room was fine, but (and this isn't Wyndham's fault) construction suddenly started up, making it very hard to sleep. It stopped a 5am. Next problem might;3
We stayed here as it’s one block to Penn Station and we were going out by train the next am. Bathroom for standard room is so tiny it’s one person only. Room is tiny but bed was comfortable. And it was clean. Very busy lobby. We wouldn’t stay here again. Too old and tired with too snail of rooms for the price.;3
We stayed here for two nights before a cruise and was very disappointed. We regularly stay at a Wyndham hotel in Florida so expected this one to be good. The reception was bright and airy but the room we were given was small and cramped. The wallpaper was coming away from the wall,we reported it as soon as we saw it but nothing was done. The plumbing in the bathroom looked like it was original and very shabby. The shower was a nightmare but that was due to the very old plumbing. It was not what I would expect from a Wyndham hotel and it cast a shadow on our first visit to NewYork.;3
everything is old and rusty…  the room is empty from basic stuff   Very noisy Everything is insanely rusty and small..  Those who want to enjoy only a location come to this hole and those who do not run!!!!!!!!…;1
We had a great state at the Wyndham New Yorker. The location is excellent so close to Penn Street station which had it possible to get the airtrain from Jfk to the city instead of having to get a cab and sit in traffic. The rooms are small but clean and a little dated but for a central location this wasn't an issue as very little time spent in the room. We went for my 40th birthday and was given a room with a view of the empire state building and Maddison Square garden. Tick tock diner is attached we ate in there a few times. Lovely pizza place across the road and Cvs is opposite for drinks and snacks for the room. We would definitely stay here agai;5
The location of this hotel is really what sells it to be honest, just by Penn Station and Madison Square Garden as well as a very short walk to the Empire State Building and Times Square... perfect! The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, from the reception staff, security and cleaners. We made the mistake of paying to upgrade to a river view room which consisted of us having to crane our neck at the corner window to see a glimpse of the Hudson, certainly not worth the additional cost but you live and learn! The room itself was very stylish and modern, clean and tidy, lovely and warm after the chilly January nights with plenty of plug sockets (always necessary for the phones and battery packs). It was a shame to have to pay for them to hold your luggage after check;4
"Check in was not all that smooth,at 4:30pm,our room was not ready.We were offered 2 complementary drink vouchers to use at the bar,as well as being offered luggage storage “at no cost” for the next 2 hours while our room was made up.The staff were polite.  This hotel is in a very good location, just near Penn station and diagonally across from Madison Square Garden and an easy walk to Time Square, Broadway and other places of interest. Our room was on the 11th floor overlooking 8th Avenue; with a view to the Chrysler Building, which was lit up with Red, White & Blue lights for the Labour day weekend. It was a small room but had a super comfortable bed with great pillows, also the shower pressure very good, as was the AC. The down side to this hotel is you could smell the oldness";4
Great location - easy walk to the High LIne and to Bryant Park, NY City Library.  Guest room small but clean.  Able to open the windows which I love - fresh air is the best!  Super comfortable bed, good layout of room.  Bathroom - no walk in shower, but again, it was clean, and the shower head was great and the water hot.  Bathroom sink very small - nowhere to put make up bag.;4
We absolutely loved the New Yorker.  I doubt you could find a better location.  It's right next to a subway stop and just a short walk to another subway that gives you access to loads of different lines.  It's a relatively easy walk to Times Square and down to Hudson Yards/Highline.  The Tick Tock diner attached is also great and we started most days with a bagel around the corner on 34th street (head towards Hudson Yards).  You are also right next to Madison Square Garden.  We went to see Billy Joel there, so it was fantastic.   We had booked two rooms and both were upgraded so we had an amazing view of the Empire State Building from one window and the city from the other.  It's a beautiful old style hotel and because it's not super modern some of the features such as the;5
As soon as you step out of the elevator you feel concerned as the halls appear dirty, dated and dingy. However when you get into your room yes they are small, old and outdated but the rooms are clean and comfortable. Hotel would def be improved by the hallways being renovated. Positives were the front desk staff who gave me a choice of views and were efficient and friendly and the location. I came to NYC for a concert at Madison Sq Gardens and it is just across the road which made my life so easy. I would def stay here again.   Thank you;4
This hotel is in a good location for seeing the sights. But that’s all it has going for it. The rooms are very small, not enough wardrobe space, no tea or coffee making facilities and a dusty bathroom. I don’t think housekeeping realise the door has a back to it. We had to change rooms as ours was so dark. Don’t go to the bar as the drinks are far to expensive, 20 dollars for 2 small drinks. One guy on reception was very rude. They even charge you to leave your luggage on the day you depart.;3
Location perfect, staff is courteous and helpful, well organized and ran smoothly for a large city hotel. Room is simple but clean, meets expectations. The corridors could use a facelift. Check in was flawless and reception staff very helpful.;4
Terrific location. I could walk just about everywhere I wanted to go. I stayed on the 37th floor, had a view room, and I highly recommend it. Every staff person I came across was helpful and pleasant. The restaurants, business center and gym were fabulous as well.;5
"Great location. Close to; Penn Station, Broadway, MSG, Empire State Bldg, Al Hirschfeld theater.  Our room was clean. Bed comfort was OK, not great. Room was quite small. $300 per night. We've stayed here before. Will probably stay again.";4
Why the best----Location is in the centre of manhatton with both uptown and downtown in easy reach on foot,by bus and metro. The Hotel has been refurbished and whilst not large rooms are clean and functional,Dining: the Tick Tock 24hr Diner is he place for breakfast or fast food dining,in addition there is a trattoria and a spankng new steakhouse. Finally security is very strict --no access to lifts without valid key card. Our first choice in sensibly pticed Midtown Hotels;4
The New Yorker is central to train and tube station, just a short walk away, it is also within walking distance to many of the sites, if you like walking. But the bus station with hop on hop off bus is only a few streets away. The hotel  itself is 1930s,, but it is clean, comfortable and has everything you should need. The tick tick diner attached to the hotel is really good, not cheap, but nothing in New York is cheap. There is a very good pizza place opposite, with other eating places nearby, and a supermarket opposite. A very good stay, we would stay here again.;4
Staff is friendly and helpful, although always a wait for front desk. The hotel is very conveniently located near Penn Station, Times Square, and the Javits Center where I had meetings. The rooms are very small. So small that I asked to change to a larger room. The website does not accurately describe just how small some of the rooms are, and the queen beds are more like a full size. Nice and clean though!;4
We stayed here for several nights and were impressed. The rooms are a bit small and the bathrooms are tiny. The location is wonderful for Broadway, Madison Square Garden, Restaurant Row, Times Square, and the Diamond District. The staff were helpful and the security tight. There is a decent workout room, and a little museum chronicling the history of the hotel. There are two restaurants on the property as well.  It might could use a cleaning/upgrade, though.;4
From the checkin to checkout our experience was great. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room we booked gave us a good view of the empire state and the chrysler building. There directions from Penn st. station could have been easier, as we found an exit labelled 8th avenue and 31st street west which brings you out nearly opposite the hotel at Madison square garden.;5
"I stayed a total of 4 nights in September. I was visiting NYC with my son, and booked a double bed. Points against: double bed was way too small, so was the room; water faucets were terribly old, with the bath faucets not able to turn properly. Carpets were old too. The worst thing about this hotel is that all elevators take forever to arrive. It is an old property I appreciate, but surely the owner ought to have considered an overall renovation to make the hotel more efficient. Sole saving grace, the Tick Tock Diner, which opens 24 hours. I will not consider this property again. No matter how near is it to the Penn Station, the streets in and around this huge hotel are dirty and I see much to improve to enhance the stay for all guests.";2
As a Brit I read the reviews of this hotel prior to booking and saw majority positive but some negative reviews also that made me slightly concerned about our 8 night stay all I can report is our experience which was very positive. We arrived after a long flight and long delays through JFK to a warm greeting at reception (this was approx 2:30 pm, they were fully booked and advised our room wasn't available yet but they would try and get it ready asap so we had a quick snack in tick tock (diner attached to hotel) we came back out at about 3:30 and reception said our room was ready. We asked for a fridge fully aware that they are not provided as standard.  They advised they would hold $45 deposit per day against my credit card  which would be refunded at the end of our stay, they;5
The Hotel is old and not comfrotable at all We booked with booking.com fpr 8 nights of stay and we really have a bad stay  We booked 4 rooms with view x 8 nights Our room was so tony that we could not enter woth our bagagges and from the moment that the elevstor opened up you can smellthe old and dirty carpet  The common area walls are dirty the carpet broken the rooms doors scratched and dirty  When we arrived at our room we find the room dorty and the bathroom woth a used and wet soap and towel! I was so disappointed that i went immediatly at the lobby amd the front desk employee was very rude but after my compliants called the manager Manager was responsive and changed our 4 rooms to a remodeled floor but 2 of therooms were very very tiny and the other 2 regular size and no;1
This is my fourth visit in less than two years to NYC. The New Yorker for me is the only place I want to stay. Having had an easy but long travel day I arrived around 7.30pm and was greeted by a lovely lady who's name I did not get. We had a pleasant conversation and had told her that this was a gift to myself having had successful treatment for cancer. I asked if they had any upgrades and was delighted to be offered a small suite for a small extra sum that I was more than happy to pay. I was also given a drink voucher to enjoy at The Tick Tock Diner, which I did. The suite was fantastic. Large lounge with a settee and two chairs, a fridge and sink unit, coffee machine, pods water and soft drinks. Large bedroom, comfortable bed, crisp linen and a view of Manhatten with the;5
Came to New York for the weekend and needed to add an extra night last minute. Our original hotel wanted to charge us an outrageous sum, this hotel was much more affordable for the add on.   The Art Deco architecture is classic for manhattan. It’s location is pretty Awesome right across from Madison square garden, a fair walk from Times Square.   They had no hotel parking but did validate for a discount at a nearby garage (50/night - expensive but it’s manhattan)   The rooms were small! We did request an upgrade (which they invited us to do) but were declined. We opened the door to our room and almost laughed. It was actually impossible for my husband and I to stand in the doorway with our luggage at the same time and not already be touching the bed. Space was VERY tight!;4
Great location and great hotel. Room was bigger than expected. Could use a better mattress, but that is minor. Close to subway and many top attractions. Would definitely recommend. I'll be staying there again.;5
We stayed two nights on the 21st floor. Our room was quiet and comfortable. The lobby and public spaces are old deco beautiful. The hallway wallpaper and carpets could really use an update, but the room was great .;4
My boyfriend and I were very interested in making a one week booking and before doing so had a few questions to be answered. We phoned the hotel and got through to the reservations who couldn't answer our questions so passed us through to the Front Office. The transfer wasn't made properly so we got disconnected and had to call again (have in mind that we are calling fron Switzerland...).  When we finally manage to get through to the reception, we spoke to a woman who got aggitated because she too could apparently not answer our very straight forward question. She wanted to transfer us to Revenue Management but after waiting about 7mins on the line she picked up again and had no answer. She then got agitated and used an extreamely unfriendly tone and started accusing me of;1
This hotel is ideally located for getting around NYC. Trains, subways & busses easy to ride from Penn Station. Hotel is newly renovated. Small rooms but clean & comfy. The 2  Restaurants have great food for a reasonable price. Tic Tick Diner for breakfast/lunch all day & Italian Bistro for dinner. Staff, especially concierge are friendly & very helpful.;5
The service wonderfully nice  Staff excellent  Service ASAP when ever you call front desk  They check customers for there room keys protection I thought was awesome  Thanks again,would recommend to all who visit New York  Not my first time but my up grade was wonderful that they offered.;5
It's a mediocre property with bite-sized rooms, but centrally located. Not to go for their breakfast package as you only get a toast and coffee! But their Tick Tock all-day dining restaurant serves quintessential American cuisine. Calling guest services is like dialing a customer service center that just rings and rings. In short, if all you care about is location, location and location, then the New Yorker is the hotel to be checked in.;3
The hotel is an excellent location close to all the main sites. The hotel photos may give the impression that this is a modern hotel but it is not. The elevators, long winding hallways make this immediately evident. You will realise that the hotel does need a major refurbishment including replacement of all doors and bathrooms.  The room size was very small, probably the smallest hotel room we (a family of four)  have ever stayed in but the room decoration is pleasant and the beds are comfortable. The magnetic key card system used it outdated and very inconvenient because it loses it code whenever you place it next to other devices. We had  to have the key cards re-programmed on a number of occasions.  The reception staff was friendly and conceirge and porters always ready to;3
Stayed here for the second time for a 5 night visit. The bedroom is in need of an upgrade especially the bathroom which looked very tired. Bed was comfy though and the location is great. Staff at check in were nice but others we encountered, security guard and especially the lady with the toilet key were extremely rude. I get the New York abruptness I’ve visited the city too many times to remember and have experienced it all but the staff here are just rude.;3
This is a lovely hotel our room was very clean and the Tick Tock Diner was perfect for eating and drinks at very reasonable prices. The only downside was the noise from outside there seemed to be building work going on all through the night drilling and machinery plus sirens from either ambulance or police cars blaring out even though roads were pretty empty. Paid extra for a room with a view which looked out over Penn station which was a waste of money but didnt spil our break;3
This was our second stay at the New Yorker. The first was fabulous, not as great this time, but I’ll get to that later. The hotel is in a great location for visitors to NY. If you arrive by train, penn station is only across the road. The blue line subway is just around the corner and the red subway line is just a block away. 10min walk to the high line, 15mins to Times Square.  The hotel has a 24hr diner downstairs and a bar and steakhouse attached also. There is a fitness centre downstairs, but if you’re doing sightseeing, you should be too buggered to use it!  The staff aren’t the happiest bunch, but were happy to help me out when I had some questions. The hotel looks like it needs some TLC. The floor we were on, the hall way carpets looked very worn. The bathroom ceiling;3
Update:  Still waiting for a credit regarding being charged twice on two credit cards for July 13.  The Hotel has stopped communicating with us even after I submitted copies of the overage charge.  Were now going through our credit card company.;1
Very good hotel. The location was perfect for all the main sightseeing, rooms a little on the small side could  have done with a bit more storage space, but clean and comfortable. Very nice bar downstairs and the tick tock resraurant very good. Staff friendly and helpful.Would stay there again.;4
Stayed here for 5 nights in September 2019.  The room we had was a double queen room so that our daughter could share with us. The beds were definitely not Uk sized queen beds, more like 3/4 doubles. The room was clean and a reasonable size for New York. No fridge, minibar or coffee making facilities though. The hotel has a nice lobby with the Tick Tock diner attached. We used the diner a few times and the food etc was fine, very handy when returning tired after a whole day out sightseeing. There is also an Italian and a steakhouse attached which we didn’t try. Check in was quick, the staff member didn’t really take much time to talk to us or point out any features of the hotel, just really ‘here’s your key and the lifts are over there’.  I had contacted them in advance to tell;3
Regadigg this hotel, the location is great, just next to Penn Station, subway, just a few blocks from the Empire State Building.  Once you check out, you can store your luggage for a $5 US per bag.  This is a good option.  What I didn't like about this hotel, is that I believe is overpriced.  The rooms are outdated, bathrooms are really small.  Room decoration is depressing and outdated.  The hidden fees!!.  Be aware of it.  they will charge you a hidden fee for internet use, even if you don't use it.  Overall, if look for location.  You wont spend time at the hote, and you don't need amenities.  It is ok;3
I stayed only one night over Christmas. It is not my type of hotels usually, but, I had a $50 Expedia coupon, and since The New Yorker is one of Expedia's +VIP Access™ hotel, I was able to double the value of my points! plus 15% off one night stay. So I booked one Queen bedroom, and the total paid was $93.45. (Look for good hotel offer )  - The hotel location was alright. I personally prefer to be closer to Time Square. - I got there during the peak of check-in time, and the line was long. Check-in was convenient and staff was ok. - The room was small but clean. The bed wasn't bad either. - Complimentary WiFi.;3
Just across the street from Penn station and Madison Sauare garden. Great staff and clean rooms. We were lucky to have a newly renovated room on the 30th floor. 10-15 min walk to Times Square too. Great to have a 24 hour diner at the bottom of the hotel, serving traditional American food.  Retro hotel with interesting history, would definitely stay her again. Thank you The New Yorker, we can’t wait to come back!;5
Stayed in the New Yorker for 7 nights from September 10th through to September 17th. I absolutely loved it. The staff were friendly and super helpful. The room size was average, but we had a fantastic view of the Empire State Building from our window. The hotel is very central and Times Square,  42nd Street and Fifth Avenue are all within walking distance.  There's a subway on the corner that takes you uptown to 911 memorial etc.  Overall, a fantastic stay and I'm looking forward to staying here again in the future.;5
Spent a week at this hotel. Great location, but tired building and tired staff. My card did not work to get in. There was a lot of noise that travelled well into my space. My room was not cleaned one of the days. Waited for 1.5 hrs to get a fresh towel, after 3 phone calls and a visit to the lobby. The following day, another traveler walked into my room, as he was assigned the room I was in. I was just out of the shower and naked at the time, so a tad inconvenient. I needed to use the business office but my key did not work, had to wait for 15 mins in line to get my key authorization to the business center. When I went in, the computers were antiquated and the printers did not work. I left and came back later, but they had no paper to print. I reported it and after an hour, I;2
Booked 7 nights here to celebrate our wedding anniversary so booked a room with a view. On check in we were told the room had a fabulous view so imagine our disappointment on entering the room to find a view of an office opposite. The room was also quite small. Staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay as hotel is also very well located with easy access to metro and many areas on foot.;3
So location is great- very close walking distance to lots of attractions and right next door to Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Station.  The hotel reception is very grand but once you get beyond the lifts the hotel is tired and in need of refurb. We had a queen terrace room on 22nd floor which was very spacious with double room with ensuite and lounge area with terrace and another bedroom off it. The terrace was huge but to be honest we didn't use it much. The air conditioning is good and quiet.   The downside of this hotel is its size and the lack of customer service. No staff (apart from housekeeping) were particularly friendly. Check in was very short and abrupt and i think its odd you have to pay for luggage hold ($5 per piece)- maybe if they do away from all the wasted;3
I stayed in this hotel with my friend for 5 nights. This accommodation has the perfect location, lot of landmarks are a walk distance. The problem is that there’s absolutely no service! First of all, the night when we arrived (Saturday) we had to wait almost 1 hour to be checked in because there was only one agent at the front desk. Check-in itself were not informative at all. No explanation about services offered, facilities, restaurants, nothing. Bellmen were not available neither. Room are small but clean and with a nice view. There’s no fridge. Bathroom very small. At the check-out they charge you with additional fees for they stay and for keeping your luggage in the bellman room. Overall this is a good hotel but from a 4-star hotel I expected a higher level of service,;2
Considering age of the property, was pleasantly surprised by overall quality and appearance. The exercise room was definitely an upside surprise. Liked the little museum in the corridors adjacent to the exercise room. Hallways on the guest floors are a little run down, but everything else is in pretty good shape.;5
The grand old lady of Manhattan.  The hotel is well run with professional, obliging staff.  The rooms are well appointed and comfortable.  This property is the perfect location for those on business in the mid or downtown areas - close to the magor subway lines and Penn Station for Amtrak.  The downside is the noise.  It is non-stop traffic with Police, Ambulance and Fire Services sirens blaring every 30 minutes or more!  I suggest numerous cocktails before attempting to sleep.  Still it is the centre of NYC, so it is what it is.;4
My first time staying in New York!  Very good hotel.  My room was standard but nice.  Bed very comfortable but a few concerns:::damp on closet floor and light toilet noise first night.  After a long day of touring and on second evening toilet wouldn't stop flushing..just aweful....called front desk and every number on room phone but no answer.  I called 1-800 fir reservation who was kind enough after hearing my story to transfer me to local hotel reservation who was able to get someone to the phone.  While out of room it was fixed. I did not find too many bellman friendly.  They could smile and greet guest whether helping with luggage or not!  Bed very comfortable and hotel directly across street from Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens...I came in on the Amtrak train so;4
If you’re a tourist and want to experience old NY and stay in one of the noisiest, busiest, dirtiest parts of the city this is for you. The building is historic and you can see how it would have been in its heyday in the 1950s. But it’s now  dirty, old, walls are water damaged and plaster is peeling. It’s noisy (I was on the 29th floor) and I wish I could have seen it “way back then”....because the heavy doors, marble trim on the walls, Art Deco artifacts by the elevators all look charming. But I’d never spend the $ i did here again. It needs a major overhaul. Convenient to the train stations though!;2
My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel in September. The hotel location is very good (if you want to stay in mid-town), close to Madison Square Garden, Penn Station and the theater district.   We found the hotel staff to be professional, but not the friendliest. We had issues checking in as there was error in the computer system related to the confirmation. Also, at the time of checking in we were told that the room wasn't ready and we would get a call when it's ready. Unfortunately, we never got a call. What I found annoying is that the hotel has a $5/bag hold fee, even for overnight guests. This is the first time I've encountered this in NYC, and there was only 1 person, at that time working the bag-check, so we had to wait 10-15 minutes, because the line was long.   The;3
Standard double room was very small with very old en-suite. Customer service is shocking in this hotel, rude, abrupt and arrogant. Definitely not worth its stars and it’s not cheap. Having said all that the location is perfect, but that’s all this hotel has going for it and lives off that as the hotel is very antiquated and shabby in parts. Would not stay here again.;3
"In town to see ""Hamilton"" for the second time and this was the prefect location. Easy walk to the theater district and many attractions. Beautiful lobby with very helpful staff. Spacious comfortable room. Close to Penn Station. Only minor negative the water temp in the shower bounced around a bit but it's an old hotel and you have to expect some minor quirks. Bonus, they were shooting ""Blue Bloods"" in the hotel one of the days we were there.";5
I had mixed feelings about our booking after reading some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. We had a Metro Room with a city view on the 32nd floor. The room was smaller than we are accustomed to, but there were 4 of us and we had quite a bit of luggage!  As others  have said, it is an older hotel and she is showing her age, but I could see where Wyndham is slowly trying to make improvements. Had issues with the shower running hot and cold intermittently,but no issues with water pressure. The Tick Tock Diner that is attached to the hotel has really good food. Had two meals there and ordered room service, all very good. Location, though, is excellent!! Madison Square Garden on the next corner, Penn Station/post office across the street from that, one subway entrance;4
"Really nice hotel.  Went there in July to stay for a weekend, will be back.  Beautiful views of the city.  Get a room which sees the Empire State Building.  It is worth it if you have to pay a little extra.  We were there when the power outage took place, so we saw the place at a ""tough"" time.  The staff was professional and everything was handled.  Our room lost power for a few hours but the main corridors stayed lit.  Also, as a side note, if you plan to take a bus or train in, it is only about 6/10 of a mile from the main bus station, and there is a subway stop right outside the hotel (it is very close to Madison Square Garden).  Great hotel to stay at for MSG or Broadway events, will be back.  Only reason I did not give it five is that the price for the rooms varies based on";4
It was a small room, but the location was perfect for what we needed. Right near Madison Square Garden, subway right there. Restaurants on site.  The building is gorgeous. I was happy with the stay and would come back. The chandelier in the lobby is to die for!!!;5
I was pleasantly surprised that what I thought would be a very touristy hotel, wasn't. This is an older building, but don't let that keep you from enjoying this centrally located, full-service hotel. The age and character that come with this classic art deco style hotel are part of the charm. You can feel the history of the place. Superb, friendly attentive service will always win in my book!;5
Worst hotel ever! Front dest staff were rude and unhelpful. The hotel NEVER answers the phone. I had corporate customer service try 5 times and they couldn't get through and said they never can!  I checked out after one night. Rooms are gross. Shower leaked and beds were itchy.;1
We booked this hotel because it was close to Penn Station and the theater we were going to.  For a Manhattan hotel, we thought the value was very good.  Our room was very spacious by NYC standards and the amenities were very nice.  The one thing we missed were shelves in the bath room.  It was an accessable room so perhaps they didn't think shelves were necessary.  The staff were friendly, courteous and efficient.  They accommodated our every need.  We've stayed at more expensive properties in Manhattan and they were not as nice or roomy as the New Yorker.  A high probability we'll be back when we come to NYC.;4
Hotel is nice in that it has two room suites and we had two bathrooms.  Suite hotels in NYC are impossible to find so it met our needs.   It needs remodeling.  The halls are dark and unpleasant.  Rooms ok, but need updating.;3
We have stayed at The New Yorker on 5 occasions now.  It is a superbly renovated art deco hotel with an wonderful nostalgic feel, and blended with this charm is an unbeatable friendliness and professionalism. Add to this the amazing location and you're on a winner - we'll continue staying at The New Yorker every time we're in NYC.;5
My sister and I have been staying at The New Yorker for about 10 years on our annual 3-day trip to the City.  We love the location, as we take the train in to Penn Station which is a short walk.  We pay a little extra for a metro view room because the rooms are larger.  Sometimes we even have two closets in addition to the two beds.  The checkin time is 4:00, so you normally need to check your luggage @$2 until you can get into your room.  We were fortunate on this trip that there was a room ready for us when we arrived at 1:00.  It was a Wednesday, so maybe there are more rooms ready for occupancy mid-week than on a weekend.  We just wish the bathroom had a shelf someplace for our toiletries.  There are no coffeepots in the rooms, but the Tick Tock Diner in the lobby offers a;4
Hotel is so busy with people and in a wonderful location. However, a friendly staff, Mohamed, made the check in nice and gave it a personal feel. I am so thankful.  The Room has an awesome view from the 29th floor.;5
I found this one of the most horrible hotels I've stayed in. The lobby looks amazing but once you enter the room corridors it looks dated and shabby. The room wasn't much better. We were in a standard room and stayed here in total for four nights in a standard room, two before a cruise and two after and both rooms were as bad as each other. Barely any natural lights gets in so the rooms are dark and gloomy. Also really ill thought out in terms of placing of electrical sockets, i.e. none near the mirror for plugging in hairdryers etc. The shower in one of the rooms had a constant dripping. The rooms are so pokey and there's no obvious place to store cases. In one room the desk and chair was even right next to the bed, meaning I then had to find a place to move the chair to so I;1
Stayed here for the second time and it was perfect again! Everybody is very kind and also the staff at the reception does everything to help you if you havr a problem! Perfect executive room with a view on the Empire! Would go back anytime!!;5
Fabulous hotel with friendly helpful staff. Perfectly located for sightseeing/shopping and around the corner from Penn Station.  Would definitely recommend. Rooms are perfectly nice, bathrooms a little tired but everywhere is clean.;5
We visited the New Yorker back in Feb 2019 as a surprise for my 40th birthday.  The staff were attentive as soon as we walked through the door. We were advised of all room fees on check in, although we were already aware as we do our homework before travelling. the room, although small, was comfortable, clean & had everything we would need for our stay. We overlooked MSG, which for a sports nut like me was perfect.  Chose to dine at the Tick Tock Diner for breakfast a few mornings and it was superb...go for the blueberry pancakes. Loved where the hotel was situated, right next to Penn Stn, but also within a decent walk to Times Sq, Central Park, ESB, Rockefeller etc...  Can't wait to return to NYC & this hotel will definitely be where we stay.;5
"Absolute rip-off. Advertise a rate, then squeeze another $34 PER NIGHT as a ""facility fee"". And if you want to leave your suitcases with them while you chill out on your last day, another $5 per case. The first hotel that has ever charged me for this. Do not stay here until they remove these ridiculous extra charges.";1
Very well located and I quite liked the old skool Art Deco feel off this hotel. And whilst I hear what people say about it being a tad tired (it is) for me that wasn’t a distractor. Large room with super comfy beds. Teeny tiny bathroom, which I think would be a tad painful If a large person or you were trying to navigate kids in and out of the shower, etc. but it was very clean, with lots of towels.  Very long queues for lifts but hey ho not a biggie BUT they charge $5 (Per Piece) to store luggage, which is an outrage. Not once in all my years of travel (work and social) across the spectrum of hotels I’ve stayed in have I had to pay to store luggage before/after checkout. On principle, I would never stay at this hotel again. Nor would the three others in my group.;3
"We chose the New Yorker for its location, a two minute walk from Penn Station, from where we were catching an AmTrak train after our stay in New York. And I’m glad we did, I really enjoyed four nights at a hotel with lots of character and history. We upgraded to an executive suite and had a great room - it was almost like an apartment! The room, and daily maid service, was excellent, and I’d happily stop here again. Down sides: 1) a mature lady on check-in was quite curt and unhelpful; though other check in staff were very pleasant and helpful. Indeed, other than her, all staff were polite and helpful. But her attitude put a dampener on our arrival. 2) our room wasn’t ready when we arrived, and they charged us $5 PER ITEM to store it for us while we killed time, so $20 in all. I";4
The New Yorking is a very historic hotel located right in the middle of all the action in Manhatton. Easy walking distance to the Empire State building and Time square. Tons of shopping all around including the massive Macy's store. Lots of food choices nearby as well. The rooms are very small and dated but comfortable.;3
Staff on reception didn't make a first impression ....busy or not first port of call..... Door security fab crew...really helpful .. Rooms nice ..views brilliant  Easy access To the dinner and hotel eatery ...and beat of all possition of hotel was spot on x;4
We stayed here for 5 nights in August. Hotel is in a great location with everything you need nearby. The area is very busy but then it is Manhattan. Room was clean and tidy as was the hotel. Found all the staff friendly and helpful with suggestions of directions etc as it was our first time in NY. We were offered a room upgrade at check in as apparently our booked room had a window but it only looked out onto a wall so for 15 dollars a night up grade we were on a higher floor and looked straight out to the Empire State Building so well worth the small charge.;5
Good location...steps away from Penn station. Be aware that they charge $37.00 US/night for resort fees. The fees are not justified. They basically include WIFI and telephone calls. We still had to pay the hotel to store our luggage after check out.;3
I had read reviews on the hotel before we travelled and was a bit nervous about staying here. I had nothing to worry about. The hotel is in a perfect location, right across from Madison Square Garden and next to Penn Station so you can get anywhere you need to. The hotel is slightly dated in the hallways but that is part of its charm. The room we stayed in 3255 wasnt too small at all. Had a small bathroom with bath and shower. The room also had a hairdryer which was a lifesaver as the power wasnt strong enough for mine. There was also an iron and an ironing board. There is no coffee or tea in the room but there is a diner downstairs and a starbucks across the road. The tick tock diner was also really good. Service was quick and food was really good. The staff in the hotel where;5
I’ve been to NYC twice and both times have stayed here! The New Yorker is a classy, yet down to earth hotel just a couple blocks from the Empire State Building and next to Madison Square Garden. There are a ton of metro stops surrounding the hotel. It is older and has a neat history (you can look up random famous people who have stayed there over the years). It has that old time New York feel. The rooms are small, but that’s a part of its charm. The staff is also very friendly and accommodating.;5
Stayed here for my daughters graduation celebrations.  Room was clean and beds comfortable, the room was quite narrow but long but had everything we needed, except a view we were looking at a brick wall!  We travelled September 2018 dropdown wont allow this far back;4
We stayed here for 5 days in August and were very impressed.   The hotel gave us a free upgrade as it was my birthday which meant a larger room with views towards MSG one side and the Hudson the other. It meant we had a sofa area including a fridge which is much more than we were expecting after reading other reviews saying you could only just about shuffle around the bed.  Air con was good which was much needed in the 90 degree heat they have in August.  The rest of the hotel I thought was nice. Not modern like other hotels may be but it added to the charm of this famous old building. Make sure you go down to level -1 from reception to see all of the hotel's history.  Location was good - near enough to Times Square but far enough to be out of all the craziness. Right next to;5
Absolutely loved this hotel and defo won’t stay anywhere else when in New York  Was checked in by Driss on reception who looked after our every need whilst we was there in fact all staff from the doorman to the cleaners were fantastic  Remember tho this is a old hotel with character so if your looking for up to date stuff this maybe isn’t for you in fact it reminded me of staying in the Empire State Building which was built around the same time  Our room was 3615 and the view was amazing we could lay in bed and see the Empire State Building all lit up at night plus we could see madison Square Garden  Room was fresh and clean we heard very little noise from other rooms guests etc  Lifts were very quick and no waiting like some people have said on here  Tick tock diner is great;5
Me and my friend stayed here for 7days at the end of August this year, the Art Deco style throughout the hotel is lovely, yes I would say some features my need updating but fab looking hotel, very clean and the staff are so welcoming and helpful. The hotel has a Facebook messenger so you are able to ask questions etc they are very helpful even gave information relating to the city which really helped us out.  There is a facility fee which is applied to all guests the hotel price on its website is $34.08 plus taxes per night- depending on who you book with the facility fee may be cheaper. Most hotels in New York City have a fee like this as the name suggests it’s for the facilities that are in the hotel you have use of the gym, they are computers with printers etc. They have a;5
Definitely not a 4* hotel as advertised. Old, dated, aging hotel. Rooms are tiny, with a musty, damp odor - charges for everything including storing baggage (never heard of such a thing before), refrigerator, coffee maker etc.  Best avoided in favor of any number of hotels in the area.;2
Beautiful hotel in a great location- right next to MSG and Penn Street Subway. An easy 10 min walk to Times Sq and all the major stores. There’s a chemist across the street that sells snacks, wine & beer which is handy! The Tick Tock diner on site does great breakfasts and The 2 other restaurants offer lovely evening dining! We had a suite on the 31st floor with a huge balcony and had great views. Would definitely stay here again!;5
I love the New Yorker and have been staying there for 15 years, before Wyndham's management of the property. We take the train from Washington to Penn Sta, often arriving in the city before we can check in, or staying in the city after we check out. I have stayed in many other hotels in the city also, but often choose The New Yorker for convenience and it's familiarity. Over the last several years the sales pitches and nickel/dime fees have gotten more and more out of control. For example bag storage fees (free in a great majority of New York hotels) used to be free at The New Yorker... then it was $1/bag after Wyndham took over management.  Now it's $5 per bag, which is out of control. Paying another $30 just to stow 3 bags upon arrival and departure, while being pitched to;3
Staff friendly and attentive to guests needs. I arrived 3 hours earlier than expected but they found a room for me right away. Like the next door access to the subway and walking distance many other sights. Lots of international travelers stay here.;5
You only receive the basic room, everything else you have to pay for. Extras like  anything at home you take for granted. We upgraded to a family room for the two of us and this was okay but it came as an expensive surcharge .It was worth it because we had a balcony looking down onto the streets. This enabled us to have a dink in the night air. I would recommend upgrading if you can. The hotel itself is referred to as 'Art Deco' I would refer to it as lacking in a refurbishment programme. There does not seem to be one individual in charge. They would benefit in my opinion of having a general manager. The hotel is clean and most of the staff are helpful. In saying all of this the best attribute of the hotel is the location. Just a couple of blocks away from Times Square which you;4
Clean, safe, functional.  No microwave, coffee pot, mini-fridge in room.  I think you can get them for extra fees.  Convenient to subway and Penn Station.  Excellent bagel/muffin shop across the street.  Hotel employees were cordial.;3
Whenever my wife and I have the opportunity to visit NYC for a little sightseeing we always stay at the New Yorker. The timeless Art Deco architecture and the newly updated rooms that retain that style and charm really appeal to us and contribute to a relaxed feeling in the midst of the city. The hotel is very conveniently located--right on the ACE subway line, close to the HIghline, Hudson Yards, Chelsea, Times Square. Just a great location. The staff are very helpful as well.;5
Great service from the minute we walked in the lobby. Friendly staff and very helpful in directing you to destination. Room was clean and bright with an excellent view from the 37th floor. Love the art deco look of the hotel. Convenient to Madison Square Garden and Peen station, Macy's and restaurants. Will stay there again. Recommend.;4
Mohammed was quick and efficient and very friendly checking us in. We keep coming back to The New Yorker for its location, great food in the Tic Tock and and the old charm. The room was very comfortable, clean and spacious.;4
Stayed for 7 nights for our first trip to NYC  and had a room on the 35th floor with a view out to the Hudson, which was great.The room was small but perfect for us with a lovely original bath and plenty of character, with great air con and really comfy bed and pillows. The hotel's location is perfect, right in the middle of Manhattan and right next to Penn station and subway.It  would be perfect if they would drop the facilities fee. Also I would not recommend the Tick Tock diner, over priced and over rated food!;4
Hotel is in a great central location. You can readily walk to Penn Station and many many restaurants are local to this Hotel, a McDonalds and an Italian restaurant are opposite the hotel. Empire state building, Time Square are walking distant if you are an able bodied person. The staff are all great and polite especially Alfonsa who helped greatly. The room was really lovely and large. The bathroom was equally large and functional. The room faced 8th Avenue and so was noisy especially for the city that does not sleep. The windows could have done with a clean otherwise the views were great.There are 20 floors some rooms are newer and most likely better than other small rooms that you are only comfortable for sleeping in. Room 850 was a great sized room compared to the first room;4
Great location for easy walking access to MSG, Empire State Building, Broadway, and Central Park.  However the hotel itself has little to offer as it is outdated and badly in need of refurbishment, and the interest levels of some of the staff is particularly low.;3
The hotel has very small rooms. Very noisy as rooms face 8th Avenue and are directly across the street from Penn Station. Very clean with friendly staff. Unfortunately, they charge $5.00 for each bag to store prior to check in and check out.  The lobby is great and the hotel’s architecture is Art Deco as it opened in 1930. Good place to visit.... would not stay here again, did not feel safe at night and security did not ask to see each guests room key prior to getting in the elevator!;2
I would definitely go back here again! It is not like the chain hotels but instead gives a real feel of what a New York hotel is like. Rooms are small but that's the reality of life in New York. I lived there most my life and can say it's a good stay- there is a 24 hour cafe downstairs with great New York flavor diner type food and an Asian restaurant around the corner - excellent. Macys 34th street, Broadway, Madison Sq gardens, LI railroad, subway, and Times Square etc. a quick and beautiful close walk. Location is excellent.;4
The New Yorker met all expectations.  It is 1 block from Penn Station, one block from Madison Square Garden.  We arrived at NOON, we were able to immediately check in and have access to our room at No extra charge.  The room was newly renovated, clean, fresh and perfect for two people.  The desk person was terrific, helpful, and downright friendly.  The hotel has a 24 hour cafe as well as a nice steakhouse on site.  The location lends itself to innumerable places to eat and shop nearby offsite.  We walked easily to Times Square, .6 mile away.  The poor reviews posted here are “fake news” based on our experience.  We will stay at the New Yorker in the future as well as tell friends and family about our positive experience here.   Do not hesitate to use this hotel on your visit to;5
A very busy place. I am not sure we got value for money as there was no support to get to know New York. Enjoy the sites and activities. It was hot with plenty of beggars around. As a first time visitor there was plenty to get to know and do.;4
Stayed for four nights, excellent location, upgraded room with view of Empire State was lovely! Clean and tidy, good facilities enjoyed stay. Staff very helpful and doorman was excellent getting taxis, would stay again.;4
Great customer service and very warm greeting.. Even after my stay I got a financial issue and it was fixed by lady called Neida .. she is the best .. honestly all the stuff there were so cooperative.;5
Our room was terrible. I never complain about the room, but this was the first time that I couldn't stand the dirtiness. The hair was all around the bathroom. The towels were dirty and disgusting, looked like they were not washed. I didn't have space in the room to open my suitcase how small the room was (just space for a bed). I complained to the manager about this. They apologized and immediately gave us another room. The new room was much better, but still not very clean. This hotel should not be more than 3 stars. Elevators were very slow and congested. The hotel provided free printing, which was very good. However, we needed to pay $5 per baggage when we wanted to leave the baggage in the hotel in order to wait for our flight. This was the only hotel I stayed at that asked;3
Hotel was great, lots of activity, friendly, clean, great location. Restaurants attached had really good food, service.  Bed was comfortable. I stayed at this hotel years ago and it was greatly improved and I would stay here again. Price was very reasonable.;5
We booked a family suite for August. Having received an email for an upgrade, I emailed the hotel directly and had it confirmed for a family terrace suite. on arrival we were told there was no terrace suites available despite showing the confirmation. We were given a refund of the resort fees ( $150) which I'm still waiting for btw...  We stayed in the family suite in room 731. Decent room and clean but the two 'QUEEN ' beds are more like small double beds.The pull out sofa was bigger and pretty comfy to be fair so no issues with that. Coffee maker, fridge in the room and the coffee pods and 2 bottles of water were topped up daily & were free. Proper steam iron in the room which was good, Hair dryer also provided. The bathroom was VERY small even though the shower was a good;3
Hotel is ok.  Plan for long elevator waits, especially at busier/high traffic times.  We stayed above 20th floor and the wit was long. Room is dated and hallways are not appealing when you first step off.  The washrooms do not have space for toiletries. I guess it's due to the age of the hotel. However, location is close to a lot and close to subway stations, but is very busy.  It's good for staying if you have a short stay like we did to save on travel times.;3
We had 6 people in our party so booked a suite at The New Yorker. The suite looked nothing like the photos on the website. I know that NY hotel rooms are much smaller than other cities but I did expect the suite to be a little larger. The small pull out sofa in the living room was stained, there was no coffee maker in room (later found out they charge for it, which is a first for me) bathroom was very dated, small and no counter to place items on. The AC did not work well at all so we were very warm, and there was no hot water the day we checked in. We had 6 people take cold showers. I called housekeeping at one point for extra towels and they never showed up. Overall, so not a good experience. I've stayed at the Lotte New York Plaza and the W Hotel in Times Square. Huge;2
I have been staying at The New Yorker since 1996.  I have stayed in excess of 30 times, and frequently as long as 3 weeks in duration.  I have been honored to have worked with Carola Peppe, Patricia Ryan and, best of all, Madeline Marte -- all excellent  reservation specialists who ALWAYS managed to secure Suite 4005 for me.  This suite is, in my opinion, the best in the building.  On the 40th floor south-east corner, it looks directly at the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building from the east, and all the way down to the Statue of Liberty from the south: definitely the most spectacular New York City view I have seen, including from some of the famous landmarks.  Unfortunately, the hotel has gone steadily downhill since it was purchased by Wyndham.  Since I always got;1
We stayed here for 4 nights and found the location to be perfect. Handy to have the diner downstairs so if you arrive late at night you can easily grab food. The lobby is stunning so going from this to your room is a little disappointing as you’re expecting something grand but the rooms are a little dated and basic however they are clean, the beds comfy and the shower is powerful so all you need when you’re not spending much time there. If we went back to New York, I’d definitely rebook here with it being just a 10 minute walk from Times Square;4
We love to stop over in this vintage hotel situated in the heart of Manhattan. Even though the breakfast is not included in the room price, there is an adjusting bar open 24h/7 days a week and a chic restaurant situated in the basement: a former bank safe :-) One can put all the chargers on the hotel key - no inconvenience  of separate payments. Pay attention to a “cubist” mural in the stairway, downstairs, in association with a mirror breaking down your image in a similar way.;5
Our stay at the New Yorker was great. The hotel is very conveniently located near Penn Station which was great for us as we came in on the train. It is well situated in midtown near easy access to everything you want to see in New York City. My only complaint is that it was pretty crummy and dirty just outside the hotel on the sidewalk, but that's a New York problem not a New Yorker problem.;5
We stayed here following a concert at Madison Square Garden  end it was excellent! Easy to get to Karma very close, and our room had a fabulous view of balz Madison Square Garden and Empire State building! I would highly recommend and will be back!;5
I read the reviews,  some great, some bad and some in the middle.  I was very nervous.  In my opinion. I loved the hotel.  It is beautiful despite it being a little old. In a great location.  I can see the Empire State Building from my window which we loved. We nervous about the size of the room. It is on the smaller size but not horrible.  Actually a little bit bigger than I expected.  Plus, if you are on vacation,  you don't want to sit in your room.  You want to just sleep there. Enjoy the city! Beds were very comfortable,  air conditioning was very cold. I was very lucky. The lobby was beautiful  and large. Check in and out was easy. No lines and did everything easily.  Staff was nice. Even has security before you go to the elevator. Elevators were short wait. My only;4
Will not spend my points to stay there again. Extremely dirty. Hair everywhere. Tiny bedroom. Not to mention only 1 person at front desk, and the longest line to check in. Very disappointed. Never again.;1
Wonderfully located west side hotel that was very convenient to shopping, convention center, hi line, church and transit of all types....room was perfectly located, staff able to allow me access sooner than typical check in time....long wait lines at times for check in/ checkout, that said, hotel was able to house my luggage independent of checking in/out...a plus from many perspectives....;5
We stayed here for our first week in NYC at the iconic NY hotel, from the photos I see there are very nice rooms but ours was old dated and dingy. It was very small, the bathroom was right out of the 1960s and it was old and daggy.;2
Our room wasn’t big but it is New York.  Great location & the availability of food so close is a bonus. Close to Penn Station so easy access . Madison Square Gardens is across the road & all the tour buses are close. Easy walk to Tim Square;4
"The location is excellent, right in the middle of everything. The building has character and history. But the way the place is run is not customer-focused. They add a facility fee to the nightly rate without telling you. Instead of a concierge to help you with your trip they have a sales desk to sell you ""vacations"". The front desk has a long line at check in and check out. The lobby is unkept and crowded with people waiting for their room. And theres a laundry room in the basement but it isn't for hotel guests, it's for a hostel?! It doesn't have the same level of service or commitment to customer satisfaction as most Wyndham properties in this price range. If you are looking for good service, you'll be disappointed. If you can handle minimal service, and you want to be walking";3
Very nice clean room.  Two windows, nice view. Such a great surprise perk, toiletries from bumble and bumble.  Perfect location to get everywhere, everyone at this hotel is very nice. 12pm checkout, so awesome. Would definitely stay here again.;5
We went here thinking since it was close to Broadway, we could enjoy the show we had tickets for without walking.   We don't mind walking, but wow, super far.   Also, rooms were extremely small and sheets were stained and rough.   One flat pillow each ,seriously?  One towel each mind you, I have long hair and need one for my hair as well but they didn't answer the phone upon Calling the front.    Extremely long lines and poor service.;1
The hotel is very convenient to Penn Station and to subways.  The hotel is decorated in Art Deco style.  The employees are courteous and helpful  The lobby provides a comfortable place to relax while one is waiting for the next event on the agenda.  The beds are very comfortable.;5
The hotel met all our needs! It was very accommodating! Allowed us early acces to our room and the gym was outstanding. The restaurant was very good and the location was great to get anywhere we wanted to go.;5
We were recommended this property from our travel agent and a brief google search gave us some optimism. It was a 4-star hotel, in a great location, so what could go wrong?  We were prepared for the $35 city tax, per room, per night, so that wasn't a shock to us. The rooms are very small, and outdated. Coming from London, we are used to some small hotel rooms, but this was beyond belief, once you had your suitcase and other belongings in the room, you had no moving space. The hallways are a dirty brown colour, and they look like they have not been updated for 20/30 years.   The location is great, you are right next to Madison Square Garden's, Penn Station and a host of other places. It is pretty easy for you to get around new york with Cabs, Uber's and the Subway.   We were;3
We chose the hotel due to the amazing location and indeed the hotel is in central Manhattan, close to all the main attractions. However, we were quite disappointed by the facilities and the room as well as the service. It seems that the hotel is acting as a low cost hotel, to store your luggage on your last day you have to pay 5dollars per item. The bathroom wasn’t very clean and not modern at all, very disappointing. The beds were good and the size of the room okay. This hotel doesn’t even feel like one but more like a room that you rent with no additional benefits or service.;3
Great hotel in a charming part of the city.  Loved the accessibility to the High Line Park & walking trail and the Chelsea Market.  Spacious room that was super clean with comfortable beds.  Lots of shopping and art galleries in the area.;4
Good points - great location for major tourist attractions. Close to the subway. Tick tock diner in the lobby had excellent food (although pricey). Very friendly hotel security guards. Great views if on the right site of the hotel. Bed linen and towels clean and fresh. Convenient coffee cart downstairs for a quick snack. We complained that our room was tiny (couldn’t lay 2 suitcases down) and got moved to a bigger one.  Bad points - no coffee / tea making facilities in the room. No fridge. Needs updating a lot - especially for the price. Paint in bathroom flaking off. Carpet needs changing. Whole place needs a refurb. Very noisy - surrounding rooms using their water created a racket in ours. We were close to the lifts which woke us up a lot. Some staff were abrupt (to the point;3
I love this hotel and have stayed a few times. I love the Art Deco style. The location is perfect! The subway directly outside is one of the main lines and also takes you directly to JFK for around $8 which is an absolute bargain!  You’re a block down from Herald Square & Macy’s, just another block on is the Empire State Building. About ten min walk down to Times Square. There’s a little deli in the reception area selling coffees and bagels etc. There’s also a diner attached to the hotel which can be accessed from inside or outside the hotel. We had breakfast here one morning and it was a fab American style breakfast. The rooms are small - but then so are most in NYC! But they’re clean comfortable and everything you need. We came for my 30th and they sent a free bottle of;5
We had visited New York many times and I always wanted to stay in this Iconic Hotel. So when I got tickets to go to a concert in Madison Square Garden I booked it. Was very good for access to the subway and within walking distance of many of the attractions. Loved the older style feel to the hotel.  Only thing that let it down was after we checked out and went to leave left luggage. I was shocked when they charged us $5 per bag left. First time l have ever been charged to leave my luggage in a hotel I have just checked out of.;3
With a diner right downstairs, a fun location at the heart of the busiest area in mid town, steps away from Macy's and Times Square, you can't go more New York than and The New Yorker.  Its old school glam, lovely, welcoming staff and of course the vibrant location all call out - you're in New York, Enjoy!! So I was in town for a conference right across the street, but I loved this hotel. I got a really nice sized high up room (like 20+ floor), which was spacious and nice. I also found myself enjoying the diner a lot, since it's open 24/7 offering all american comfort food. I loved how comfortable the business center was, always available for a quick print out or a retouching of a document. The fact that the diner had a coffee stand right in the middle of the lobby, made it;5
Having flown in from Nassau disappointed about the Atlantis hotel there, we were looking forward to coming to New York to a 'reknowned' hotel that we expected would put our faith back into vfm stays. A good sign then that Virgin Atlantic cabin crew use this hotel for their layovers. The fact that a large number of guests checking in on a Sunday evening with us also shows a hotel in demand. Check in was done reasonably efficiently although waiting for a lift to the room on the 21st floor wasn't. It would appear that all the new guests were booked into floor 20 and above this causing a scrum for elevators...(the other bank for floor 20 and below were very frequent with very little demand). Upon gaining entry to the cubby hole room 2144 we were greeted by the mess let by the;3
Poor customer service and poor quality of rooms. The trip started off with a room that had a smelly odor, dirty tub and towels, and dirty linen. I went down to tell the front desk (after waiting 10 minutes for an elevator). They moved me to a new room that at least didn't smell bad (still dirty though). For price of this hotel, it is absolutely unacceptable to be exposed to this low level of quality in the rooms. The customer service is also horrible. When I wanted to checkout there was a long line so I called to see if there was anything else I needed to do to check out. The lady on the phone was very rude and yelled at me when I said that I had already left the room without letting them know (which doesn't make any sense to me - since I was calling to LET THEM KNOW). After a;1
Just returned from a week at the New Yorker. When we arrived they wanted a 50 dollar payment for an early check in we arrived at 14.00 and the check in time was 16.00 however they let us check in free of charge as it was our anniversary. We paid for an upgrade for a room with a fridge and a view. The room was so small there was no where to store our cases and when the fridge was delivered they had to take out the desk chair to fit the fridge in also there was no hairdryer. The following morning at 6.00 the toilet flooded our bathroom and we had to wait an hour for someone to come and fix it. Jessica on the front desk was amazing and arranged for us to change room and the room was everything we wanted. We can’t fault the service we received so we packed up went out for the day;4
The hotel is a great art deco hotel.  It has not been kept up.   There were bugs on the landing when getting off the elevator.  Customer service was substandard.  The room was clean but the bathroom was really small.  Homeless in front of the hotel.  It was an easy walk to time square and penn station.  I really feel it wasn't worth the cost;3
Good Service but Outdated property needs major work.  Room Key Failures, Elevators packed with people stopping on every floor (20+ minutes to get out every morning) and rust in the bathroom.  Not a good experience;1
I can't even review this hotel because they cancelled my reservation the day of arrival. Altough the reservation made through booking mentions the payment is at the hotel, they tried to get the first night out of my credit card before my arrival. Because it didn't work they've sent me an email to change credit card information which I didn't read because I was flying to NY. So the reservation made 5 months before was cancelled just like that. Upon check-in they informed me that they couldn't give any room because the hotel was overbooked. So this hotel allowed for my family with small children and an elderly person stayed in the street in a New York friday evening. I've never seen such thing before in my life. Fortunately I found online a better hotel for the same price just one;1
Came back to this awesome hotel after 2 years and had a great time.  The rooms were in excellent condition for being  originally built back in the 30's they did a great job in keeping the integrity of history here.  Rooms are small just like most hotels in Manhattan but it was clean and very nice.;5
The hotel was dirty--esp the bathroom. There was only room for a bed and desk. No mini-fridge as promised. (I spent very little time in the hotel, but still.) The check-in lady was extremely rude (but the check out man was very nice). The elevators are slow and even though they are divided, it takes forever to get one. If you are an upper floor like I was, you can take 30 flights of stairs down but going back up is a pain.   Tick-tock diner was a little overpriced, but the highlight of the hotel anyway. Open 24/7 with a really nice and friendly staff. Try the carrot cake!   In all, I've stayed at similarly priced hotels in better locations in Manhattan with better clearner rooms;2
The room was even better than expected - a great view from upper floors to Empire State Building. The room condition and facilities as advertised - clean, silent but nothing special extra. However, it was ok, since we spent our time outside visiting the city, and not staying at room more than to regain freshness. So, we were well satisfied with the provided room and services, also to mention - the location of the hotel is excellent.;5
Poor check in, additional charges for every little item including leaving bags with the bell boy. No tea and coffee facility in the room despite confirming in the original booking. Rooms were very small and with very old furniture.;1
This is a historical hotel at Penn Station. Renovated some years ago it is a bit worn but still very nice. Great staff. We got a suite with cash+points for $200 per night with a great view. Breakfast is not included.;4
This hotel is in a prime location for subway, walking and some low cost alternatives like Starbucks, McDonald's and Famiglia pizza.  The restaurants at the hotel are not necessarily costly given its NYC but more costly than the average person would spend.  The staff are all courteous and there were people at a desk to help with information such as how to get someplace, the closest place for dessert, etc.  Rooms were clean but small.  There is no coffee pot, microwave or refrigerator but a $30 resort fee.  The fee and taxes totaled $60 additional per night.  This is common in NYC, not just this hotel, so buyer beware. For a fee, I was able to check in early.  Check out is at noon which is a bonus.  We walked or took the subway everywhere.  Penn station is right next door, Long;3
"My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful 6 night stay at the New-Yorker from 4-9 October 2018. Centrally located with excellent facilities and staff who were both attentive and very responsive WHILST WE WERE THERE. Whilst there, we were encouraged by the Reception staff to join the Club Wyndham which we did.  However, in the ten months that have elapsed since then, our follow-up emails have gone unanswered and website contact ignored, leaving us without ANY confirmation of our membership or ANY correspondence or acknowledgement relating thereto. Totally out of character with the level of service we received whilst at this Hotel; and a real 'let-down' from an otherwise highly professional, highly regarded facility.";5
The hotel was very nice and on arrival we were upgraded as we had booked three rooms and they wanted to make sure we were all together which was great. We handed over a credit card to pay for any extras we might incur during our stay, again this was fine. Upon waking on our last morning we found a bill for $130 per room labelled ‘facilities fee’. This was for WiFi, gym and business services. The only one we used was WiFi but this came up as free when we logged on. Apparently we should have been made aware of this fee when we booked as everyone pays it. We weren’t and it isn’t mentioned on our reservation paperwork. On checking the credit card bill when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us on checking in without telling us at the time. £321 for WiFi. Not good.;2
The hotel charged a facilities fee ($30 a night) on checkout. This was not mentioned in any prior communication by them, which includes a lot of emails advertising the final rate.  I can understand additional charges for which the amount varies based on the services you use during your visit. But given that this is a fixed charge that will be levied in any scenario, why not include this is the final amount at the time of booking? I don't see any difference between this and resort fees, and a lot of hotels charge the latter upfront. And I made the booking using the Wyndham site itself, no third party. I find this intentionally deceptive on the resort's part.  The cleanliness, size of the rooms, and the service at the place was quite mediocre. The only reason I chose this place;1
Came into town for a concert at MSG. Wanted a hotel within walking distance of the arena...found The New Yorker and what a lovely choice !! Spacious lobby with an art deco motif. Front desk staff were very polite , professional and accommodating. We were given an upgrade and the room was very lovely......modern, updated and the bathroom, tho small ,was tastefully done.....glass wall step in shower, vessel sink, etc. Nice restaurant attached to the lobby serving meals 24/7....great breakfast !! I would highly recommend The New Yorker to anyone visiting NYC wanting a centrally located hotel !;4
The facility fee really annoyed me.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't use much wifi in the room on holiday because I'm rarely in the room.  I also wouldn't waste my time in New York in the gym or on the computers etc. So for us it was just $248 extra for nothing.  Apparently it's very clear and all the hotels do it, but I didn't see it in the small print so be aware.  The room was very small and basic so we really wanted to be out of it most of the time too (which was ok because the aim of the holiday was sight seeing). The main plus is the location, which is excellent (right in the middle of everything) and I've got to say it was clean and housekeeping was good.;3
Great location close to Penn / MSG - Literally 1.5 blocks away. Worked out great to see Queen concert...  Rooms are what they are for NYC (size-wise) We got upgraded so no complaints:-) Queen Suite w/ private outdoor patio;4
I love this old building. Tiny room is OK for tourists who have a lot to do in the busy city. Fitness facilities are good as well, and 24 hours available. However some staff were not friendly, especially lobby staff. Room staff were good: broken safe box was fixed within an hour.;3
The foyer is amazing and we didn't have to queue to check in.  We were given room 2201 which has two double beds and two bathrooms.  Initially the room looked amazing but we were right next to the elevator room and it was continuously so noisy, it sounded like a supermarket trolley on a hardwood floor all day and all Night!! We rang reception and asked to move rooms but were told none were available and were given ear defenders to mask the noise and help us sleep. One of the bathrooms the shower was cold and the other the toilet leaked soiled water onto the floor. Both baths were really marked and the grills in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned for years. We didn't sleep properly all the time we were on our holiday due to the noise.  The location was amazing but for what we paid;3
Just back from staying at the New Yorker. Hotel lobby is beautiful. Love the Art Deco elements of it. Room had no view at all but we were hardly in the room. Great shower and bathroom. Room a decent size and had Art Deco furniture and accessories. We had coffee making machine in the room and we were given fresh bottles of water everyday by housekeeping, we paid for a fridge and I would recommend you do that. $30 one off fee. Rooms have a safe. The room was very clean. I’d say 90% of staff were friendly and helpful. Great location for station, shopping and sites. Tick Tock diner and Italian bar and restaurant on site which are great for ease of use but very expensive. We did Tick Tock twice. Nice food and good service. We would stay there again.;4
The entrance is amazing and reception is clean, bright & an area of calm. First impressions were great & we were happy to be staying in an iconic New York landmark! Unfortunately, the room was disapointing - it was average size and the beds were comfortable. The cleanliness however is not up to standard in a hotel of this alledged calibre - the head of housekeeping needs to inspect the room more thoroughly.The bath needs an upgrade - the attached photo shows the base of the bath with ground in dirt that cant be removed. The back of the bathroom door also needs a thorough clean as did other areas where dust collects. The decor in the room is tired & another small inconvenience was that the TV is not wall mounted and this takes up surface space. Not having a fridge or tea/coffee;2
Stayed here for 2 nights to round up a family holiday in Orlando. The hotel entrance is beautiful  and reception well staffed. Check in was straight forward and quick and the staff were friendly.   We are a family of 4, with teenage boys. The room was reasonably sized with a bathroom at each end. We had booked a family room through Virgin so assumed that the beds would be suitable for our family. We had a room with two queen size beds. As a family with an average height of 6’ but all slim build, we found the beds too small and also very soft so we didn’t sleep particularly well. We had a view of a brick wall, I assume that could have been rectified if we’d requested an upgrade.   A safe is provided in the room free of charge.  There were plenty of plug sockets and a hairdryer;3
Most inexpensive rooms are dark interior courtyard rooms. You can pay $$$ for upgrades to rooms higher up with views and light but you should then consider staying in a nicer overall hotel away from Madison Square Garden area.;3
Place was amazing. Security at the door made me feel very safe. The location next to Penn Station was wonderful for us as we came in from NJ Airport by train. Three blocks away from the Empire State Building and very close to the Highline. There is a convenient Italian Pizzeria and McDonald's across the street with a convenience store about a block away. Also close to Macy's. No hotel is in the center of everything in NYC, but the location of this hotel made everything seem fairly close.  Our room was extremely spacious (bigger than mine at home), with TWO full baths and a view to Penn Station (we chose not to get an ESB view). Beds were very comfortable and loved the antique touches to the door handles. The room was very clean. Honestly, one of the best rooms we've gotten in a;5
Nice hotel next to a Subway station. Clean rooms with big amazing and relaxing beds. WiFi signal is strong. The restaurant of the hotel for breakfast or lunch/dinner was good with a great variety of choises. Staff was always kind and helpful. Unfortunately, our room was not very spacious and there was no storage fridge. Overall, it is an economical and descent hotel, close to most of the sightseeing activities of New York. I definitely propose It.;4
Had a confirmed booking but when I showed up the front desk said the hotel was sold out and in the negative for rooms.  Did not offer solutions or assistance or walk me to another hotel they are partnered with.  Called the company I booked with and in 20 minutes they had me booked at another property.  I would seriously consider not going to this hotel if they oversell online.  It was a busy night in the city so I am lucky I had another option.;1
A great hotel in the center of Manhattan. You can go to the most famous places from that. In addition it's good for people who want to study because there's a residence in the Hotel for students. I had a great time there.;5
I first stayed here in November 2017 with my sister . We arrived to the room about 6ish from Newark and I had a bad migraine . The view from the window was lovely (not the Empire State Building direction but still good) . Room was small but most are in New York . There was a tv with an ok range of channels on , a bath in the bathroom as welcome too . I really liked stayed here it’s close enough to Times Square , Penn station subway is right outside , it’s next to Maddison square garden too , and there is a 24hour diner at the bottom . There are fees to pay at the end for the facilities regardless of whether you use the facilities or not and if you don’t want to be caught out I would use the resort fee checker before booking any New York hotel .  In February 2019 I returned with;3
When we booked this hotel over a year ago we booked an Empire State Building view room. We knew this wasn’t guaranteed but after emailing the hotel prior to our arrival explaining that we were coming to celebrate my Mum’s special birthday, I felt sure our booking request would be honoured. Fast forward to check in yesterday and we were told the room we’d reserved wasn’t available. However they had “upgraded” is to a suite with two bathrooms at no extra cost and waived the city tax. They told us our room would be available at about 4.30pm (even though check in is from 4pm) and that they would text or call us when it was ready. We went to leave our bags (10 bags as there were 5 of us travelling) and found there is a $5 per bag charge!!!!! My husband combined that he wouldn’t pay;3
Location, Location, Location....The New Yorker is truly in the heart of NY City. Located in walking distance from Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, Broadway, and Times Square. Just a few miles from at least a dozen other world recognized tourist attractions.;4
Gorgeous Art Deco style and great location.   I booked a room with a city view, but when I arrived I was told there were none available. Not sure how this happened when the hotel had several weeks notice.;3
- Noisy room beside elevator machine - requested another room and had to wait next day - the original room had extra bathroom because I paid for that and the new one didn’t have and you charged  - I had to go to your front desk 4 times to solve everything (wasted 2 hours in total);1
Firstly, the hotel is not new at all. It could have been renovated and modernized slightly but the old feeling is still there namely on the elevator, interior of the room and bathroom. The room is not that big as it is expected for most of NYC hotels, however the location is excellent as it's located near Macy's, shopping avenues, restaurants and 24 hour convenient stores. Staff are mostly excellent, you are required to show your key room whenever you want to use the elevator. Upon checking in, I found the receptionist just wanted to get the job done, too quick, not too friendly and informative.;3
We had booked two rooms for a four night stay at the New Yorker Hotel. On arrival we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who offered us two rooms next to each other on the 21st floor. The rooms were quite small dated but they were clean. There are not any tea or coffee making facilities in the room and after a long day of sightseeing it would have been nice to come back and make a cuppa.New York has become quite expensive even the Tick To k Diner that adjoins the hotel was pricey. Overall the hotel was fine but it is no more than a three star  New;3
Requested suite with 2 double beds & sofa bed,did not get. Room wasn’t even ready at 430 when check In was 4pm. Smoke alarms went off in middle of night & we were in lobby til 430 in the morning. No explanation as to what happened. Never stay there again;2
Great room. Very big with two queen beds. Great location for visiting all of New York. Just a straight walk to time square. Staff were helpful and always there when you needed them. It was a stones throw from madison Square garden and the bus terminal.;4
The hotel was basic corridors were in need of updating but rooms although small was clean bathroom was clean bed was very comfortable and sheets were crisp and spotless  The hotel was ideal for exploring NYC;4
This hotel built in 1929 is very nice.  By today’s standards the rooms are small and bathrooms dated but we loved it.  All the staff was fantastic and friendly.  In a great location for bus, subway, or rail travel.  I would recommend this hotel to all.   Restaurants in the hotel are nice but there are many options nearby for about any type of food you want.  Stay at The New Yorker and you should not regret it.  Go enjoy the “Big Apple” and have fun.;4
As I’m writing this review I don’t even know where to start.  It started on the day of our arrival our reservation was canceled while on the plane. So we arrived early evening with a very big surprise. The reception told us it wasn’t a problem and checked us in.. and guess what the price just went up the fees went up and till our surprise we had to pay more and more.. about $1200 more than the original booking price. Surprised, super tired and annoyed we checked In and decided to take this up with the manager the next morning and paid 2/3 of our stay.. Next morning we noticed the blankets we slept under (too tired to check everything cause you don’t expect that) had (blood) stains to us that’s pretty unforgivable and disgusting for a 4 star rated hotel.. as everything wasn’t bad;1
Perfect base for out first visit to NY. Small room yes, why would I want to pay for a big one when we spent only our sleeping time in the hotel. Fabulous views from the 32nd floor. Central location perfect for heading out in all directions. Also a landmark itself means it makes it easy to find your way back should you get lost.;4
Average hotel . It seems to be common practice that certain rooms so not have tea and coffee making services in the room and no fridge . Internet Service is good but you need to lob in every 24 hours. Expensive for what you get .;3
This weekend I booked a room and accidently made two reservations. I contacted the hotel and the 3rd party multiple times too get help with this issue. To no avail Nobody would help me undo this disaster. A few days prior i was released from ICU from a stroke. IM 29, and this is all new too me medically.I booked the room in the first place bevciause I needed somewhere to stay close to my rehab center for the stroke. As soon as i realized that I had two hotels i immediately started chat/calls to try to elevate one but Wyndham refused as well as refused to even alter the dates. I take my health seriously and although im learning the side effects of a stroke. I would have thought that a company would take that into consideration as oppose to kicking me down agin and losing close;1
Tiny rooms.  Chaotic elevators.  Fantastic views.  Incredible location close to subway and hotspots.  Macdonalds,  starbucks and Cvs in front.  Very clean.  Cheap for the zone.  Crowded.  We were 4 in the room and is difficult to live with that space.;3
Really enjoyed our four night stay at the wyndham New Yorker , perfect location,friendly staff,rooms a little small but why come to New York to sit in your room anyway? perfect for us,spotlessly clean,The tick tock restaurant in the hotel served lovely food too. Would definitely stay here again;5
The bedroom en toto was too small with a very uncomfortable, very small bathroom and no coffee maker in the room. The room had been painted but they did a sloppy job of it. Couldn't get consistency of the heat/cooling system. They should probably combine 2 rooms together in an upgrade.;1
So arrived here for a 5 night stay. Perfect location. The receptionist greet wasn't great, she could have put on a smile, but it was no big deal! Rooms are small which was expected but barely a view to get excited over.  Beds were comfortable with lovely soft pillows, we both had a great night sleep every night. Windows are only double glazed so you can hear a lot of noise but when you've had a long day touring the city, you're ready for your bed!  Our bathroom came with a bath and a shower, which was a bonus. Enjoyed a nice long soak after lots of walking.  Towels changed daily, beds made daily apart from one day, where they came at 8.30am, we were only just getting out of bed but they still gave us clean towels.  You do wait for the elevators for a very long time, there are;3
Stayed from 21st July to 25th July. When we arrived there was a short queue for check in. Reception staff are lovely and the lady was kind enough to give us a free upgrade as my mother and her had shared a birthday only a few day previous which started the trip off well. Security at the lifts were always lovely and never any problems with them never had this at a hotel previously and always felt safe.   Rooms as stated were a bit outdated and small but expected this as New York rooms tend to be tiny and we have no idea what we would have done if we had the smaller room. Nothing wrong with the rooms. Beds were comfortable dry comfortable. We had two queen sized beds. View was beautiful and lovely to see the Empire State Building. Only thing I would say is about the tv few;4
Lovely hotel, friendly staff. The room was lovely, clean and oh the bed ❤️.... Location is brilliant. The 24 hour tick tock dinner is a bonus in the city that never sleeps. New York is just amazing, we can’t wait to go back xxx;5
was offered conciere service because we were members and staying for 8 nights, never happened!! several issues with elevators. would call for service/front desk and no one would ever pick up. air conditioning issues in room. staff not very knoledgable about area when we went down to ask . Overall we had a place to sleep and at least New York did not dissapoint!!!;3
It was our first visit to NY. We stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker which is located near everything including Penn Station and subways. The entire family loved the vacation with great food, museums, broadway shows, Trump Towers, Empire State Building, Ground Zero, Top View buses and sooooo much more. We loved NY.;5
The best thing about this hotel was the location absolutely fantastic, very clean and staff very helpful. Only downside was hidden cost of $400 deposit. Also upon checkout we had to pay $5 per bag to store in luggage room.;3
Stayed here for about 6 hours for a long layover in NYC.   Room was clean and well appointed.  Staff were efficient but a tad chilly....  Bed was very comfortable and we caught a few hours sleep after a red eye before heading overseas.  Location was great as we came in from Newark and it is right across 8th ave and up a block.;5
Very good location. I traveled solo and it was like in the middle of EVERYTHING. the subway is just a block away (Penn Station). Super busy hotel, but, all the staff was super helpful and efficient in all ways.;4
Where do I start, the AC IN THE ELEVATORS didn’t work so if you went from the 30 floor to the 1st and you stopped more than 3 times you are stuck in there for 3+ minutes. One of the days the hot water ran out. The “doorman” at the elevators are rude. They were understaffed when I received a package in the mail room and I had to wait a day to get it. The rooms are really small, they make them look big in the pictures. The AC inside the 2nd floor conference room does not work efficiently. Good things are it’s in a good location and it has a lot of history to it.  It’s way overpriced. Stay here one night to experience it then go to a newer hotel.;1
My family stayed at The New Yorker for Cosmopolitan New York Fashion Week and loved the vintage charm of the hotel. Security was top notch at the elevators and our family loved the restaurant on site. Hotel rooms were a little small but that is expected in New York. Location is fantastic with the subway and restaurants and Starbucks all nearby along with shopping, shopping and shopping.;5
The hotel was beautiful, old and full of character.  We were only there to sleep but was nice enough. The room was small but it served the purpose we needed.  The location was fabulous walked or took the subway most places.  PERFECT LOCATION!!;5
We had a beautiful room with a great view. The room was a great size for NYC rooms. The staff was extremely friendly. Beds were comfortable. The location was perfect, CVS and Walgreens right there so we could get drinks and snacks. We ate at both the Tick Tock Diner and The Butcher & Banker (highly recommend this steakhouse) The only negative (and we didn't come here to do this) was the tv channels were fuzzy.  I would stay here again!;4
Nice hotel directly at Penn Station, small rooms, but everything clean, always busy, loud lobby, no hotel for romantic stays, good and fast breakfast in hotels restaurant “Tik Tock, nice and good bar...;4
We had a one night stay in a suite overlooking The Empire State Building.  The view was the best part! The hotel was very very busy, check in was a very lengthy process due to the extended line. The staff apologised and were friendly. It was Gay Pride weekend so there were people everywhere. Security was tight getting to the elevators. Elevators were very slow and crowded and took a long time to arrive. Rooms were tired and old. However, it is an old building and some ‘character’ should be expected.  Whilst accommodation is expensive in Manhattan, this was not good value for money. We chose this hotel due to its proximity to Maddison Square Garden and for that it was perfect.;3
I was very pleased with my stay at the New Yorker.   I thought that the location of the hotel was great, right near Madison Square Garden. If you are someone who likes to walk, you are able to get to many places by foot from the hotel without needing to spend money on the Subway fares. The Hudson Yards sculpture pictured below is about a 20 minute walk west towards the river from the hotel. If you wanted to walk to west 42nd street, where there is plenty of things to do, it’s about a 10-15 minute walk north from the hotel. On west 42nd street is Madame Tussaud’s was museum, Ripley’s believe it or not, plenty of shops and places to eat. So it’s without a doubt in a fantastic location and if you like walking, you’re in luck.   The service was great. Check in time is at 4pm and my;4
I went here for a business trip to defend the north 2019. overall I enjoyed my room, everything was fine except for the fact that there was no fridge in the room, which is a BASIC BASIC necessity. i had to keep getting ice and i brought food and drinks with me. other than that everything was fine.;4
Overpriced for the small rooms and then since my room was to Shares between two adult males I needed a roll out bed and I was told that it would be $50 extra. I would have MAYBE paid it but there was no room for that in the already small room we had....pretty shocked...I’ve seen motels have bigger space for one third the price...;1
Because the hotel is well situated by Penn-Station and Madison Square Garden, it will continue to get guests no matter what standard it keeps. Unfortunately, we found the incredibly tiny bathroom and old carpets to be filthy when we stayed, and the amount of college students loudly being all over the place because a large chunk of the hotel is sectioned off as college dorms will keep up from staying here again. The food at the adjoining diner is just okay, but we did have a nice check-in experience with a lovely lady seated at the membership desk. Pretty large resort fee too, which didn't get us much except internet if I remember correctly.;3
We stayed here for 5 nights the hotel is ideally placed close to MSG and Penn Subway. Times Square is literally a 15 minute walk. All attractions close by to get to so for location this hotel is very good. The hotel has lots of history including a small museum and still retains a lot of Art Deco features. Staff very friendly and helpful beds are comfortable and rooms were cleaned everyday to a high standard. Our room was very small (I know NY rooms are small) but for 3 it was a tight squeeze. Room very dated and bathroom could do with some TLC as outdated and tatty in a lot of places. Please also be aware of the tax you get added per night for us this was an additional $180.;4
This hotel is across the road from Madison Square Garden and down the road from Macy's and about 15min walk to Times Square, the train station is right at the hotel's door step. We had a 1 bedroom room with a sofa bed in the lounge room and king bed in the bedroom a small sink and fridge in the lounge room. There was a staff member on the door checking room keys when you returned before you got into the lift area. There was a pizza place across the road which was delish if you want a quick easy dinner in the room. The Italian restaurant onsite was also amazing with filling huge dishes. We ate at the Tick Tock diner most mornings for breakfast until one day when the waiter changed the total on our bill to include the tip that he thought he was entitled to, when we didn't put in;4
1st visit to New York and expected rooms to be on the small side at it is a city hotel, we had a metro double and space wasnt too bad but there is a lack of storage and bathrooms tiny but realistically how long do you intend to spend in your room. The beds were comfy, the staff were pleasant and liked the security at the lift area. The location is spot on can walk everywhere and subway right outside. Tic Toc dinner was great for breakfast. I loved the history of this hotel and yes it is not the newest and brightest hotel but that just adds to the overall atmosphere, would definitely stay here again;4
We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. Rooms were cramped and not adjoining as we asked, we were told they were on the same floor and that was the best they could do! No tea/coffee making facilities and staff were mostly offhand bordering on rude especially after we had checked out and were waiting for our taxi. We had to pay an extra £352:00 dollars for facility tax on top of what had paid our travel agent(travel consultants) and when I questioned it I was told it's just something they do and not all hotels do it and they could only apologise! Doesn't help my bank balance;1
"The New Yorker is the perfectly placed hotel for anyone wanting the full Midtown Manhattan experience. Right outside of Madison Sq Garden arena, with some fab breakfast places just a short walk away, it's a great, central base.  The lobby is very impressive, and looks grand and very art deco.   We stayed on the 29th floor, and although the corridors were a bit shabby and worn, the room itself was lovely, if a bit smaller than expected. The bathroom couldn't fit more than one person in, and there was very little space around the bed, but for two people it was comfortable enough. The bed was very comfy, and the tv worked well for late night ""help you fall asleep"" functions. The room was kept clean and the staff were all friendly enough, too. We didn't eat at the New Yorker and I'd";4
Stayed three days during hottest days this summer! Great room with comfortable beds and pillows. Great service. Good pancakes in Tic Toc diner and good pasta fagiole at the restaurant in the lobby. Great spread for good Italian bread also! One drawback...small bathroom with tight entry and exit from shower.;4
It was my first visit to New York and I was prepared for a small room as I’d read the rooms are small. At check in the lady said I was in a good size room as I was there a while (10 days). Room was lovely with 2 large beds and 2 full bathrooms. Lots of room for the kids to play and plenty of storage. Definitely not a small room. Sadly no view at all just a brick wall really.   The room was very clean and maid service was always on point. I am not used to a hotel without a kettle/coffee maker and I don’t think it’s worth the $25 a day charge this hotel want to make. Also no fridge which I didn’t like.   To enter the lifts you have to show your room card to security which I liked as it made me more comfortable walking around the corridors.   The hotel is in a great position, close;4
I enjoyed most aspects of this stay. The staff was excellent, the room was clean and the hotel is in an excellent location. We were a leisurely 15 minute walk from Times Square and our Broadway show, MSG is across the street and there is Subway access north and south without crossing the street. I didn't appreciate how pushy the Wyndham desk rep was when I mistakenly thought he was the concierge. He tried to psuh tour tickets and a dinner package on me repeatedly even after I told him I was looking for the concierge. Also, there is a kiosk with cheap breakfast options tooked in a corner behind the concierge that I didn't notice until after we checked out. But there is a McDonald's across the street, some great bagel shops nearby, a Dunkin' donuts around the corner and the;4
Watch out if you change tour reservation.  They’ll charge you for the full amount of your previous reservation.  I was told I’d get at least a partial refund, but they did not honor that. The place itself is pretty nice, but being shaken down for hundreds of dollars is not so nice.;1
Firstly I booked it cheapest through the actual hotel, and giving you gifts to like discount on trips and shopping.  Had a updated newer room, no complaints at all. Bed amazing, furnishings were good, so much space in a 2x Queen. Ask for a corner room you get double windows.  I’ve stayed in many hotels in NYC but this one really beat all the rest and its mainly down to the staff. A lot of NY hotels get a bad rep as staff being real New Yorkers are rude and miserable. I’m pretty sure these staff were New Yorkers and all of them were great. It was pride weekend when I stayed so it was crazy busy but each staff member still made you feel special an acknowledge you in a crowd. ! I would most def stay again.  Don’t bother with the diner next door found hair in food, across the street;4
The room we had wasn’t too small as some other reviewers have commented but it was in need of some serious updating. My sister arrived a couple of nights after us and her room was updated but on the second night there was water leaking from upstairs coming through a light. They had nowhere to move them too!  Only about half of the elevators actually work and for a period of time the side that goes to the higher floors was broken and we were on the 27th floor. Staff is as rude as everyone else in NYC. Lots of homeless people right outside the hotel. Convenient location to get to get around. Not that we went to NYC to watch TV but their DirectTV service went out one evening during a storm for an extended period and most of the time a lot of the channels were fuzzy. I wouldn’t stay;2
Fantastic hotel in a great, central location. As soon as we arrived staff were excellent, especially Mohammed who checked us in. We’d booked a view suite double (4 adults) and I e/mailed before arrival requesting landmark view. We got top floor with Empire State building view. Added to our great experience. Tick Tock diner is good and coffee / pastries every morning in reception are reasonably priced. Subway station right under hotel is convenient. Would definitely recommend New Yorker.;5
The hotel was fine.  Nothing special but a decent place to stay. Rooms were clean. The location is great and because of that I’d stay there again. Restaurants attached the hotel are nice. Good food and drinks. I’d actually give it a 3.5.;3
Waited in line for check-in close to 5 hours because of IT problems without information, drinks or any other help. In the end got a wrong room without terrace as paid for and got breakfast coupons as compensation after complaining.;1
I booked this hotel based on the reviews it received. However, when I checked in, I was quite surprised at the size of the room, which could barely have one queen size bed.  It is perhaps a good room for a business traveler but not for people who have come on a holiday.  The hotel staff was courteous and helpful, especially Jessica at the front desk was super helpful.  However, I had to check out the next morning because, for both myself and my daughter, the room seemed too small.    The hotel has lots of things going for it -  an old-world charm, lovely architecture, great location, beautiful restaurant cum a diner, and is probably value for money for people who would get a bigger room on higher floors.;3
The New Yorker Hotel in NYC is truly a Great Hotel in a perfect location in the center of Manhattan for easy access to everything Wonderful and helpful Staff at every level We'll certainly be back 😀😀😀;5
Staff are slow, rude and belittling. If you look under 40 expect to be made to present your room card every time you pass through the lobby whilst the couple next to you breeze through and be told to have a good evening all whilst your being interrogated for proof that you booked a room. Rooms are old. TV looks like it’s 30 years old. WiFi is terrible and you have to log in every time you use it. You can hear every word of the conversation behind all four walls in your room so do not bank on getting much sleep. It looks as though it has been in need of a refurb for about 30 years if not more. Good location and it looks cool from the outside are the only two pluses. I’ve stayed in better in NYC for the same money. I actively avoided a Wyndham hotel in Washington because of my;2
"This place is always packed because it's generally one of the cheapest ""name brand"" hotels in Midtown and is close to Times Square, MSG and Penn Station.  Be advised, it isn't the terrific value it appears to be.  The affordable rooms here are TINY.  If you are staying as a couple, one of you will literally need to stay in bed while the other moves around.   The hotel has a nice lobby that borders on ornate, which is deceiving.  Inside the hallways and rooms have frayed carpet, banged up walls and chipped porcelain in the bathroom.  Speaking of the bathrooms, the rooms I've been in still use fixtures that must be 50 years old, and show it.  Many people come to New York for the first time and stay here thinking this is what you get if your budget is less than $300/night.  Trust";3
We had an executive room which was clean and recently renovated.   Luxury towels  Luxury bed.  The New Yorker is across the street from MSG making it very convenient for events. We attended the Billy Joel concert and after the show it was an easy Five minute walk. We ate breakfast and dinner in the Tic Tock diner and it was very good;5
For our first real visit to NYC, we opted to stay at the New Yorker as Wyndham points holders.  We were very impressed!  The Executive double room was spacious, comfortable (with central air) and had a lovely view of Madison Square Garden.  The beds were comfortable.  The bathroom was especially small, although there was plenty of room in the shower and the remodel of these rooms make everything very new and modern.  The wifi allows for plenty of connections, and is super fast and easy to connect to.  There is a Keurig coffee maker in these rooms, and a CVS across the street, so getting K cups and creamer was super easy.  There is also a nice cold mini-fridge and an excellent insulated ice bucket.  I'm not sure it can get much better for location.  Penn Station subway station is;5
This is a classic old NY hotel that is great if you need to be close to Madison Square Gardens or Penn Station.  Otherwise, there is not much around.  If you are in NY to see Broadway shows, you're better off at a hotel closer to the Theater District.;3
Already informed staff, but slow response and rude. Account team just informed me they don’t know what receptionist check, they just charged by themselves. Issues cannot be resolved. Terrible service.;2
- The location is fantastic. Right next the subway station for links all across Manhattan, madison square garden is pretty much next door and it is only a short walk from the Empire State Building, Macy’s and Times Square. -There are loads of great pubs and restaurants 1-2 blocks away but if you decide to eat at the hotel the trattoria bianca has decent food and a relaxing bar. Butcher and banker restaurant also on site,  was very quirky in a bank vault under the hotel, but very expensive in my opinion.  - as a lone traveller, I found the room size (a standard queen) to be absolutely fine for my needs. However it would feel quite small for 2 people so be wary of this when booking. the beds are not queen size they are doubles, the bathroom is very small and the tv can be;4
Their computers were down.  I arrived at 11:45pm and there ere about 40 people in line already waiting to be checked in.  At 1:30am, I could no longer stay awake and slept on the lobby floor.  At 3am the line had not moved.  At 5:30am about half the line had been processed.  At 7:56am the couple in front of me who had been waiting since 8:45pm was finally checked into their room.    I decided to change my clothes and brush my teeth in the lobby bathroom.   I asked the hotel for a refund since I had prepaid.  They said they would see what they could do.  I have not been refunded.  Hotels.com has not been helpful.  I paid $203 to sleep on a dirty lobby floor.    Take my advice — spend the extra $50 and go to a nice hotel instead.  One where the staff cares about your experience.;1
I've stayed here many times over the years. I was coming this time with family & needed to check in early to get to a Yankee game. After speaking with serveral wonderful front desk girls, Nada & Ramona, I was able to speak with Customer Manager Megan who make sure there was no problems or issues with our check in. Thank you for that. The absolutely wonderful part of our stay was the treatment we got from all hotel employees after our game when there was a blackout in NYC. The lobby thankfully was lit up and comfortable. They served all of us there water and what ever was needed, it was a calm, safe environment to be in. There was a lot going on, wonderful firemen and police taking care of people in elevators & anything going on outside. I am so thankful I chose to stay in the;5
We needed 2 rooms for our family, mohammed went out of his way to accomodate us. Staff are very friendly and professional. Rooms were clean. We enjoyed our time in the new yorker and would recommend it. It is away from the histle and bistle of times square but still within walking distance;5
My family and I recently stayed at this hotel. What can I say apart from it is appalling! From the moment you arrive at the New Yorker all they are interested in is getting your money. We were early and told that we could pay a $50 early check in fee. I asked if there was a place we could leave our bags and was told, yes no problem but it will cost you $5 per bag (we had 8!) so I payed the $50. The room, tiny. I know rooms in New York are small but these are smaller than usual. The rooms are tired and dark. The bath was chipped and tiles in the bathroom were broken. The hotel lobbies are dirty and in need of fresh wining up. I booked a car to take me to the airport and was charged  $130 to La Guarda, which is a 30 minute journey! I was told to pay cash otherwise it would cost me;1
My wife and I stayed at the New Yorker for the first 5 nights of our honeymoon  The staff were rude at check in we advised them it was our honeymoon and got the response “so what” We got up to the room which was unbelievably small, I went for a shower and the fitting coming out of the wall was leaking and sprayed all over the bathroom, We went down to the tick Tock cafe in the lobby for breakfast we ordered and they got my wife’s order of pancakes with bacon wrong they brought her pancakes with burgers and when told the server he said “well the burgers are nice everyone likes burgers” obviously she said no I would like bacon please and the server through us a dirty look and stormed off  The hotel is very dated, dirty and you are made to feel very unwelcome   I wouldn’t stay;1
We had a great experience at the New Yorker. We had a two bed room and it was very clean. We appreciate the refrigerator and coffeemaker and two closets for our family trip. We love the vintage decor of the room and the whole hotel. The location is ideal for sightseeing with a subway stop on the same corner as the hotel. Cvs is next door for forgotten items. We ate at the tick tock diner and had a great meal there.;5
The rooms were too small. You had to pay extra to get a coffee pot or refrigerator. Bathroom was extra small too. But the bed was very comfortable. Didn't like that they put a hold on your credit for amount of stay even though you were paying cash. Location is good.;3
Although the New Yorker is classic and iconic it is also very loud. I know it’s not the hotels fault that the city of New York does their road work over night but it was VERY loud all night. Concrete saws, jack hammers and dump trucks literally right outside my window! My advice would be get an inside room or pay the extra cost to get very high.;3
Will not be staying at this Wyndham property.The room was a shoe box No amenities. The car we were traveling was damaged by the valet and Wyndham wants to claim that they hire that out,but we were billed by Wyndham.;2
We visited this hotel from London for 4 nights in Feb 2019. The location is it’s greatest asset, being right next to penn station, near numerous subway stations and right opposite a Taco Bell cantina and McDonald’s hello! 🤣😂💁‍♀️  It’s a very busy hotel and when we arrived (a Tuesday afternoon) there were large queues. The staff were quite efficient though and we didn’t wait too long. The reception is a lovely spacious Art Deco area, with a 24 hour diner to one side which we ate in once (average)  The lifts are terrifying as are the corridors (they must’ve filmed the shining here)  The room we had was tiny which we expected but clean and well equipped. Bed was very small by American standards, the bathroom was very small and old fashioned, if we stayed again we’d probably;4
Hotel was clean, staff was friendly. Valet was top of his game! With the amount of people to deal with, they made it look easy! Easy access to subway. Liberty Bagel near by was fantastic!  Can’t wait to go back! I ❤️ NYC;5
My husband and I stayed here in early June for three nights. I had stayed previously many years ago. Having read reviews before visit I was a little hesitant to revisit. Check in was fast and efficient. Our room on the eight floor was fabulous. Beautifully decorated with loads of cupboard space, two big double beds and a huge bathroom and really quiet. We ate in the hotels restaurants. Food was good quality. Service from all staff in the hotel was excellent. The hotel is very centrally located. We walked a lot around the city but were also close to public transport. Loved our stay and will stay here again on next trip.;5
I booked on their website. When I needed to change the reservation, the front desk said I didn't have a valid confirmation # from the hotel, that it came from a 3rd party and they couldn’t help me.  What a rip off.  I had to talk to two different phone centers before they even put me through to the front desk.  I booked on their web site, not Priceline, Kayak, Trivago, Orbitz or Expedia but The NEW YORKER HOTEL A WYDHAM PROPERTY.  Moral of the story?  Skip the website and call your reservation in if you don’t want to get ripped off.  Or just plain skip the New Yorker - there are plenty of other hotels in the city with wonderful ambiance, great service, and web sites THAT DON’T RIP YOU OFF!!!!!!!;1
The hotel is dated but the experience was okay. Until I received my car back from valet and the molding down the side of my car was completely missing. Poor response from management of a blurry picture that showed the molding there when it arrived. Still no follow up from management. Nice area. Little over priced for the quality of the rooms. Don’t recommend parking a car here at all.;1
We arrived on Friday 28th June and were advised previously that we had been upgraded to an Executive Room.  We checked in and went to our room but it was tiny but very nicely furnished and decorated.  However with us being there for 7 nights there was no storage. We rang reception then went down to them and we were given a different bigger room for the 1st night then moved to room 3032 that is a much larger room with walk in shower coffee machine fridge stocked with water and cans of coke.  We also only had to pay $22 for the facility fee for the whole of our stay.  On our checkout day the following Friday we received an email off Thomas Cook saying our flight was delayed until the Saturday at 3.30pm. We went to reception and the lady who dealt with us was extremely pleasant;5
This is the first time I've rated a hotel favorably almost solely for the location, but here it is. What a fantastic spot right next to Penn Station. Staff were friendly although check-in/check-out was a bit arduous with a long wait. The reception area was lively at all times of day and the hotel is very easy the spot.  The room itself for Manhattan standards was acceptable, downsides including next to no counter space for toiletries in the bathroom, and everything was just a smidgen run down overall, from broken elevator indicators to worn carpeting/office chairs. Wifi was good/acceptable throughout our stay.  We had a view of the Empire State Building from our room (which was not quiet at all, but still within acceptable limits), so that was a welcome sight!  We would stay;4
My spouse and I booked this hotel for its proximity to Penn Station so we could get in and out of NYC by train easily on a crowded weekend for the 50th anniversary of Stonewall Pride celebration. The location was great. In addition, the staff is friendly, and the room was comfortable and quiet with a nice skyline view as a bonus. The adjoining Tic-Toc diner serves a good breakfast at prices that are reasonable. The $5 per bag baggage check fee for the hotel to hold your bags after check-out seems excessive and insulting to hotel guests, but overall our stay there was good, and i would recommend this hotel to others.;4
We stayed here for 10 nights. Not your average hotel stay. There were 2 of us. I’ve stayed here before but not for 10 nights. For nostalgic reasons and the history of this hotel is why we stayed here. We asked for additional towels which were provided but then were taken away from us days later while we were out for the day. At 6am each morning the smell of food woke us up. Not sure where it was coming from since there is no room service at this hotel. We had a nice view on the 35th floor but for 2 people the room was small. When asked if we could move to another room with more space I was told “no”. We moved furniture into the closet to make more space. The water temperature in the shower ran too hot or too cold. It fluctuates on its own. The sheets were not changed once the 10;2
Incredibly busy, centrally located hotel. Great for sightseeing or business base across the road from Penn Station and a stones throw from Empire State  - hence the rating of 4. But - brusque and officious reception staff on check in and out. Be aware of add on costs -  ‘Free’ wifi actually part of additional ‘facilities fee’ of almost $30 per day... and then also got charged an extra $5 per piece of luggage (cabin baggage and laptop bag) stored with concierge. For the total cost, would expect friendlier service.;4
This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. Love the Tick Tock restaurant with and good choice of reasonably priced food. The hotel is very well located to all points of interest. It is very well priced. Look forward to going back soon.;5
"While looking forward to our stay at the New Yorker Hotel, I received at least 1 email a day for 2 weeks upon confirming reservation on-line. Each email provided offers for upgrading my original booking.  Additional cost for upgraded room, additional cost for early check-in, additional cost for late checkout, and package additional cost for early check-in, late check-out.  This was concerning as I did not consider changing original booking for a 2 night stay. Turned out additional costs were billed regardless of my attempts to ignore as ""Facility Fees + Taxes"" were added for use of Wi-fi.  Room rate that I booked was for first night only, second night was significantly higher.  This information was not disclosed at check-in however, it appears if I paid attention to fine print,";3
I very much appreciated being close to the subway and close to all the theaters in midtown but the all-night noise due to the major construction work in front of the hotel was terrible. The rooms are small but clean.;3
I just completed my 3 day stay and had to laugh after reading some of the negative reviews. I booked through Bookingcom.  I had a pleasant stay -special thanks to front desk staff Afroza and Jose!! I arrived on an extremely busy and hot Friday morning. The check-in line was backed up and the large lobby was full of people. (It was Pride weekend)  It took me about 15-20 minutes to get prechecked in -I was very early and would have had to pay $50 to check in early so I decided to wait. I didn’t check my bag because it does cost $5 per bag. Despite the long lines, the front desk people were completely professional and polite.  Large groups of guests were staying from all over the world- I ran into a group from South Africa on the elevator. No one complained about anything.  When I;4
Stayed here many times for business and pleasure.  Close to Penn Station for train travelers.  Not far from Times Square.  A cool museum of the hotel’s history in the lower level is a good take.  For your occasional trip to NY you can’t beat it!;4
Stayed in the New Yorker during a recent visit to New York with my daughter.  Bedroom had new curtains and new bedstead, bed was extremely comfortable and room was clean.  Very good location.  Bathroom was very shabby, mould all around bath and soap holder, very mouldy smell from water coming out of hot and cold taps in bath. I have never stayed anywhere where bathwater smelled like this! Very unpleasant as we had to bathe and shower frequently due to temperature outside.  Washhand basin and toilet clean and air con very effective.  I am giving low score due to shabby smelly and tired bathroom. I did not expect this from such a well known hotel. Needs more upgrading.  You think it will be nice when you step into beautiful foyer. Disappointing!;3
"What better way to enjoy the big apple than to visit the iconic New Yorker Hotel! The 43-story Art Deco Hotel is located in an exclusive corner that grants easy access to the many fantastic places on the Big Apple. However, the truth is that the New Yorker does offer a backstage tour of this classic hotel.  Fact check!  When it was built, the New Yorker Hotel had coal-fired steam boilers and generators sufficient to produce more than 2,200 kilowatts of direct current electric power.  Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, the hotel was among New York's most fashionable. The New York Observer noted that in the building's heyday, ""actors, celebrities, athletes, politicians, mobsters, the shady and the luminous—the entire Brooklyn Dodgers roster during the glory seasons—would stalk the";5
The Wyndham New Yorker is a beautiful old hotel that is all updated and has nice clean rooms with beautiful views.The lobby is very warm and inviting. It is very secure as you need a room key to pass the person at the elevators. The fitness center is huge and has a variety of machines and weights. This hotel is so convenient to the subway, practically out the door. Also, very affordable for NYC.;5
"I booked a ""Queen Room"" for two nights. When we checked in I was charged an additional $45 per night and had to hand over my credit card for that charge. I assumed it was to cover any mini bar charges. However, when I got to the room there was no mini bar. I was told by the desk staff that it was for the ""Free WiFi and unlimited international calling"" I did not need international calling and the ""Free"" WiFi that cost me $45 per night was an unsecured network. Additionally, when we retired to bed we realized that the bed was a double and not a queen bed. When I complained to the manager on Duty I was told that ""all"" of the Queen rooms had double beds. I tried to explain that beds have names based on specific sizes and that you can not call a double a queen bed but I was told";1
i paid for the family terrace suite,,,, the carpets were gross,, the shower was boiling hot and never got fixed,, there was zero furniture on the terrace even though we asked 5 times and were told they would put the outdoor furniture on the terrace, but never did,,, the tvs are from the 1980s and are super small ,, you would expect much much higher quality for a wyndham hotel,,, i was so glad to leave this place will never go back;1
"The New Yorker is right on the edge of the Theater District but has good subway access so Times Square is one stop away.  Room was clean although ""tight.""  Good shower.  Fitness and Business Centers were accessible and not overly crowded.  We'd stay there again.  Usual Green Complaint:  Yes, the hotel wants to appear to be green and not change sheets or towels to save water.  But the housekeeping staff fears the supervisor inspection so regardless of what the guest wants, the sheets and towels still get changed daily.  We solve this by hanging the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign all day.";4
If the room had any size to at at all this would of been 5 stars but I've never stayed in such a tiny room and I was told it was one of the renovated rooms.  However it is located in the best area for getting to wonderful places and the beds had to be the most comfortable beds I've ever stayed on.;4
This famous Art Deco hotel was the perfect home base for our family vacation to Manhattan.  It is within walking distance to Empire State Building, Hudson yards, the high line, Bryant Park, and time square. If you don’t want to walk you can catch the subway at penn station located literally across the street. From there you can easily get to lower Manhattan, Central Park, Greenwich village etc. The rooms were clean, the tick tock diner in the lobby serves great food 24hrs a day.  I would recommend a terrace suite room. It had the most wonderful views of the city.;5
We stayed here for 4 nights in October 2018. The hotel is very nice and clean. Bedrooms are a bit tight for space as is always the case in New York hotels.   The hotel itself is very central and right across the road from Madison Square Garden and a metro to take you uptown towards central park. It is walking distance from the highline and 10 minutes from Times Square.   The hotel is very quiet and you don't hear any noise at night.   We would definitely stay here again on a return trip!;5
I booked this last year for World Pride. We arrive at 3pm and go to the Wyndham rewards desk to check in since I'm Diamond.  Get to the front and get told we have no rooms ready. I will swipe your card and you can check with the front desk later.  I replied that's fine but I'm not leaving this seat until you find us a room.  Magically I had a choice of 5 rooms!   Our room was upgraded good size room for NYC . The location is perfect! Subway right here and Macys for shopping.  Wyndham Diamond benefits - upgraded room, no resort fees and offered late check out.  This would of been 5 stars except for the check in process.;3
Our room with 2 double beds was more than.adequate. The bathroom was small but shower great with good water pressure. Beds VERY comfortable. Had 2 windows, could see Chrysler building from one! Room was quiet and clean. Carpeting in hallway a bit worn and signs of wear and tear present in hotel. Subway stations within steps of building.;4
Hotel is in the perfect location. Walk to Empire State Building, Time Square, Theater District. Easy access to Subway. Easy to get to and from JFK airport, just take the E train. Hotel was comfortable, room was clean, bed was very comfortable and view was spectacular! Hotel could use some updates with paint in hallways and rooms.;4
We came there twice in a week with huge queues to check in and out. The rooms are microscopic. You can go around the small double bed only if you have  no luggage...The only positive is that for a 40 story hotel they have an adequate number of lifts. At US$300 a room, never again.;1
Location is good, hotel was ok BUT when we arrived, we had 3 rooms booked and the receptionist insisted that we had 5 and that they were paid for. We had informed him that should only have 3 but he said that they would go waisted and insisted that we should take them. So we took one so our son would not disturb his partner who had arrived before us considering it was after midnight. We checked out after 3 nights with a ZERO bill and 2 months later received the bill for 2 rooms. They admitted it was their mistake however still charged it to our credit card without our authorisation. We didn't even want the room. I can just imagine what my customers would say if I made a mistake, gave them a product they didn't need and 2 months later insist they pay for it!!;1
"I was very disappointed with the New Yorker - a Wyndham Hotel. The only real ""pro"" was its location - on 8th Ave near Times Square. I should note that some of the rooms had good views of the skyline - my room faced another wall of rooms 50 feet away. The experience started with lack of service - the couple that I was traveling with had a restaurant reservation that they were going to missed (NYC traffic), so I volunteered to take their bags to the New Yorker for them to pick up upon check-in. Unfortunately, there were no bell staff anywhere to be seen in the lobby or anybody at the luggage desk (this was only 8:15 in the evening). I had to go out front to draft a doorman to help check in the bags. He didn't know exactly how (he wanted to scrawl a first name on one of the three";2
Stayed here for 4nights after my daughter and I left Miami the room was lovely two great double beds very clean and although hotel was busy our area was very quiet and peaceful we loved it I would recommend this hotel 🏨 we have been many times to other hotels in New York and can’t fault any of them.;5
The opportunity for early check-in was wonderful and the staff helped to secure us a room 'with a view'. The room was fine, however, would have loved one with a larger bath. I have stayed here before and love the location - close to Penn Station and dining facilities are great.;4
The New Yorker hotel is an icon for a reason. It is perfectly situated at Herald Square with a subway station at each corner of the hotel for easy access to the rest of the city. There are restaurants galore, including a McDonalds, Starbucks, and great bagel shop right across the street, which was perfect t for our kids. Macy’s Herald Square and much more shopping is a mere two blocks and the Empire State Building is also just two blocks away. On top of being perfectly located, it’s one of few hotels in Manhattan offering a family size suite, large enough to sleep 6, at an affordable price. As two moms bringing our two boys to the city, we appreciated the high level of security at the hotel. The hotel was accommodating at every turn, permitting early check-in, giving us a great;5
It is the first day of our 3 day stay here and so far we had a hotel staff walked in on us after I just came out of the shower and my husband was dressing! She did not knock and we did not call to request anything from housekeeping.  She did apologize but this should not have happened.    The hotel room itself is below 4 star standard.  The location is great but after today’s experience I would rather stay elsewhere knowing both us and our belongings are safe.;1
We are just leaving today and can’t thank the staff of this iconic hotel enough for making our 4 day trip so special. We had room 3220 which is a lovely large double room with an amazing view. The beds were comfortable , we slept well and we loved the old style bathroom, especially the shower. Better than any power shower.  The room was exceptionally clean and had great air conditioning . We couldn’t ask for any  more. A thoroughly enjoyable stay, and thank you to all the staff ( reception, room staff and the security/concierge)  for amazing customer service x especial shout out to Peter H on security x;5
What a difference five years makes since our last stay here. Dirty, unhelpful and rude staff on the main desk. We were glad to leave to be honest. Hotel is in a great location though close to time square and Penn Station.;2
Stayed at the Newyorker for four nights.   We enjoyed the spectacular view frm our room.  The hotel also provided us with comfortable beds. The hotel was also centrally located with convenience stores, cafes and retail shops close by. The Newyorker also has a comprehensive gym in the basement, which is a big plus.  Service was good. The reception desk and security people were friendly.  However, the hotel is quite old. The furnitures and bathrooms were not not up to a four star standards.;3
Our group stayed for 4 nights (I stayed 6) and we definitely got a feel for the facilities and surrounding area.  Some observations: - The rooms and bathrooms are laughably small (even for NYC).   - I do not see the value for the cost of this hotel (I moved to a different hotel that was a few blocks away for the last two evenings).  The new hotel was on a quiet street vs 8th Ave, was over $100 cheaper, and was better in every single aspect. - The staff truly treats people with noticeable indifference (they are not rude, but no impression was given that they actually care). - The locals who also live in this building show great disdain for the tourists staying in the hotel (share an elevator with them and you will understand).    After my company paid for approximately 62 nights;2
I just got off the phone with Nada, who is going to help me secure the room of dreams for a guest coming to NYC from out of the country. She was kind and helpful. THANK YOU NADA! We are so excited about making magic on this trip.;5
The hotel is a bit more expensive, the double rooms are very small.  The bathroom was dated, needs to be renovated.  Had to pay extra to leave our suitcases at check out reception on last day. This was not ok.;3
Neida on the reservations line was SO SO helpful resolving an issue with a reservation.  Very knowledgeable, patient and friendly.  This really makes a difference, not dealing with the 800 number robo line.  Thank you!!;5
My friend booked a twin room for us here on June 22nd 2019 as we were having a girls night out in the city and wanted to stay over. After waiting in a huge check in queue at 3pm we eventually got to our room which was horrible. The whole floor where our room was situated actually stank, as soon as we got out of the elevator we could smell a disgusting damp, dirty odor. The room itself was small, cramped and dirty, the bathroom was disgusting and even had excrement marks on the floor. On examining the beds we found pubic hairs on the sheets which had clearly not been changed since the last guest. We decided we just couldn’t stay there and went down to reception to check out and ask for a refund. We were told that the room price, which we had paid in full in advance, was non;1
"The New Yorker has clean small rooms, a friendly staff and is a good value; It is a short walk from Penn Station. The Tic Toc dinner in the hotel is good to get a quick breakfast before touring NYC.  Staying on the upper floors (above 20th floor) is well above the street noise.";4
We decided to book here for our weeks stay in New York City as it was very central. We were politely greeted and allocated our room. The room was clean and for a few extra dollars, we requested a fridge. One downside of our room was that it was very small, however we did not ask for another, perhaps they would of upgraded us if we had enquired. The gym was very good and the lobby toilets were impeccably clean. We ordered room service from the restaurant Tick Tock, that is joined on to the hotel which was great.  We would like to say how wonderful the lady is that tended to our room, 3129. Her name is Elena (P. I think her surname began with. She is a lovely Serbian lady). She was friendly, always smiling and made us feel so welcome and important. She very much added to our good;5
I love the history of this hotel and location! Decor was nice too. We stayed in 2 different types of rooms (one for a business trip then we got our own for a couple days after business). The suites rooms have a lot more space and worth it compared to the regular rooms which are nice but small for 2 people. Also the higher up the quieter the rooms!!;5
I took my son to NYC for a week as his 13th birthday gift, and we stayed at the New Yorker. What a beautiful hotel!! Excellent location. We stayed on the 39th floor and had a gorgeous view of the Empire State Building. It was a very memorable trip, and I am very glad I chose to stay at this hotel. We will definitely stay here again. Room was very clean, comfortable bed. AC was nice and cool. We had a suite and it was nice to be able to control the temperature separately in each room! We had a fantastic trip and staying here only added to that experience. Thank you!;5
The stay was great. The staff was very patient with a billing issue and very helpful for information around the city. Was in a room with an incredible view around and overall had a great time. Would definitely recommend it if you’re in town for a few days.;5
I chose The New Yorker primarily because of its proximity to Penn Station because I hate hauling suitcases on NY subways. The boiled price was fair but there was an extra amenities fee at the hotel.  That is  2 star loss for me right off the bat. The other star is for poorly paned glass windows and room doors that let in lots of noise.;2
Overall, another nice stay with our annual business group. The service was attentive and the rooms were very clean. The one star takeaway is due to the room size...just smaller than most of us are used to, likely due to the age of the hotel. Great workout area downstairs and a 24 hr diner next door.;4
Perfect location! We were upgraded to a suite which was wonderful. Old hotel but very clean and has its own character and style. As a bathroom snob, I was impressed with the cleaniless and how white the towels and shower curtain was. Tasteful decor throughout and great veiws of the city at night AND Nikola Tesla lived here! Would definitely stay here again.;4
Great facility, friendly staff, over all great time and can't wait to make it back to both the city and the New Yorker. Location is perfect for great sites like the Empire State building, Madison Square Garden and more. I would recommend this place to anyone.;5
Stayed at The New Yorker after a cruise. Started out bad with an aggressive woman who we thought was at the concierge desk trying to sell us a 2 hour presentation for a time share tour. All we wanted was a map and tickets to the Grayline tour bus. They need to better label the real concierge desk and get rid of the crazy lady.   The rooms are kind of hit and miss on the size and location. Some were big and some were tiny but with views. Rooms were clean, well appointed but the carpets and halls look worn down. Elevators were fast which was a plus. Hotel felt safe and secure. 24 hour restaurant was nice. Good location. Price was about right for mid Manhattan. They charge $10 a bag to store luggage until check-in time, which was kind of high since a lot of places it's free if you;3
On arrival first impressions of the hotel were excellent.  It was our 30th wedding anniversary and Jose at the front desk was extremely helpful and upgraded us to a room with a view of the Empire State Building.  The hotel could probably do with a little TLC as some areas do seem a little dated, including the room. This did not detract from our enjoyment and the hotel's central location does help to make up for its other deficiencies. All staff were extremely polite and helpful and unlike some other reviewers we were made aware at the outset of the additional charges (resort charges etc.). I would definitely stay here again if we were to return to New York.;4
"First impression of the lobby was good, but it all went downhill very quickly from there. Firstly, we requested a low floor upon booking (my gf is claustrophobic and cannot use lifts) but we had no response. We then emailed several times to confirm this, but still no response. Eventually we phoned ahead and they put our request down. On arrival, they put us on floor 21 - claiming they had no rooms lower down. Then, as if by magic, they find a 7th floor ""executive"" room which would cost us $50 per night to ""upgrade"" to. Not sure what the upgrade was - it was a smaller room with a tiny washroom (and only 1 bath robe). Probably made for a single occupant. I found this really opportunistic and callus of the hotel to get extra money from us. Next up, we had to locate the fire stairs";1
I stayed here for three nights and while the location is great and the hotel is ok, not great, the service was very good. However, on checking out, they charged me $37.10 per night for a “facility fee”. That’s for wi-if and gym and business centre. I objected and told them the features had said free wi-fi and I hadn’t used anything else but the desk manager said that this charge stated on my booking. We searched and sure enough there it was, buried on the third page, below all of the bits that said I had paid everything in full already. This was a sneaky “stealth” fee and I will never book this hotel ever again. The booking was already expensive - €717.28 for just me for 3 nights - but this is just punitive and if I had known I’d have to pay another $120 I’d have found somewhere;1
This place is old, dirty, outdated! We checked in to our suite, the couches were filthy and stained, the bar area had a garbage bin that was overflowing with trash that had probably been there for weeks. The bathrooms are gross small and outdated. Our bed made noise every time you moved. And it smelled like body odor. Do not stay here!!!!  They say online that the have been remodeled in 2019.... they are lying!!! And those pictures in their site are probably from 20 years ago! Save your money and go else where!;1
Ive stayed at many different hotels in NYC and this was by far the worst.  The hotel foyer and staff are lovely but thats where it stops.  The room was small, lucky it was only me staying.  The bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable, the walls are super thin and could hear everything from next door, i mean everything!   No fridge, no coffee machine or room service.   Great location but a run down old hotel which was uncomfortable, there are better hotels in NYC for the price you pay here.;2
I am actually here now. We love NY and are regular visitors. We normally stay at the Accor at Times Square and have recommended it to many. Thought we would try a hotel steeped in history. And as it had been renovated we chose The New Yorker.  Cant see what has been renovated. Cracked tiles in bathroom. Some mildew too. Wallpaper peeling in room. Very small TV. The bar is closed now for renovation. Internet said rooftop bar 👍🏼 and Coffee makers. Rooms are dated with no view on the Hudson or Empire State Building. Can upgrade to a view for 15 a night. No coffee making facilities in the room not even a kettle. You can have one for 25  a night though. No guest info in the room. Concierge not helpful. Colleague told us new management are terrible nailing cost to the floor and have;2
Wonderful staff and great location.  Have stayed there several years for more than a week each time.  Truly enjoy the atmosphere, service and ease of travel (A-C-E subway is below hotel with elevator across the street).  Also convenient to drug stores and eateries.;5
Older hotel in the heart of the action. We upgraded our room because the standard room was so small.  If you’re looking to do NY on a budget this is your place. Next time I will spend more money and go to a newer hotel.;4
Make a mandatory charge for services you may not want but they refuse to waive it if you do not want those services. Charge to store you bags if you arrive eraly or want to leave them for a couple of hours after checking out. Lifts broke down and we had to climb from 20th to 32nd floor but the staff were unapologetic and blamed the Fire Service. Room was cramped.;1
Ariana at the front desk had a very poor attitude.  She would not listen to me or answer my question, so I had to call my travel company to find my answer.  The other staff were lovely and helpful.  Ariana is the one bad apple in my entire experience at the New Yorker Hotel.  (also could have used a coffee pot in my room);3
We were really looking forward to our trip to New York, we got married in New York back in March 2019 and we stayed at the New Yorker hotel, the lobby and coffee ares looked really good but once we got to our room we were not impressed at all, the room was really small and very dated, carpet was well worn the lighting was dim, there was no coffee/tea making facility in the room which we are not used to, the only positive we can say about our stay was the bed, i cant remember when we have ever slept in a more comfortable bed, real quality. but sadly that was the only thing that was quality, i would not stay here again so therefore i can not recommend this hotel. we visited New York, Las Vagas and Mexico on this trip and for me New Yorker hotel was by far the worst one we stayed;2
I had a business meeting of four people and a bit of a sticky situation. The lobby was full, but Avelino took me under his wing, found a nook, moved things around, and made it possible for us to hear each other and sit together, undisturbed.  When one of my party arrived and happened to speak to him at the Concierge desk, he knew immediately where to bring them, and they were amazed that he had it all figured out.  Hats off, give this man a bonus.;5
We stayed at this hotel in August 2018 and the location was ideal for us as tourists.  The room was fine could of done with being renovated but I am sure they are on with this.  Beds were very comfy and no noise so with four us staying in the one room we were able to get plenty sleep after walking miles through out the day. Ate in the diner attached to hotel and it was fine.  Staff at hotel were always happy to help with any queries we had and helped arrange our  airport transfer.;4
The room was EXTREMELY smaller than advertised, Not only that, but a balcony at the hotel had a direct view into the room. I was extremely disappointed with the hotel considering the rate. Look elsewhere if you are looking to book in NYC and if you are looking to avoid the touristy areas, defintely do not book here.;2
We booked this hotel due to its location and we would definitely stay there again. After a long flight to JFK, simply take the air train to Jamaica then change to the Long Island Rail Road to Penn Station. Penn is directly opposite the hotel. There is also a subway stop just outside the hotel entrance and this served our purposes for sightseeing.  Check in was straightforward and they put a pending charge on our credit card for $100. They told us this would not be taken if we didn’t use the facilities. We didn’t and sure enough, the money was not taken. WiFi was free for us due to the company we booked with but we were told it was chargeable ordinarily.  The room itself was quite small but this was to be expected in midtown. It was also a little dated but it did the job. There;4
"This hotel is located in quite a central place with easy access to everything through the subway. Rooms are nice and clean. A bit on the expensive side though. We booked with breakfast included and we were really disappointed with it; only a voucher was provided to an in-house place which simply offered a juice glass, coffee or tea and 2 toasts (croissant or bagel) - probably the worst breakfast we have ever had in an hotel.";3
We booked via our travel agent. We had a room with two double beds which were reasonably comfortable. The room decor was good. The bathroom was small and a little dated, but ok. Water temperature is strangely set at 'hot'! the shower and bath cold taps were closed off. We used cold water from the sink, poured out of the ice-bucket, into the bath to cool down the hot water. The room air-con worked fine and was welcome. There are plenty of lifts. Some go from ground to floor twenty, the rest go from floor twenty to upper fortieth floors. The 20-40 floor lifts broke down one evening, which meant a walk up the service stairs from floor twenty to ours on the twenty fifth floor. The staff were mostly pleasant. We enjoyed using the Business Centre (in the basement) to access the;4
I stayed at the New Yorker in May with my wife and young boy for a weeks holiday. The hotel itself is very eye-catching and looks great inside. The staff here were very helpful and went out of there way to help us out with any requests or questions we had. We paid the resort fee's at the point of booking so we didn't have a shock when we arrived like others have. The room we had was good, it may be starting to look a little tired in places but it was still very clean, very comfortable and had great views. We stayed on the 33rd floor which had vending and ice machines just a few metres from our door which was great too. We also had breakfast at the Tick Tock Diner on a couple of occasions and it was really handy. The hotel's location is perfect. It is minutes away from the Empire;5
We stayed here for 4nights for a girls night. The hotel is in an OK location. The  reason for 3 stars is the service.  When we checked in early they said that they did have a room available but it would cost us $50 to get into it. I've stayed in hotels all over never heard of that. My sister called the reservations department and they told her that that is not true a fee should not have been charged. Also, to hold our luggage they charged $5 per luggage. As we didn't use anything at the hotel the $29 a night was also pointless, not like Vegas where your using a pool, gym, etc. The rooms are very outdated.;3
We booked with virgin holidays for this hotel and trip and the price you pay includes the resort tax which most people seem to get charged at the end of the hotel stay so we didn’t need to pay a resort fee. I contacted virgin holidays before travelling  and if you book this hotel with them you pay no resort tax. So the woman politely on the reception desk (who by the way was the most helpful person and giving us recommendations to go see places and places to eat) said she would lower the charge they hold on to your card whilst you stay to $150 instead of the $350 hold they place on your card because we had nothing more to pay which was great. The hotel is popular there was always people in reception and outside, our cabin crew stayed here as well!   There was only 2 of us and we;5
I used my Wyndham Rewards points to stay at the New Yorker 4 times last year-when 15,000 points could get a basic room-now it is 30,000 points. On my first stay I was a mere Wyndham Blue and I got  basic room. However on the next three stays I was a Wyndham Diamond and on each stay my room was upgraded: twice to an executive room with amazing views of the Empire State building and once I was upgraded to a Suite on the to floor.. If you are a diamond I highly recommend The New Yorker as a place to use your Wyndham Rewards Points. If you are paying cash I recommend you pay for an executive room as the standard room are small.;5
So the plus side the hotel is near Macy’s and you can walk to most things.Booking in the staff were all happy and were told we were fully paid .But we then got a bill for resort fees ! I politely said were were told when we booked in that we had paid in full.The woman on the reception was defensive and gave us a bit of a lecture! Add insult to injury then we get charged 5 dollars to hold onto the bags for 2 hours.;2
Stayed with nanny and baby in suite with 2 other children. They allowed us a 6pm check out time so she could stay with the baby in the room while he napped. So great. They originally gave me a 3pm check out time but I went to the desk to explain and Jessica was fantastic. Totally understood.;5
Very close to Penn St Station, this is a rather grand hotel that has seen better days. We had a a sweet little room with a view. My main gripe with the hotel is the rather large and unexpected 'facilities' payment that was added to the end - which was too much for the really poor wifi.;3
"During my visit to NYC my reservation was incorrect and I was over charged. Neida corrected my reservation before my arrival and informed her manager Micheal of the charge error. Micheal immediately refunded the money. Thanks I really appreciated the A+ service; they really redeemed my relationship with Wyndham!!!";4
This was our fourth stay at the New Yorker and we had a wonderful time as before. The hotel is within walking distance to many sights and convenient for transportation to all parts of the city. I wanted to give a special shoutout to Mohamed who checked us in Friday afternoon. He was simply AMAZING! He actually remembered us from our previous stay and went out of his way to make sure our stay and weekend was memorable. He is a huge asset to the hotel and the Wyndham brand.;5
Me and my friend stopped at this hotel for 3 nights. The entrance lobby was absolutely stunning and looked like it was from the 1920's. The room was small and slightly outdated but we didn't stop that long in our rooms anyway. The bathroom had a bath which was perfect as the weather outside was freezing and after a long day out in the snow, it was lovely to come back to. The window was closed but there was a breeze coming though which made it slightly colder in the room but there was a heating system so we didnt freeze. The bed was comfortable and we had 3 good nights sleep. We didn't really interact with the staff much but they seemed pleasent and happy to help. For the amount of time we spent in our hotel room, it was good eough for us.;4
Nice hotel, old like the most hotels in New York.Situated in very convenient location, midtown Manhattan.Just opposite Madison square, subway in front, Times square 10 minutes on foot, Macys 5 minutes on foot, Hop on hop off buses stops all around. Has to be noticed that rooms are very small;4
Me & my friend stayed here in May for 4 nights we booked two double beds. The room was small but beds comfy and as for New York your not in your room. The hotel is tired and jaded. Deffo needs a make over. Or even a lick of paint In places. It was clean. And great for msg concert we was going too. And the security to get to your room was a nice touch. But would I stay here again.. deff no , on arrival it was early hours handed over my credit card. Which was to pay the service charge, fine. As we had already paid for the stay via our travel Company. Upon our last day I got a call from my husband telling me we had a charge of £1500 on the credit card. Went back to the hotel and we had been charged for our whole stay and the hotel charges had been charged x 4 now we had already;2
I recently stayed 5 nights at this hotel on the 3rd June, with my husband and 10 year old son. Room was on 32nd floor with amazing views from both windows of the Empire State & Madison Square Gardens. Location was great for the subway & 10 min walk to times square. Room tax was only $22 per night and it was $5 per bag to store at the hotel on our last day. Staff were always very friendly & helpful. Fantastic trip to New York.;4
When we arrived at the hotel there were a lot of people standing around waiting. I was wondering why. When it was our turn to check in, we were initially told that our room wasn’t ready and it was almost 8pm. I told them I was a diamond member and they assigned us a room. We thought it was a good thing but we were wrong. When we opened the door to our room, it was a room that someone was still staying in. We walked right out and I went downstairs to complain. They gave us another room but it was much smaller and it was just horrible. The hotel is poorly managed and employees can be nice but don’t do anything to accept responsibility for their actions by making the stay a little better because of the unprofessional action of giving us someone else’s room that was still occupied.;1
Excellent service, great location, room service is fast and tasty, spacious rooms, if you’re staying in New York this needs to be your hotel. Neida in the front desk is incredible, she took great care of us during our stay, big thank you to her!;5
Wyndham group hotels are really useful when travelling, price is reasonable rooms and fixtures very adequate everything you need, Breakfasts are basic but sufficient, we always check this group first when looking for local accomodation and they are usually well situated for transport. Bar is ok and staff usually very professional and helpful. For the cost I'd recommend better than any other chain we have stayed with in US. Brits I think will find them not unlike Premier Inn but American and therefore better service standards than most low cost UK chains, although I'd never criticise Premier Inn they are good!;4
Fantastic stay, Mohammed checked us in and was very welcoming and accommodating for our first visit from Wales, we stayed for a week and were upgraded to an executive room, room was very clean, and of an adequate size, plenty of tea and coffee making facilities and a fantastic location outside MSG, amazing for the price;5
Stayed at the Hotel New Yorker when we took in a Billy Joel concert at Madison Square Garden. I had heard horror stories about small dirty hotels in NYC but the Hotel New Yorker gave us a large clean room with a beautiful view and a very comfortable bed for a reasonable price. We enjoyed our stay and will be back again. Only quibble was the comforter struggle: too hot with it on, too cold without it.;5
The New Yorker, A Wyndham Hotel has a convenient location in Midtown. However, my friends and I found the room to be quite small. There was limited space for three people to move around in and at one point the water in both the sink and shower was brown in colour.;3
The New Yorker is a classic art deco hotel with all the amenities of a new building.  Great customer service, perfect location in Midtown Manhattan.  Comfy bedding, clean rooms, great view of the city and night lights were wonderful.  Will stay again and recommend to friends and family.  The adjoining Tick Tock diner was convenient and yummy.;5
Walking distance to train and Madison Square Garden. Request high level room for view. Room was ok. On site restaurants great. Lobby always mobbed, for some reason. Unsubscribe to their emails- otherwise you will be bombarded.;3
Just returned from 5 nights in the New Yorker  The hotel is very central and opposite the Empire State . The rooms r very comfy , we were on the 19th floor and my god I would feel so sorry for ones on lower levels, the noise is wild , cars beeping and sirens etc, all day and night long, the windows r not sound proof but I suppose that can’t be helped . We also met some of the strangest people we have every met. Overall the staff r very friendly and welcoming and rooms r spotless and comfy and opposite Macy’s shopping mall , McDonald’s and Starbucks;4
"The staff here are superb, very helpful and very friendly, the room was clean and spacious, the beds are very comfortable, the view from our room was stunning,  the only down side was the ""facilities"" charge, (about $30) a day. for the gym, business center and Internet,   you have to pay the whole lot upfront,  WEATHER YOU USE THE SERVICES OR NOT!!!!..... this was however the only downside,,  but to be honest it is enough to stop me rooming here ever again, iv been to NYC many times and never had to pay this,   its money grabbing and nothing else!!!!! No doubt they will try to justify it.... But you can't,   don't see why I should have to pay upfront for services I don't want!!!!!";3
This hotel is in a perfect location to go out and explore. Madison square garden is across the street, Penn station just a few minutes walk away. The empire state building a 10 !minute walk.....I could go on! The rooms are small but clean and the bed was comfy. The staff that we spoke to were very friendly. You can get a nice breakfast in the tick tock but it is a bit pricey when you can walk down the road and get a breakfast that's just as good for less. The 911 memorial museum is a must, you need to que for a ticket to get in before you join another que to go in. If you want to go to the statue of liberty go to battery park for your ticket not the touts that are all around as you may find yourself on a boat that does not actually stop and let you get off, it's just a photo;4
A bit dated but excellent for the price Had a room with a great view of Empire State Building   This hotel is ideal as close to shops madison square gardens across the road. Close to time square. Value for money;4
Didn’t have AC in room night before my daughters college graduation at Hulu Theatre across street.  No sleep.  I have stayed here before without a problem years prior.  Seems we got the older part of hotel that weekend.;2
Stayed with my wife and son for a week at the end of May. Very comfortable room with air conditioning. Staff very helpful and obliging and were always available. A special thanks to Mohammed in reception who gave us a room with a lovely view. The hotel is very central and and the door staff were always on hand to call a taxi when needed. I would definitely stay here again. The Tic Toc restaurant serves a great variety of food and is open 24 hours. The breakfast there is especially good;4
Any decent hotel - especially one in a major city - provides its guests with a coffee/tea maker in their room.  Not, however, the Wyndham New Yorker.  If you want this very basic amenity in what used to be a good hotel in a most convenient location, you will be extorted to the tune of $25 a night!  The New Yorker has some lovely, comfortable,  refurbished Art Deco rooms, and others with great views of the Empire State Building - but it clearly can’t be bothered to make its guests feel welcome with this simplest requirement the for traveler.  That’s just shameful for what used to be a nice place to stay.;2
I have just returned from spending 3 nights here. We had to move room several times as the room cleanliness was very poor. First room had mould round the bath and a terrible smell. The second room was so small and had a window that was the smallest window I’ve ever seen. After complaining, the manager was called and he upgraded our room. Our room was a lot bigger and was better but still very basic. There is no fridge in the rooms like they say, there was no bath stopper either and when I requested one I was told to take a shower. I wanted a bath and it took them 45 minutes to bring a bath stopper to the room. Check in is at 4pm and check out is 11am, not what they advertise when booking. The location is very good but there is much better hotels to pick over this one. Left;2
The New Yorker Hotel is a good to made tours in New York close by the metro and Pen Station. Hotel rooms are clean and bed is Ok. We are were now for the second time there good hotel to stay.  Best Regards, Piet;5
We spent five nights at the New Yorker in May. Generally it was pleasant, but I expected more. Focusing on the positives:  Location is very, very good - within walking distance of the Empire State Building, Times Square and a host of other landmark sites. For places further afield, the metro station is just around the corner and Penn Station across the road (making travel to the airport a breeze)! The room was immaculate. Thank you to the team of housekeepers who must work exceptionally hard to keep a big, busy hotel so clean. The room and bed was very comfortable. The room was a little on the compact side, but it's New York - you expect that.  The reception staff were very welcoming and very helpful - as were the security staff. We always felt we were in good hands. The;3
There was rubbish on the cloakroom and she was totally dusty. The blanket was dirty and stained. The lamps were dusty. In some corners I could not define if it was mold or dirt. There was a bloodstain in the bathroom on the wall. The drain of the shower was totally rusted, the crane of the shower also.  Upon arrival, nearly $ 400 was required as a deposit, although in advance the entire trip was paid. These were charged to the credit card and have not been refunded so far. Today is the 4th of June and on the 16th of May I left. An hour longer stay in the hotel room cost 50 euros. That's too much! The service was not exactly  friendly and did not prove to me until today what exactly was charged as a deposit. At my request, I always got only the information that it will be paid;1
"We stayed at the New Yorker for a week in May 2019. We generally enjoyed our stay: we found our room very comfortable; it was always kept very clean and the housekeeping staff are to be commended for this. The lobby is grand and beautiful; the elevators are quick enough for such a big hotel (it's BIG), and the location is unbeatable. Be aware though: it's one big money making machine for Wyndham. So a trip to the ""concierge"" is frustratingly NOT a trip to a concierge, but a trap designed to get you to sign up for timeshare. But, it's a good hotel in the context of New York's crazy expensive accommodation options, and we would recommend it to others.";4
Very good location in NYC. metro station is just around the corner. friendly staff that helps. walking distance to boardway musical. can walk back after shows. will certainly come back and stay at this hotel again;3
My partner, my son and I stayed for six nights in May. A beautiful older hotel in a very central park of New York, right next to 34th St Penn Station & Madison Square Garden. Walking distance to Times Square and Empire State Building. The room was very comfortable - great beds and pillows. Shower was okay, the hot water kept dropping and pressure wasn't stable. Rooms were cleaned daily and great service. Security downstairs made you feel safe. Staff friendly. Would stay here again.;4
I’ve stayed at this hotel twice. Once in June 2016, second time in December 2018. Two different seasons and of course, different prices as well. People expect way too much sometimes. NYC is known for not being spacious at all, still, the rooms my friends and I got fitted us perfectly. The hotel has a great location. You can walk to time square and to the Empire State Building. The hotel personnel so always so gracious and helped us with everything we requested. If you’re looking for big spacious rooms, you’re probably going to pay a lot of money in order to do so. Otherwise, rooms were clean, staff was courteous and location was great.;4
The staff were friendly, pleasant and helpful, however the interior when leaving the nicely presented reception soon shown an outdated appearance. This hotel could do with a makeover and even the facility charge is essential to their services which I find is ridiculous that we had to pay for ‘facilities’ we didn’t even use! It was a nicely situated hotel within New York, the Empire State Building just up the street and Madison Square Garden just opposite. Even Central Park is just a 30 minute walk away. The room was small, queen room I might add, it was noisy with no coffee or tea making facilities! (Room 2553) - It was okay but I felt a little disappointed. There is a diner attached to the hotel called Tick Tock which is open 24/7 which is accommodating and do bare in mind if;3
We stayed 9 nights in this hotel.  I'll start with what's good about the hotel (but do read to the end for the cons): 1. The hotel lobby is grand and gives a great first impression.  2. If you love history, this hotel is full of historical moments.  3. It is a 5 second walk from the restaurant to the entrance of the ACE Penn Station Subway.  4. It is a 20min walk to Time Square, Chelsea, Empire State Building.  5. The rooms are sufficiently large (we had two queen size beds and enough space for 8 pieces of luggage), the air con is good. The Wifi is stable (I did an afternoon of work in the hotel) 6. The gym is decent with 4 treadmills. Dumbbells goes up to only 50lb so for those who train with heavier, it might be a problem. However, there are the standard machines but no racks,;2
The WC had toilet paper in the pan and long dark hairs over the seat. The bathroom shelf sloped so everything slid off. The room was tiny, with just a Queen bed with little room on each side (there were 2 of us). We had had a very long journey from Niagara Falls (thunderstorms on drive to airport and La Guardia closed for 2 hours) and just staying for one night so were too tired to try to change rooms. We had a prepaid room but were charged $29 plus tax when we arrived which seemed steep. When I checked out the receptionist asked me about the stay and I replied ‘the worst hotel room I had ever stayed in’ - pardon she said so I repeated my reply. I did say ‘you did ask but also that I was not blaming her, but that she did ask the question and therefore got an honest reply. She;1
The customer service was brilliant especially with the help of Mohammed. But never ever expect a big big room/bed or even bathroom for the stay. Apart from that, air conditioning was brilliant, towels are well clean. Is pretty well convience as well which McDonalds and Starbucks are just opposite and CVS are just across the road.;3
Lilia was so amazing and wonderful and helpful!! I travel for work and we had some confusion with the room, but she was sweet and friendly and patient and worked with us to figure things out. Thank you, Lilia!!;5
Hotel is affordable and in a great location....steps from Penn Station, 20 mins walking in each direction to Times Sq or Chelsea, pleasant staff but rooms are outdated> layers upon layers of old paint on walls, bathrooms not modernized, hotel hallways dark and lifeless! A complete reno project is needed!;3
booked sfbest limousine for hotel transfer from jfk airport. flight delay meant we were late arriving but had advised sfbest limo of our flight number. No one to meet us .transfer paperwork gave phone number to call. Rang numerous times ,never answered. on complaint expedia say we did not show for transfer.so no refund do not use sfbest, use yellow cab for about same price and save on stress from this organisation.  should have taken notice of reviews and nt booked with them.;1
Miguel was so helpful with us with the airport transferts etc ...  The hotel is modern, stylish and very good location. We didn’t have the chance to try the restaurant but we heard lots of good things about it.;5
An iconic building in a convenient area of Manhattan.  This was our first visit to the Big Apple and couldn't have chosen a more convenient location for exploring the city. A few minutes walk from the Empire State Building,  just across the road from Madison Square Gardens. Penn Street Sation is close by, as is the subway. Also not far to Times Square and Hudson's Yard. The building itself is beautiful, art deco style, and the lobby and lift area are amazing. Room quite small, and fairly basic, but very clean, and a very comfy bed and powerful over the bath shower, all you need really! The tictoc diner is good, as is the Trattoria. Would recommend for a New York break.;4
Spent a lovey 8 nights at The New Yorker Hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms were neat and comfortable. For meals there are three restaurants on the premises and a tuck-shop, making it very convenient. The location is excellent!;5
The New Yorker hotel is in a prime location. Close to many things. Almost next door to Penn Station and Madison Sq Garden! Parking is close. 4 diff restaurants. Diner, Italian. Steak house, and coffee shop. At Butcher and Banker you can eat in a vault!;5
Thank you for your service. Neida help me with my booking issue. I explain to her what happen and she told me she will have it  resolved in a couple of hours. She stated she will email me back or call and she did both. So if you have any issues call for Neida she is the customer service Queen.;5
Upon arriving in the hotel myself and my friend we're tired from travelling from Vegas and arrived early in the morning. We received no welcome from reception and we're sent to a filthy room which was no bigger than a postage stamp certainly different from the pictures we we're shown. I immediately went down to reception to complain to be told we would have to wait for housekeeping to come and clean it and we could not change rooms. Upon asking a family member to call the travel agent and ask to speak to a manager we we're then told we could move rooms hours later. The receptionist then made us out to be liars and said we could have changed rooms all along. The room was still filthy with rust all over the tiny bathroom however the room was bigger and we we're exhausted so we;1
it was a great hotel we loved it such a great atmosphere the workers were amazing and kept a great attitude at all times it is a great luxury hotel. and it is very near the empire state building yurrrrr.;5
My friend & I are native New Yorkers and we choose to stay at The New Yorker Hotel on our annual trip. We have tried other hotel HOWEVER we came back and won't go anywhere else to stay in the future. We had some requests pertaining to the particular room we wanted and the wonderful employee named NEIDA went above and beyond to accommodate our requests. We love going to this hotel because it's so convenient and  right near Pennsylvania Station, and attached to the TICK TOCK DINER where we ALWAYS GO FOR OUR BREAKFAST for fantastic breakfasts.  I wanted to write this review praising NEIDA for her professional, friendly advice and help. I was forced to choose a month and June is not there so I picked May HOWEVER our trip is in June so I will return to finish my review of the hotel;5
Upon checking in, there were quite a few people in front of us so it did take some time. When we got to the desk, we were greeted by Mohammed, who realised that my wife & I were on our honeymoon and moved us to a very nice room, room 839, at no extra charge and with a great view of the Empire State Building ( especially at night time ). Thank you Mohammed!  Staff at both Reception & The Information Desk were both helpful and informative. We attended Woodbury Common Shopping Outlet on our last day and we were able to buy tickets for the bus from Reception which was very helpful.  The rooms are functional and beds were comfortable but the only downside, and it may be stating the obvious, but as this hotel is such a central hotel which is handy to nearly all of the main areas in;4
On a girls trip, 5 of us. Reserved a double suite. Small living area, separate bedroom that was quite large, but the best surprise....the huge balcony!! It overlooked Madison Square Garden, could see Hudson River, Empire State Bdlg, and a tiny peek of the east river. The employees we have interacted with have been more than helpful and friendly. Especially Shapame at the front desk. Hope to come back many many times. Awesome stay!;5
After reading reviews prior to booking this hotel I was excited about our upcoming stay. To say the least after our visit very disappointed. Location is worth 5 out of 5. That is where it ends. We were on the 21st floor. The bed was meant to be a Queen size bed, it was not double at the most. The pillows were about 400mm square pillows. If living out of a suitcase you could only have one suitcase open as there was not enough room for 2 to be open. The room was very small. No refrigerator, no coffee or tea making facilities, plastic cups in the room. Then when we were checking out we were hit with a $30 per day facility fee for use of gym. I did not know there was a gym and therefore never used it but still needed to pay. I am unsure which rooms they have upgraded certainly was;2
"The Good - My wife and I liked the location, the security (you can't get to the hotel elevators unless you show your key card), the bed was comfortable and check-in/checkout process was timely.  The bathroom was a detraction since the toilet was installed crooked, the shower had NO SOAP DISH and there was an embarrassing lack of shelf space for toiletries (come on, no excuse when a small shelf would have been a big improvement). I had trouble regulating the water temp as it seemed either too hot or too cold.  Finally, there was a rattle every time the air turned on.  The Slow - OMG, ""premiere wifi"" actually meant that I could watch a premiere before a page loads. I did multiple speed tests and the download speed was .3 to .4 (you read this right).  Totally unusable.  Time of day";4
After my first day at the hotel, I met Maggie who was servicing my room and we got chatting about the area, good places to visit and beyond. Maggie is the friendliest person I have met since arriving in New York City and a credit to her employers.  Not only did Maggie help me with little secret places to visit that most tourists don't see, she also supplied me with a full supply of nice linen, towels and consumables to make my stay at The New Yorker go without any problems.   Maggie even helped me arrange a coffee making kit by calling her manager and putting in the request herself - a little thing that really does go above and beyond for the customer and put me at ease in this foreign land.   My experience has improved ten fold after meeting Maggie and I wish her all the very;4
Hotel is very 'interesting' with it's past history and previous guests,but the daily extras are a bit steep compared to others in the vicinity. Location is excellent and staff friendly. Our room was a bit small and the view wasn't exactly anything to write home about, but I guess what you pay for.;3
I have stayed at The New Yorker several times and I am always happy I did.  Nice hotel, great staff and I love the location. This time we stayed in a room with 2 beds (which were very comfortable), it was large, clean and had a nice view. Bathroom was sufficiently large for the 2 of us.  I will definitely stay here again.;5
I'd stayed at the New Yorker way back in 1963 with my family, so I wanted to repeat the experience. Check was fun, we hit at a bad time so we had to wait in line a wee while. I had booked 2 Metro Rooms one double and one with two doubles. On checking in I was informed of a $34 tax per night that had never been mentioned even though my voucher clearly stated accommodation and taxes. (I did eventually sorted this challenge out with my Agent,but it should not have happened in the first place).  The check in clerk was most pleased telling me he'd got the rooms on the same floor albeit on the opposite side of the huge hotel. The two double room was a Metro room but mine was not. So I popped down to reception who sorted out the second challenge and gave me a room just one door away;3
Let’s start off with the following, for a month prior to our stay not only did I, but also our travel agent tried emailing both reservations and concierge on multiple occasions to arrange an upgrade, bizarrely no one got back to either of us. When we arrived, check in asked for my credit card which I assumed was for bond...however I’ve now just found that my card has been deducted over $475 AUD in addition to the already $2300 AUD we paid for a weeks stay.  This is not acceptable, a charge like this should be discussed properly before charging someone’s credit card.   This room was seriously the smallest hotel room I have stayed in (smaller than my own bedroom at home). As a couple we have two suitcases, there was barely any room to store them which resulted in them being in the;2
Having been diagnosed with breast cancer, I decided on a short trip to NYC before all my surgery and treatments started. I have visited Europe on many occasions by myself but had never ventured so far as the USA on a solo trip. I arrived around 5.30pm and enjoyed a quick check in with the lovely reception staff. I asked for a high floor room and was not disappointed to be on 37th, with amazing views of The Hudson and of the World One building. Again, lovely large comfortable bed, nice sized room and wonderful maid service. I have almost finished my treatment and I have booked to stay at this beautiful hotel for five days in September 2019. The Art Decco Lobby is a beautiful feature of the hotel, and the coffee bar makes it a wonderful place to sit and relax with a great cup of;5
I visited this hotel 2 years ago and was so impressed. We went over from the uk and after the long flight the guy at reception gave us early check in and breakfast vouchers. We have just come back from our second trip to the same hotel and what a difference. The lady at reception was very rude and wasn’t welcoming at all. We also had to pay $29 per night facility charge which we had no idea about and never paid it first time there. We were very tired due to our early flight and couldn’t check in early .. then we had to pay to put our luggage in with the concierge. They have also taken out the tea/coffee facility in the rooms. When I get home to the uk and check my account they have taken two lots of money coming to over £200! I have no clue what this is for and I’m very;2
We checked in to room 3608. Small but has everything you need including iron/board. Housekeeping was spot on. My only gripe would be the hairdryer could only be used in the bathroom because there was no plug socket near the room mirror. Like the fact you can only access the elevators to rooms when you show a room key especially when the Tick Tock restaurant is open to the lobby 24/7. All staff helpful and very friendly. We arrived 3 hours before check in time but that was not a problem and were given our room key straightaway. Our view was 34th street all the way down to the Hudson. Also expended our check out by two hours without any charge. Would highly recommend this hotel which also has a great central location. Just a few minutes walk from Empire State and Madison Square;4
The position and the views from selected rooms are awesome. The staff is very helpful but as we and the staff acnowledged, it is huge hotel and misunderstandings happens a bit but the staff handles it every time. Been there now 7 year in a row and it will our future NYC hotel next year also.;4
This hotel is located in a great spot but that is pretty much the best I can say... For a 4 star hotel I was largely disappointed with my stay, the room was shabby, very noisy from within and out of the hotel, TV reception was bad and I ended up slipping and bruising and grazing myself quite severely in their non slip shower/bath. So much potential but didn't meet minimal expectations at all.;2
Stayed here luckily only for one night as that was enough,  found reception staff rude when we checked in, rooms are small and dated, I had emailed them previously to ask for one of the rooms to be a twin as it was for adult brother and sister? It wasn’t a twin when we arrived and when I rung they said they couldn’t give them a twin as the hotel was full. Wouldn’t stay here again if someone paid me!;2
Punctual. Comfortable economy seats. Staff service satisfactory but they left the last meal too late and had to reuse it. Food ok. Staff unsmiling. Toilets clean. Our luggage got temporarily lost due to slow immigration procedure not coping well with two big planes arriving simultaneously. Had to fly back with Virgin airline noticeable less leg room.;4
The New Yorker is in a great location!  It's right near Macy's and walking distance to so many things.  Beautifully decorated for Christmas...John and Anthony who run the transportation desk were great!  Full of patience and info.  Aveleeno was our driver whom we really enjoyed!  Our room was small but clean and tastefully decorated.  I would return and recommend The New Yorker.;5
I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The staff was very pleasant, room spotless, and the location is extremely convenient. I walked a couple of minutes from Penn Station to get there and walked across the street to the E train for the JFK train when I left. Saved a lot in taxi fares! The bathroom was not so modern and the amenities were just okay, but the whole experience was a positive one. Art deco lobby is pleasant to see.;4
great room, full of sunshine.  nice view and very clean.  very comfortable.  security is good and front desk was beyond nice.  we had just spent a few nights at the hilton midtown and we were more comfortable in the New Yorker.  location is very close to Madison square garden but not that far from Times square.;5
Myself and partner have just come back from a one week stay at The New Yorker. We had an amazing time exploring the city!   The New Yorker is in a great location if you are looking to do a city break. Most attractions are within walking distance such as Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building, Times Square, 5th Avenue for Shopping and The High Line / The Vessel. If you didn’t want to walk or you wanted to visit attractions slightly further away then conveniently Penn Station is right next door to the hotel to catch the subway to where you’d like to go and failing that, you can always flag down a taxi... There are plenty of those!   We arrived at the hotel slightly earlier than our check in time (4pm) so I was expecting that we would have to hang around for a while before;4
We celebrated our 36th wedding anniversary in New York and stayed at the New Yorker on 8th Ave. The location is excellent and close to all the great  attractions New York city has to offer. Upon arrival the front desk agent Samira was so pleasant  and helpful. Our room was beautiful with a great view of the Empire state building which we were hoping for. Samira is definitely a asset to the New Yorker contributing to the friendly warm environment that this hotel  has. Thanks so much for a memorable stay. We Hope to spend many more anniversaries In New York City and Stay at the New Yorker !;5
Lovely hotel. Decided on upgrade to two bathrooms, very reasonable. This hotel has style all of her own. Defiantly in the right place, all locations to visit so nearby. Definitely stay here again, soon hopefully.;5
I stay at the New Yorker frequently on business trips.  I enjoy the hotel's history and it's proximity to Penn Station and all the sights of mid-town Manhattan.  It's the staff at the New Yorker that really makes it special though.  I have always had a good experience with the professional and courteous front desk staff but my most recent stay was particularly good.  I had reserved rooms for my daughter, for myself as a business trip and a separate reservation for my husband and to stay in NY socially.  With all that going on, my reservation record was quite confusing and it would have been easy to assume that one of the reservations was mistaken.  Instead, Mohammed called me to ensure he understood exactly what was needed, and ensured that we all had a top notch experience!;5
This hotel is positioned in 8th Avenue and walking distance to all the main sites as well as the river.  All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful when asked for information. The hotel was clean and our room which was a suite very roomy with a separate lounge. This was our first trip to America and it was our Wedding Anniversary and the hotel upgraded us for free to suite with fantastic views on the top floor. Highly recommended.;5
Had a suite with two double beds, a sitting area, and a rooftop terrace with a view of the Empire State Building. Definitely a period hotel, but we had a great experience. Would definitely stay here again. The rooftop terrace was a big hit!;5
Stayed for 2 nights prior to a transatlantic cruise that left out of Brooklyn. We chose this hotel as I had some Wyndham points (transferred points from Caesars/Harrahs casino) and it was a great location. We arrived early since we had a redeye flight into JFK. When trying to checkin we were advised nothing was available but they could store the luggage. Mohammad at the desk was extremely professional and caring. Since we had not slept we really were not in the mood to walk around the city yet so we just camped out in the lobby for awhile (with a little nourishment from McD's across the street).  After a couple hours a room became available. Security is very good at this hotel as you have to show key to get towards elevator in lobby. I liked the building as it has alot of;4
"We checked in after arriving from Washington DC .. at 5+pm The front desk went through the motions & was trying to clear us as fast as she could. It came across like she was ""behind"" in meeting her kpi in checking in guests. When I presented my credit card to prepay for my stay, the machine asked for a pin#. After asking her if she is able to bypass the pin# process for the electronic signing,  she said ""we need a pin#"". When I remarked that other hotels in the United States & retail outlets allowed pin# bypass, she curtly replied that our machines do not.  Later, when I asked the security staff fronting the lift systems about whether there was a water cooler in the hotel, he directed me to a staff st the Ingirnsyion Counter. The man at the Ingornation Counter was puzzled with";3
I love the New Yorker. I am never disappointed with the room or the level of service. Just now Mohammad helped me check in and got me in my room in record time after finding out I just came in from South Carolina  Thank you Mohammad!!!!;5
We checked into this hotel on Friday 5th April & spoke to Mohamed who was excellent in getting us checked in after a long day travelling we were given a room on the 34th floor which had superb views of the empire state building one of the most iconic buildings in the world the room was comfortable would have been great to have had a fridge also housekeeping services were great. So glad we stayed at the New Yorker Hotel. The hotel has a lovely feel about it and the staff were so friendly and welcoming. The room was a good size, serviced every day to an excellent standard. Great shower, free WiFi, TV, hairdryer. The alarm clock between the beds even had USB charging points. The location was perfect, so central, we could easily walk to many attractions, some of the highlights were:;5
I had an issue with my business accommodations and Nada, the evening manager, was very understanding and helped with setting up everything. She definitely made my stay in new york a much better experience!;5
Hotel is in the perfect location, next door to Penn Station, across the road from Maddison Square Gardens and minutes from Times Square. There is a 24 hour restaurant in the hotel which served brilliant breakfasts! Rooms are basic but what you would expect for the price, and we didn’t spend much time there anyway so was perfectly acceptable for our trip. About an hour from the airport so best to prearrange transport. Very helpful staff. Great stay!;5
Location and staff are outstanding.  This place nickels and dimes you to debt and at the same time charges $35 resort fee.  The only benefit is free wifi (which you have to sign in everyday.  The food is awful.  Bathrooms are tiny and there is little space for toiletries.  Would never stay here again.  Would have given the place 0, but for the outstanding and helping staff.;2
Me and my partner had chosen to stay in the New Yorker based on a recommendation from her grandmother. The price was very reasonable for a stay in central Manhattan and the room surpassed my expectations. There only issue we had was with the shower. The temperature was hard to control either being too hot or too cold. The hotel itself was nicely placed, across the road from Penn station and Madison Square garden as well as only being down the road from the empire state building. If I were to ever visit New York again I wouldn't hesitate to stay in the New Yorker.;4
Across from Madison Square Garden and walking distance or a short subway ride to the theater district/Times Square. An easy walk to Hudson Yards and the High Line as well. Rooms are nice, staff was excellent and the hotel has an interesting history (check out the photos and other historical artifacts on display below the lobby!);4
When you get to the hotel it looks ok. However, step out of the elevator and you will start to get scared. The hallways looks very old they definitely need to be updated. Room size is OK but beds are very uncomfortable and even though hotel claim to be smoke free, you can detect smoke odor in the room. Some staff members are very nice and others well... Being this a Wyndham hotel I expected more;3
Stay away from this hotel, I was woken up every morning at 5am because my neighboring room took a shower and I heard a noise like a waterfall in my room.  hard pillows like stones. Bad smell everywhere, old carpet, small and uncomfortable bathroom.;1
First off, staff were fantastic and friendly, and went out of the way to give us information, offer service etc.  The hotel however... no hot water flask, paper cups in the room, unreliable water temperature in the showers, terribly outdated furniture and designs, television from the 1980s, mineral water not provided, dusty hairdryer, starchy bedsheets... the list would probably be longer if I stayed more than a night.   Only stay if you are a Nikola Tesla fan.;1
Arrived quite late check in was quick and easy very friendly staff ,was on the 22nd floor room 2274 ,room was bit small but it was clean ,bed was very comfortable but noisy but wot u expect it in new York city ,great location near to empire state Madison square garden and Penn station ,times square a 10/15 min walk away ,in all had a great holiday would stay here again;4
Recently stayed at this hotel for a girl trip.  Location is across the street from Penn Station which is great for getting to and from the airports....result!  Main restaurant is the tick tick diner, great food, great service!  The location enables easy access to all the main attractions via the subways or tour buses or you can walk ...about 15mins to time square.  The New Yorker is great, rooms are spacious and comfortable....we loved it!;5
Great location, close to 34th st Penn station and Madison Square Garden, Macy's and Empire State Building also near.  Room itself was small, no tea or coffee in room, slightly disappointed due to the price paid, However location made up for this.;4
This already overpriced (over $300 per night without breakfast!) hotel added a further $27 per day ‘Facility Fee’ when we were checking out. When I questioned this I was told it was a “tax”. When I then asked one of the managers I was told it was a “mandatory charge”. They tried to explain that it covered WiFi and use of the gym (which I didn’t even know existed as nobody mentioned this at check-in and we therefore never used!). Charging for WiFi was bad enough until we were then asked for a further $5 per bag to store our baggage after checking out! They want to squeeze every last dollar out of you. Be warned. NEVER AGAIN. And Management… PLEASE do not reply with your usual copy/paste “Thank you for choosing to stay with us… we would like to investigate your claims and make any;1
A small but really clean room with a very comfortable bed basic bathroom but again very clean. This hotel is near to everything we wanted to see with Maceys and the empire State building on your doorstep. Every one was very friendly and helpful although the drivers are absolutely crazy will definitely be going back to New York and to the Wyndham New Yorker.;4
Scored Billy Joel concert tickets in December for his show on my birthday.  Booked The New Yorker on booking.com for a great rate.  Got off the train at Penn Station, and the hotel is a half a block walk.  Short wait to check in.  Typical NY hotel room -- a little small, but adequate.  2 restaurants onsite which is convenient.  MSG right next to Penn Station, so just a half block walk to the concert.  Didn't  appreciate the timeshare sales pitch right after check in.  Will stay here again for the convenience to the train station and MSG.;4
This hotel has a great location and is the best feature. It’s directly across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station in Midtown.  The hotel overall is very old and the rooms are tiny. With saying that, this is what was expected when I booked in as I didn’t care about the room because I was visiting NYC and just needed a bed to sleep in. It is priced accordingly. The rooms are clean and functional.  It is very dated but has an old world retro charm. Check in and check out was a bit slow and could be improved.  The bed was very comfortable and the pillows also. There is a safe in the room and a small wardrobe to be able to hang jackets etc. bathroom is a shower over a bath and tiny.  No balcony or can’t even open windows. The AC worked great.  The attached diner was great and;4
Two words sum up The Wyndham.. Noisy and Basic. The room was small and dated but clean, I’m sure it had not been modernised for some time. If you want to enjoy NYC you are going to need a decent nights sleep and you won’t be getting that in room 2179. The windows may as well not be there as they are not keeping any sound out at all, even on the 21st floor all you hear during the night is sirens, garbage trucks emptying dumpsters, construction work and whatever else is going on in NYC, at times if thought my bed was in the street.  There was a little museum in the basement which was interesting and showed the hotel in it heyday. A good location but I won’t be going back.  The Wyndham charges ‘Facility fees’ (as do many others in NYC), these are nothing less than a scam, $31.75;2
"We have previously stayed here, and it was always 3-4 stars.   It has taken a decided downhill turn.   They charge for EVERYTHING!  Want early check in?  $50.   Late check out?  Same.  Or a 'deal' at $75 for both.  What happened to accommodating a customer?   Our room online was NOTHING like our actual room.   It was a tiny box, with stained walls, cracked tiles in the bathroom, burn marks on the furniture- generally, a run down flop house.  The hallway carpets were held together with strips of duct tape.   DO NOT order ""room service""!  It comes from the diner attached to the hotel, and it is dreadful.   Cold by the time it arrives, the burgers were a burger in that they were shaped like one....but tasted like some non-meat byproduct with soggy old french fries on the side";2
My third stay at the New Yorker. The no-frills standard rooms are tiny, but this time we treated ourselves to a suite. Two spacious rooms, large closet, couch, desk, dining table, 2 TVs, refrigerator and Keurig. Everything clean and quiet. Beware—the bathrooms are small with almost no counter space. Nice “pre-war” Art Deco accents. Location, location, location—right across from Penn Station. Easy access to buses, subways and LIRR. Helpful friendly staff. Will be staying there again!;4
Went to New York for my sons graduation and chose The New Yorker for its location. Close to where the event was and his job and such. I was a bit disappointed to see such a small room for the price I paid. I get the location was great but there were not many amenities, in fact all they had was a diner which was pretty good and a bar/restaurant and a workout room and they give you free WiFi. The views were amazing and I will say the staff was very pleasant. My kids were hoping to have had a pool but no such luck this time.;3
In the city that never sleeps the hotel bars and restaurants are closed at 10:30 ? But the diner was open. I went to have a nightcap at The Butcher and Banker and got the door closed in our faces by some rude staff. So why do they advertise cocktails to 12:30? Go to Nick and Stefs  for steak at the side of MSG. The shower water spills across the bathroom because its not contained in any way. Meaning its an open shower with 2 drains to collect the water in the middle of the bathroom. Mr Manager listen to me. Lawsuit waiting to happen. You can't walk into the bathroom without getting you feet wet?;3
My staff was not as comfortable due to the small room size and the outdated amenities. The bathroom is very small and I ran into the door several times. One must step back and to the side in order to close the bathroom door once in it.;3
Convenient location next to penn station and Madison Square Garden. We were able to walk to Broadway, Pier 83, Macy’s, Empire State Building, Time Square, and Rockefeller Center.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.   The rooms are not anything special and the bathrooms are long overdue for renovation. The walls are way too thin and you can hear everything going on in the neighboring rooms which is not cool.   We had to request a room change after the first night due to all of the noise in the room next door. The staff gladly moved us to a different floor without hesitation. The new room was bigger, the bathroom was also very dated and small, and while nothing like the previous nights neighbors, we could still here everything that was happening in the room next door.;3
Staying at the New Yorker is a step back in time, to a more elegant period. A short walk away from Penn Station, this large hotel has lovely small rooms that are well-appointed and comfortable. I had a grand view of the Empire State Building from my window. The gym is reasonably good, and the staff are very helpful. But it is NYC - this place bustles with energy and crowds.;5
Check in was quick. Loved the close position to Penn station. It was easy to walk or catch the subway to all the tourist spots. Room was a good size for New York and we had no issues with the hotel. Great stay.;4
We loved this hotel so much. Tons of history and the tick tock diner was so good! We got upgraded to a suite because it was out anniversary and it was absolutely amazing and had a private balcony. It was great.;5
In understanding that this is a tourist destination and location is everything, I have paid for hotel rooms at the same rate that had updated everything, made the stay feel comfortable and felt taken care of and heard. At this location, Art Deco is thrown around to hide the out-dateness of it all - from the dim lighting (even with all lights on), terrible shower head, TV reception out of the 80's, paper thin walls and promises to my simple request that was never fulfilled. To boot, the moment after checking in I was great by a rep for a timeshare. If you need to be in the center of it all for accessibility sake without the need for modernized amenities and comfort go for it. However, I have paid similar prices for a lot better. And considering this is owned by Wyndham, I would;3
We booked the New Yorker View Suite room and was not disappointed. We were on the 30th floor and could see the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden out of the windows. The suite had recently been refurbished so was very fresh and clean. We were impressed with the size of the bedroom, living room and kitchen. The bathroom was luxurious and the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.;5
Hotel room I stayed in was small but you expect this in New York however the room and bathroom is in need of updating as it looks tired and the bath looks like the baths in the 70’s, however it is clean which is the main thing but there are nicer hotels in the area;3
The New Yorker hotel is a great place to stay in the city because it is close to the train station, in walking distance to the Empire State Building, Times Square and great shopping and restaurants.  Convenient to the subway which took us to the museum.  Loved the atmosphere.;5
This is an older refurbished hotel in a great location.  The rooms are comfortable and clean and all of the staff are nice.  The subway is less than a block away and it is a short walk to the theater district is a short walk.  While the view from my room was limited, one person in our group had a view of the Empire State Building.;4
I was blown away with the quality of the staff from my first interaction at the curb to my last at the checkout desk.  The hotel itself is a tad tired but the energy and engagement of the team more than make up for it.  They clearly take pride in their service.;5
We have a reservation for the New Yorker  on 6/6/2019.  We are arriving very early in the morning as that is the best flight we could get that fit our schedule.  I called the hotel in advance to ask about early check in if possible. Let me tell you....I got the nicest most helpful person, it was such a pleasure.  Naida was her name and not only did she help with my question about early arrival and possibly helping us check in early, she also helped me with questions about sightseeing and places we should not miss.  My husband has never been to New York and is very excited, but we only have 3 days so I want to make the most of our time. Naida was sooooo helpful and friendly.  If this is any indication of the other staff at the New Yorker and how they run their hotel, I am sure;5
I really enjoyed my stay at the New Yorker! From the front desk staff, down to the cleanliness of the room. I’d recommend this hotel to friends and family! Can’t wait for my next trip to New York! See ya next time!;5
"I stayed here 1 night while in town for a business meeting. The location was very convenient and seemed to be right in the heart of everything (close to Penn Station and subway station, many restaurants/ food options, etc.). My hotel room was on the smaller side and a bit dated, but clean and no major issues. Minor complaint was the TV was pretty sub par in terms of very bad picture quality and minimal channels. I used the fitness room which I found to be pretty adequate for a hotel (decent amount of cardio options, some weight machines, dumbbells and enough room to spread out). I thought the resort fee was a bit high (31$) considering there didn't seem to be any real ""resort amenities"". Overall I was pleased with my stay and had no major issues.";3
Are you going to be fortunate to see a show at Madison Square Garden?  Well my husband got us tickets to see Billy Joel performing on his birthday to celebrate my birthday which was the next day. Energizing show to a sell out crowd  Sorry I digressed....yes the New Yorker was a great choice for a hotel. A 5 minute walk to the Garden from the Hotel. The lobby is historically Art Deco  from the late 1920s. The rooms  renovated. The bed comfortable, room very clean. The carpet throughout the hotel may need an update. But nothing too blatant.  And if you do not want to go far for something to eat. There is a steakhouse and a diner and I believe a 3rd establishment in the hotel. We chose the Tic Toc Diner for lunch. It was very good diner fare. Next time you want to stay over after;5
Beautiful and modern hotel. Perfect location at an unbeatable price. Neida was so helpful and accommodating, wonderful customer service. We are very thankful for our experience. Will visit again for sure!;5
Our room was very nice and above the skyline. Servers and restaurant were very good.  A coffee maker in the room would have been nice.  The room was clean and the hotel decor was truly art deco and electric.;5
"Three of us asked for and got a nicely refurnished room on a high floor with Empire State Building view, with no upcharge.  Prior to your reserved stay, you will get an email asking if you wish to ""request"" an upgrade to, for example, a suite as opposed to just a room.  Learned from front desk that this is saying you are requesting the upgrade on standby basis, i.e., if they are not sold out.  However, if you prepay for the upgrade, you are guaranteeing it.  In any case, we were pleasantly surprised by how large the double Queen room was; it could easily have accommodated a rollaway bed.  As for the Tick Tock Diner, contrary to some reviews, prices were reasonable for midtown Manhattan.  Two of us were content with the complimentary continental breakfast (the muffin, which I had";5
We stayed here at the beginning of May and almost everyone, continue reading, went above and beyond their position to help us with problems, questions, or needs. We had bicycles with us and the staff was understanding of us using the staff elevators and storing them in the room during our stay. The room was clean, the elevators efficient, and everyone friendly.  The only employee was one of the people at check-in was rude and unhelpful. Almost immediately a manager came to take over the check-in and because of the employee rudeness gave us a larger room and late check-out.  Everything about our stay was great and I would stay here again. The location is amazing with the subway on the same corner as the hotel, Penn Station 1 block away, another subway line 2 blocks away and;5
This Hotel is close to many top attractions, Empire State Building, Times Square, Madison Sq. gdns. A lively neighbourhood of bars and restaurants.  The Hotel staff are very efficient and friendly, especially Mohammad at the front desk. This is my 2nd time staying at The New Yorker. This time we traveled with our 2 grandkids for a special trip. We booked a double suite, which was expensive. We were disappointed, the furniture is worn and “tired” carpet  is all browns and beige drab and overall in need of renovation.  The sofa bed in living room area is uncomfortable. No lamps  in the living area, just a yellow  overhead light. The lobby looks much more attractive than the rooms. Security is good, room key must be shown to enter the elevator.  We enjoyed our time in New York.;3
The Pros: - The location can not be matched - it was just the best spot for access to everything (the Subway, Empire State Building, Times Square, the Vessel, Macys). It is a phenomenal spot and made the trip commutes around NY very easy.  - The staff were friendly and courteous.  - The lobby is lovely.   The Cons: - The rooms are dated and decaying. Our first room wasn't even cleaned properly when we went in and much smaller than the advertised pictures. We got moved to another room easily and that room was OK but barely.  We got to see next door's room and that was a little better so it's random how the rooms are allocated and some are better than others.  - Nothing really inclusive like other hotels. No mini bar, the service was also slow (took 3 or 4 separate calls for;3
The staff was very friendly and accommodating.   The hotel is only minutes from the train station, a few blocks from Broadway and shopping, and of course many restaurants as well as fast food.  We felt very safe at the hotel.  No one has access to the elevators without showing the room key. The mattress on my bed was SO comfortable. The room was not huge, but sufficient, and very clean.  The on-site Tick Tock Diner had delicious food, with very generous portions, and not extremely expensive. We had breakfast and lunch there.  We had dinner at The Trattoria Bianca.  It was fairly priced, and our food was delicious. We started with the Gorgonzola fondue. It was very generous with fresh vegetables and toasted garlic bread. Delicious!  I had the lamb shank, which melted in my mouth!;5
Just got back from a 5 night stay, room on the small side there nice and clean but for the time you spend in it it’s not too bad, staff are friendly and happy to help location is great. Would recommend.;4
We stayed here for four nights on a city break during April 2019 in a Metro Room.  Things got off to a bad start - the room we were given initially was quite cramped and had a window with a large gap which created a constant whistle from the wind and meant it was very noisy from outside too. We called reception and they sent someone up to look. He couldn't fix it and said he would either come back to fix it or tell reception to move us. We then went out to have a wander around the area. On returning, we found nothing had happened, so called reception again - they knew nothing about it so I explained the situation all over again and they did give us another room.  The new room had a much better feel to it - better layout and a bit more space. Bed very comfortable. All very clean.;3
Excellent hotel, more lifts than ever previously witnessed and all working very efficiently, staff marvellous, restaurant and diner in site although independent to hotel, perfectly placed for Madison Square Garden and Empire State building.;4
I booked this hotel as it is iconic on the NYC skyline. It didn't live up to expectation at all. We paid £170 per night plus the local tax on top, plus $75 for a late check out on the last day. When we checked in the lady said she would give us a free upgrade to one of the newly renovated floors higher up. I dread to think what the un-renovated floors were like. The room (3034) looked tired and well used, there was no view as the room looked over to another room, the room was very small. The room was clean, I just don't think it was at all worth the money compared to other places I've stayed. The location was central with lots of bars and restaurants nearby. It is a 10 min walk to Empire State and Times Square.;3
Arriving after what seemed like an endless flight we had a warm welcome at this hotel, just what we needed! We were also upgraded to a lovely suite which helped us celebrate even more! We travelled to nYC for my mums 70th!  We have stayed a few times before and will again.  Excellent location, clean rooms and friendly staff! You actually can’t ask for anything more in a city break hotel!;5
we just spend 5 nights at the New Yorker and were pleased at how central it was for us. We were able to walk to many of the sights (or take the hop - on hop off) that has a stops 3 blocks away Security was reasonable and I always felt safe;4
We recently stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker.  Our room was on the 21st floor and when we arrived on that floor we were disappointed with the dingy look of the corridors, although there was an apology notice evident as the hotel is undergoing refurbishment. I can imagine refurbishing a hotel of that size is not easy and so some floors will completed, others will not.   Our room was at the back, with views of a neighbouring apartment block.  We were disappointed at first, but it proved to be perfect as it was incredibly quiet, no road noises and we slept so well.  The room was a good size - something we had worried about after looking at reviewers' photographs.  Plenty of room for our cases and lots of room to walk about - pleasantly surprised.  The cleaning staff are evident in;4
We regularly stay at the New Yorker (at least 3 long weekends a year) and find our stays there to be consistently fine in every way.  For such a large, busy hotel, the property in general and our accommodations in particular are always well-maintained and the service is always courteous and responsive.  How the management and staff maintain a clean, calm atmosphere in an area teeming with activity seemingly at all hours of the day and night is beyond us!;5
We loved this hotel. The location was close to several prime sightseeing spots. The view from our room was spectacular. We loved the diner located in the hotel as well. The check out service was smooth and storing and retrieving our bags was a breeze !;5
I loved staying at this hotel in May. The coolest room service menu, friendly staff and prompt delivery, comfortable room and most accommodating housekeeping services. Great location too! Love the overall feel of the place and definitely one of the most unique and all-American hotels I've ver stayed in. A must return!;5
Carpet appears older than me. Reasonable rate. Room was European small but I expected less space across from Madison Square Garden. Great location. Walking distance to Empire State Building. Good restaurants nearby.  Had view of city from 27th floor so this helps make up for rundown appearance. Needs new bed. No refrigerator, no microwave.;3
Stayed 4 days at the New Yorker...small room by our standards but well appointed but you had to pay extra daily for a tea/coffee machine in your room.  Great location to Penn Station, hop on hop off bus route.  Very clean and comfortable bed.;3
"Needed to modify my reservation as a speaker at a conference on site. The phone rep canceled it, then transferred me to reservations to make a new reservation without telling me. At that point I was told there were no rooms. The next three days I attempted to contact any possible manager to fix this. (Again, I was a presenter at a conference they were hosting and flying from across the country!) Megan Buckhorn (sp?) was the only manager I was told could help. I called two days in a row and left two voicemails on her vm. I never heard back. Called from the airport terrified that I'd fly into NY late that night to have nowhere to stay! NO ONE helped and the manager still hadn't called. When I showed up, they said my reservation showed as ""canceled"" but put me in a room. The room";1
Stayed for one night in a suite room, great value. The space was small, but comfy enough. Both beds (including sofa bed) were comfy. Great to have individual air-conditioning and TV in each room. The bathroom was located inside bedroom, a little bit inconvenient. Cleanliness: 4/5. Will be better if equipped with a microwave. Great services and friendly staff. Received a 2 hr complementary extension on check-out time. Excellent location for subway and train stations, walking distance to many sightseeing tourist places.;4
"Booked due to proximity to Penn Station.  Originally for two nights so we could assess the level of noise disturbance having read previous reviews.  City noise is apparent even 21 floors up but as indicated in other reviews decent earplugs ensure a good night's sleep.  Extended booking to nine nights in total, easy to arrange back to back bookings and stay in the same room. 24 hour security checking everyone approaching the lifts gives reassurance.  Helpful staff and fast response  - requested a refrigerator to store insulin and it was in the room within 15 minutes. Lovely building with an interesting history - check out the ""museum"". Restaurant and diner either side of foyer - apparently independant of the hotel but internal doors link making it handy. Trattoria Bianca";5
Great location,hotel clean, staff were friendly welcoming lovely people the americans, tick tock diner was great full of locals staff great there too, loved it, food was good cocktails very good, i will be back. Thank you all.;5
It’s always great being in the heart of Manhattan. Hotel is a little old but it’s charming. And the location is top notch! It’s not as overwhelming as staying in the crowded Times Square area but it’s close enough that you feel like everything is accessible;5
So glad we stayed at the New Yorker Hotel.  We booked as a package with Virgin Holidays. The hotel has a lovely feel about it and the staff were so friendly and welcoming. The room was immaculately clean and there was no noise from the hotel or other guest, which made for a good night’s sleep (along with very comfy beds!) The room was a good size, serviced every day to an excellent standard. Great shower, free WiFi, TV, hairdryer, dressing table & plenty of storage space. The alarm clock between the beds even had USB charging points! We couldn’t have picked a better hotel!  The location was perfect, so central, we could easily walk to many attractions, some of the highlights were: Madame Tussauds, Circle Line night Cruise, Times Square, Water Taxi day Cruise, Big Bus Tour,;5
We just have spent 5 days at the New Yorker Hotel with our kids and everything was perfect: the beautiful room with very confortable beds and its amazing view, the staff with a special thanks to Mohammed and Megan (They are great !), the delicious breakfast at the Tic Toc restaurant, the beautiful bar downstair, and the situation of this famous « art deco » hotel in the heart of Midtown... We are looking forwards to come back and we do recommand this hotel ! Mr and Mrs Loussier (from Paris / France);5
I stayed at the New Yorker for 5 nights in mid March whilst visiting New York for the first time, with a friend. Having not been before we decided to book a package through Virgin Holidays and this hotel came up at a very good price (£250 less than we expected!). We were a little nervous having read some reviews but have to say we had none of the issues some others seem to have had. We were in a standard double double room, on the 29th floor, and it was just like the picture online. There was plenty of room in the bedroom, loads of storage, 2 big beds and a walk in wardrobe which had plenty of room for storing suitcases. The bathroom wasn't large but was fine with everything you need.  The hotel is old with lots of history and, yes, it is not all white paint and crome but it is;4
First time in New York for 60th birthday. Picked the New Yorker because of its proximity to Madison Square Garden where we going to see Billy Joel in concert. MSG just across the road, Macys and Empire State Building within 15 minutes walk. Also Penn Station is under MSG, ideal for subway use.  We stayed on the 21st floor, room small - about the size of a Premier Inn room - but clean and completely adequate. All staff were pleasant and the staff in the Tick Tock diner were very quick and helpful. The only crticism I would have is that you have no choice in paying a $22 charge for each night you stay, this covers WIFI, phone calls and use of the leisure facilities.We didnt use any of these so felt  a bit ripped off. Apart from that I would have no problem staying at the New;4
The Tick Tock diner is excellent. Lots of lifts in the hotel so you never have to wait. Unlike most hotels.   Rooms are tired and the bathrooms could do with upgrading. The hairdryer was awful. Mirrors not placed in rooms to enable you to dry your hair next to a plug.   Charged a facilities fee to my credit card when I didn’t use any facilities. I’ve already paid a fortune for the room and had to leave a tip, I don’t expect to be charged for facilities I haven’t used.;3
"Beware, this hotel charges an exhaubabent ""facilities"" charge per night.  FACILITIES include wi-fi, does anyone still charge for this?? And for use of their gym facilities. We didn't use these but still we were charges. Very disappointing.";1
I only needed a room for one night after a week long business trip in New York. The hotel was very accommodating and let us check into our room early. The room was very small but we only needed it to sleep so there were no complaints. The only good thing about this stay was the location, it was so close to everything that we spent the 2 days out exploring before our flight.   After check out you can also leave your bags at front desk (they actually number it and take it to the back) for a small fee and you can hang out in the lobby using their wifi until your ready to leave.   Overall I’d recommend this hotel if you’re looking to be close by to everything but it’s pricey.;4
Stayed as corporate traveler for a year. Reception very friendly and helpful ( especially. Mr. Muhammad ) Rooms are spacious, clean and cosy. Hotel guests are not noisy...so can sleep peacefully It was a very nice experience staying there;5
My brother in law and I stayed here on a 5 day trip to NY in April. If the purpose of your trip is tourism related, please read on. Logistically, the New Yorker is conveniently located a stone's throw away from Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station, and several subway stations .The A,C,E trains, 1,2,3 trains, and the LIRR to JFK stop here. The Herald Square station is a 7 minute walk for the N,R,Q,W trains. If you're flying into New York from JFK International airport, the New Yorker is very convenient. Just take the AirTrain to the Jamaica Station and purchase a ticket for the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) which takes you into the city near the hotel. Note that the entrance to the New Yorker is on 8th street and NOT 34th street despite the large sign. (If you're taking an Uber or;5
Arrived here for a birthday treat.  Checked in fine, although the lady on the desk was not too friendly.  We were on the 20th floor and it was very noisy and there was a draft coming through the windows, the aircon unit was super noisy too but worked well.  The room itself was very small but there was a chest of drawers, safe and built in wardrobe although not a lot of room to walk around the bed.  The room was cleaned every day and the cleaning staff were very good, bathroom was very clean but there was no extractor fan to clear the air.  The luggage lady was lovely and helpful and so was the information desk as they ordered a taxi for us on departure and was super quick.  The Tick Tock restaurant was good for breakfast (nice cup of tea) not cheap though. Was very convenient;4
My first stay in New York was welcomed with friendly Bell Hop and Front Desk Staff who accommodated my early arrival.  The room was comfortable, clean and with a lovely view to the Empire State Building.  Location was excellent. No fridge in room but I understand I could request one at a cost.  Room Key kept deactivating (my fault mainly because I had it with my phone).  I also found out leaving it near the TV or the Digital Clock could also cause this problem.  Location was perfect!;4
Stayed here for business for one night. While location is convenient near Penn Station, that's about it. Rooms are TINY and very noisy! I mean, I couldn't pull the chair from under the desk enough to sit down. The wifi was so bad, I couldn't do any work (emails mostly), forget getting on VPN. I gave up at some point and decided to do emails on the phone but my cell signal was just as bad. No music, no water, no coffee in the room, the bathroom shelf was so narrow, I couldn't keep my hairbrush on it without falling, never mind a little cosmetic bag. They charge $5 for storing bags for a couple hours - told me it was the requirement of the City of NY. BS! I come to NY for business every three weeks and always stay in different hotels, never ever was I charged for leaving bags;2
The New Yorker is our go to place to stay when we are in Manhattan. It’s right across from Penn Station which makes it easy as we travel by train. They have a separate desk for Wyndham members and they are always friendly and accommodating to us. During this stay, we were in two room suite with amazing views of Manhattan. The suites are cozy and very comfortable. I do concur that the rooms are smaller than hotels outside of Manhattan, but that is expected as real estate is at a premium in Midtown. Their rates are very reasonable and their location can’t be beat. The New Yorker makes it affordable to visit there frequently. There are also plenty of restaurants within an easy walk including two right in the hotel.;4
Our stay our the New Yorker was nice.  The location was very convenient to Penn Station and the Theater District.  Prices were decent, nice art deco rooms, Tick Tock restaurant next door great, house keeping very family, clean rooms.  Front desk was accommodating but the room was mixed up.  They sent me a confirmation about upgrading and early check in but I didnt get that room.  They told me I needed to tell them since it wasnt in system.  They eventually got us the correct room but did try and charge us mkre then promised.  Check prices and make sure you get what promised.   Concierge could have been nicer, he did not help and was sort of rude.;3
We stayed here for 2 nights following a cruise. The hotel has a good location for getting around Manhattan but that is the only good thing to say. The room was tiny you had to open the suitcase on the bed as there was no room on the floor. I have been to New York 4 times before but this was the only hotel with no coffee maker in the room and I was told I’d have to pay 28 dollars plus tax for the use of one. Also as we arrived early it was $50 to get the room even though it was available. The room was on the 36th floor and the soundproofing from the windows was appalling. The area around penn station is also not very nice. We have stayed in much better super 8 motels with better facilities. There are so many nicer hotels in New York than this one that are also much cheaper. Had;1
"The room was tiny, as were the beds. The bathroom was primitive, also tiny, but at least clean. The location, for many things, is good. The attached cafe is quite good, although our room did not include breakfast.  On leaving, the bill, after the Room Charge, and the various state and city taxes and fees, had a ""Facility Fee"" of nearly 15% of the total up to then, plus tax on that! This unadvertised fee, not included in the Hotels.com listing we booked through, is fully unwarranted, as we used no ""facility"" other than the room! This is fraud and theft.";2
Just returned from our 1st visit to NYC and were very happy with our choice of the New Yorker Hotel.  It's in a great location, very central to everything on our list of things to see and do!  The hotel itself is full of old world charm, the Art Deco design and décor a nod back in time to the 1930s.  It felt truly authentic.  If you like identikit/chain hotels that are the same in every city in the world then the New Yorker is not for you but if you want to capture a sense of old New York then book this hotel! Our room had a fantastic view down to the Hudson river and watching the boats sail by while having my morning tea is  a memory i'll treasure.  Rooms were immaculate and we slept very well each night.  Staff were pleasant and helpful.  No hassles on arrival or departure.;4
Very clean room and good bed. Room cleaned well each day.  A couple requests were responded to by housekeeping quickly.  Bill was correct and I checked in and out quickly.  Fun old pictures in basement. Also able to print my boarding pass in the business center.;5
"I stayed in room 2174, which was the size of a postage stamp. the shower head was leaking and pushing water up on the ceiling, the bed was really a hammock and the TV did work right. On top of that there is NO room service, no refrigerator in the room, and they charge you a ""RESORT FEE"" of $34 a day!!! The hotel is in need of a major upgrade! I was there for a conference so I did not select it but I would not go back to the conference if they choose this hotel.  Avoid this property because you will be disappointed.";1
For us, it was the perfect location for our New York trip.  Beautiful view of the Empire State Building from the front of the hotel. Easy walking distance to Broadway shows. Next to Penn Station and access to subway. Close to plenty of places to eat. Macy's flagship store close by. Having the Tick Tock Diner as part of the hotel was fantastic!  Our room was clean and neat. The bed was super comfortable. The staff were beyond nice.  We'll be coming back!;5
"Wow, we did not expect the reception we received, but were pleasantly surprised. Not only did the front desk staff spend time finding us a room that met our expectations, but they called to make sure we were satisfied, not once, not twice, but 3x!! This hotel has a staff that enjoys their jobs. So much so that the housekeeping staff refused a monetary tip and I quote. "" It is a pleasure just to serve you."" Where do you get that kind of service ever!!! Now this is an historic hotel. The rooms can be small if you are not using the guide provided by the hotel. The hotel lets you know, out in front, the square footage of each room. The staff will work with you to find the best option for your stay AND help you get an amazing view of the Manhattan skyline. We already started looking";5
The New Yorker is located across from Madison Square Garden and several subway stations and is a short walk to the Hi Line and the fabulous Hudson Yards.  While the rooms are small, the art deco interior is interesting and a good value;5
Just returned from the New Yorker after a three night stay. Everything was excellent, room , staff etc. Also it’s in a fantastic location, just walking distance to all the attractions. I will be returning soon.;5
Stayed for four nights on a business trip. Check-in was super fast at 8pm for me, but not for my colleague the next day because computers were down. Not sure how often that happens, but very inconvenient since he was arriving from a long international trek.   Definitely a historical feel, but standard rooms are tiny and not many updated features. Showers were very difficult to get a decent temp, several TV channels didn’t work (ESPN), outlets questionable, etc.   Beds are comfy and rooms are quieter than other similar hotels in the area. Staff was friendly in hotel and connected establishments. Location is solid with tons of options within walking distance, but not sure it’s worth the price, especially with the mandatory daily fee. Just include the $30+ per day in the room rate;3
Great hotel.  Clean and all the staff were friendly and helpful.  Great location for someone coming into the city to be near Penn Station to get into and around on the subway system. Definitely will stay there again.;5
We had a very nice check-in experience. Mohammed arranged a room for our family with an awesome view! First NYC visit for the kids and a good start :-)  37st floor at the corner, you can the empire at the left and one world at the right.;5
We just returned from a fantastic visit to New York, and the staff at the New Yorker went above and beyond to make it so! I was traveling alone with my thirteen year old daughter and her bestie, so safety was at the top of my list. Before we ever left, I called a few times and spoke with both Ms. Naeda and Mr. John, who helped arrange a car to pick us up at the airport, complete with the girls’ names on a sign. Mr. Gustavo drove us into the city and was a delightful source of information. When we arrived, we stored our bags for a small fee, and were free to roam about the city. We returned just before 4pm, and when I approached a gentleman to ask where to check in, Mr. Mohammed said have a seat over here and I will take care of you! I had requested a MetroView room with two;5
This hotel is absolutely dreadful! I was so disappointed. On a positive note the reception is beautiful and the location is good. The furniture in the room is ok, but the decor is tired and worn, layers and layers of paint, broken plugs, thread bare carpets, dirty grouting in the bathroom and no tea and coffee making facilities. We had to change rooms three times in total, the first was all of the above, but small and oppressive with the window looking on to a brick wall. The second and third slightly bigger, however the third room didn't improve cosmetically, but the view was amazing - The Empire State building, this was the only positive. The iron blow up and the toilet overflowed, insufficient towels etc, I could go on and on. I found the staff with the exception of Kada,;1
"After a not so comfortable flight and a stressful experience at JFK, we were looking forward to getting to the hotel that promised top notch service, beautiful rooms and fabulous views.  Well....  We were checked in by Lynn who I don’t think could have cared less about us if she tried. There were 4 of us in total; two couples and my friend had crutches. There was no “hello. Welcome. How are you? How was your journey?” or anything of the sort. She was incredibly rude right from the off when answering the simplest of queries and it seemed like everything was a real chore for her. There was another guest next to us who was making a complaint to a different receptionist and I saw her and Lynn exchange signs of exasperation and rolling their eyes between each other. I have never";2
We stayed for a long weekend. We were upgraded to a suite with a Empire State building view. The rooms were very clean and the service was great. We had dinner at Butcher and Bankers steakhouse downstairs from the hotel. We ate in the vault of the old Manufacturers Hanover. Our waiter Juan Miguel was a pleasure. We will definitely be back!;5
Upon arrival at the hotel the reception theythought we had arrived a day late and said we were a no show!! Thankfully we had our original booking paperwork to provide evidence that we had arrived on time - the member of staff didn’t like it that we had proved him wrong and his entire attitude changed towards us. He then left us standing at the reception whilst he seemingly worked wonders to find us a room. This is when it got interesting, the so called room, more like a cupboard with 2 double beds for myself, wife and 2 kids. The room window was a small single window facing a brick wall, so much for beautiful views eh!!! I called reception to complain and the rudeness of the member of staff baffled me, basically we were told he could not get us any other room and to call back in;1
The hotel was good and the room was adequate for the purpose, although the shower was either too hot or too cold. The staff were friendly and helpful and we had room service every day. The room was small, but adequate although, overall, the hotel could do with some renovation. What really surprised us was that, after check out, on our final day, prior to going to the airport, we had five hours from check out until departure to Newark. We were charged $5 per bag to leave at the hotel. As the alternative was to carry the bags around the city, we opted to pay the $20 but, I must admit, this left a sour taste.;3
Good location but the hotel is in need of renovation. Hotel staff are not helpful and quite rude. We asked for a change of room and the manager was not helpful. The carpets and bathroom appeared to be original installation. Basic budget accommodation certainly not luxury;3
Myself husband and son stayed here for a week in April and from beginning to end we were totally happy with our stay. It’s 5 minutes walk to Times Square and subway is right on the doorstep. Room was very clean and spacious, there was 2 double beds a desk, arm chairs and 2 built in double wardrobes. We had room service every day and clean towels if we wanted them also free wi-fi and a safe. All staff were polite and helpful. We will definitely stay here again the next time we visit New York.  I highly recommend The New Yorker hotel.;5
I was excited for this hotel due to its proximity to Madison Square Garden. When we arrived, I was happy to see the lobby was beautiful and the front desk staff was very friendly. However, when we got to our first room, it was way too small and we immediately requested a larger room. We did pay an upgrade fee and were moved to a larger room. However- this room was not very clean. The decor was old and dusty and there was black mold around the bathtub and window in the bathroom. We were so uncomfortable that we ended up checking out at midnight without getting any sleep, and just made the 3 hours trip back home. Upon checkout, no one thought it odd to ask why we were leaving so early, but again, the desk clerk was very friendly. I went online to provide this feedback to Wyndham;2
This place is awesome the pictures don’t do any justice it’s 100 times better. The staff are all very knowledgeable and will go completely out of their way to make you fell like your home even though you are not.;5
The New Yorker was an excellent choice while in town for a Billy Joel concert at the Garden. It is literally a 2 minute walk to MSG and Penn Station.  The Trattoria was a great place for apps and a drink while waiting for my GFs to arrive.  The room was newly renovated on the 30th floor and although a bit closer to the elevator, ice machine & stairs than I normally prefer it was still not loud. The room was clean and bed was comfy.  Great security to get to rooms as well. And again the location was key as you can walk to tons of attractions in the area ..Empire State Building, Macy's, & tons of restaurants.  This may be my new place to stay in the City!;5
Art Deco friendly hotel with great views.  3 adults sharing a room first room we were given was a bit small asked and given another which had more room.  Staff friendly and helpful, has coffee station in lobby, Tick Tock Diner with Starbucks & McDonalds across the road.  Handy for travel to airport using Penn Station across road.  Handy for so many attractions in NYC and saves time with all the walking and sightseeing that you do in the city that never sleeps - would defo recommend;4
Spent two nights on a business trip. The room was very small bit clean, quiet and functional. The elevators are very very slow. The location isn't super special but convenient.   This wouldn't be my first choice of a NYC hotel  but is a very nice option for traveling on a budget and very convenient location - next to Penn station and many subway lines.;4
I stayed here for 5 nights with my boyfriend. It was in an ideal location to get to everything that NY has to offer. It's within walking distance to the empire state, and the subway which is easy and convenient to use! The room was small and offered a view of a brick wall! BUT it suited our needs perfectly fine...after all who goes to New York to stay in their hotel room! The shower was lovely and the bed very comfy! Plus they do 24hr room service! The staff were very helpful and the hotel was very secure given it's busy location. All in all it was the perfect hotel for us, clean, comfy and situated right in the heart of Manhattan, I would definetly recommend this and would happily return in the future.;5
4 nights here booked through Virgin. Room was upgraded as we were celebrating my husband's 40th. Not sure what the upgrade was supposed to include? In any hotel it's purely a base for us so can't comment on any of the facilities. Excellent location. The hotel is tired in places and our room one of the smallest I've stayed in.;3
Stayed for 3 nights, where do I start, after coming from a stay in Vegas and San Francisco we found the rooms tiny/ cramped to say the least! We complained and were  told this is normal for New York?  If we required larger it's 75 dollars extra per night! As per previous review the art deco lobby is nice but always full of people. We were charged 5 dollars to store our case's after checkout having spent over 200 dollars per room x2 for 3 nights I would expect this to be free? Great location next to Penn Station in heart of Manhattan. Very disappointed !;1
The Location of The New Yorker was perfect for our stay in the city. The room was great. Checking in was a pleasant experience. The staff at The New Yorker was friendly and professional. I would recommend this hotel to my family and friends.;5
The New Yorker hotel is one of our favorite destinations.  The hotel is a block from Penn Station, and near the High Line, Bryant Park, the main Public Library, Hudson Yards and the Morgan Library.  Midtown and Central Park are also within walking distance, or just 2 to 3 subway stops away.  The staff has been unfailingly helpful during our stays. Check-in is efficient and quick. Sometimes we’ve been upgraded without asking, and been able to check in early. The hotel will hold bags for early arrivals.  The rooms are consistent with the hotel’s Art Deco architecture and always clean and well-appointed. We have had drinks in the Italian restaurant on the first floor but not had a meal there yet. The menu is appealing and reasonable. We liked the atmosphere.  The hotel also has an;5
Stayed here in January for 4 nights. we had a 2x double room and it was 4 of our birthdays. we had a free upgrade and free breakfast. Mohammed was just amazing so helpful, kind and funny. we paid $200 security deposit. the room was beautiful, had a view of the Hudson river which was lovely. we left a treat bag with a few dollars for the maids. tick tock diner we had dinner in on our 1st evening, food was lovely and service good. we also had our free breakfast her which was nice. All the staff were great, attentive,  cheerful and helpful location was just amazing.. right by penn station. time square 10 min walk, Macy's 5mins and the empire state was 5/6mins. I will 100% return to the New Yorker.;5
This was by far one of my worst hotel experiences - from the moment of arriving to the moment of leaving. I booked my room through booking.com and got possibly the worst room in the hotel. The room was shabby, smelly, the size of a sardine can and looked on to a concrete wall. Luckily, the one kind and empathetic staff member, Michael at the Front Desk, heard my pain when I complained that I couldn't fold out my suitcase because the room was so tiny, so he moved me to a slightly larger, renovated room. There seems to be a two track system whereby a reservation through booking.com doesn't get you a renovated room. In addition, as I was checking in at 12:30pm, I was asked if I wanted my room (which was ready) right away. However, that came with a $50 price tag (before tax), which;2
The New Yorker is a huge hotel with lots of large groups staying there. It's a bit older, but nice. The room was huge and comfortable. Staff was helpful. Got very crowded in lobby area because of the groups. The location is central to a lot of attractions.;4
I ran away to NYC to take a few days from reality and see a bunch of Broadway shows. The hotel was wonderful. I love the location. Check-in was smooth. It was easy to get to and from the Times Square area and right across from Penn Station. The room was spacious and clean. My floor was nice and quiet. The view was fantastic. I felt safe with security checking room cards before you got the the elevator area. I would definitely stay here again.;5
This lovely hotel is well-situated with convenient transportation, a fun diner in the lobby and clean, well-appointed rooms. We had a great view of Madison Square Gardens, could walk to the Empire State Building and many other attractions, but it was away from the crowds of Times Square.;5
By far exceeded all expectations, the lobby has the wow factor, glamour art decor, attentive friendly staff, booked a basic queen room, but upgraded to a double twin room with Empire State view as they knew it was my daughters birthday, very clean, and beds extremely comfy ,great location for exploring, won't hesitate to come back again.;5
The New Yorker Hotel - a Wyndham property – is a great high-quality option for NYC visitors that is affordable, wonderfully located, and loaded with style and friendly service.  We were particularly impressed by the welcoming and friendly staff, who consistently went above and beyond to answer our questions and provide excellent service.;5
"When you take a trip, especially to NYC, you want to have fun; you want to feel safe; and you want a little pampering.  The New Yorker gives you all three and more.  What a great hotel.  What a great location.  The staff goes above and beyond to excel in customer service.  When we checked in I mentioned to the clerk that this was the first time my traveling companion had been to New York and she upgrade us to a suite.  Oh, and if you happen to wake up at 4:30AM in the City that never sleeps and have a taste for a Chocolate Malt.  Just go down in the looby and enter the Tick Tock Diner.  The gentleman who served me said he has worked in the Diner for over 50 years. I was treated to some ""New York stories "" with my malt. What a classic place.";5
This hotel is perfect for people traveling though NY Penn Station. It's so close and convenient to drop off / pick up your luggage as you arrive and depart. The hotel is clean and quite. I've stayed here twice now and will continue to stay here for quick trips to NYC.;5
We spent two nights at this, the only great thing about it is it’s location (walking distance from Metro station), but it doesn’t justify the very high prices they charge in exchange to the value you gain hotel (We paid 632$ 🤪), rooms are very small, no fridge (or you can pay to get one), no breakfast included, not even a coffee machine or complementary drinking water! Fitness center is small, and there is no swimming pool, even Lobby is not a good place, for me this was my first hotel to stay at New York ever, but I wouldn’t recommend or get back to it 😇;3
My stay at this hotel was brilliant. Great location with the subway just on the corner if you needed to go downtown or Brooklyn. Room was clean and the views were great from my floor. I would book again if I am back in town;5
This hotel was in a great location, right next to Penn subway station which takes you anywhere in NYC. I liked that security was at the entrance to the elevators that went up to the rooms for safety, checking everyone’s room keys. I felt safe.;5
Our hotel stay was good overall. Our room was located next to the machine room running  the elevator, and the noise from the elevator woke me up several times during the night. The rest of the room was adequate. The location of the hotel was very good.;3
My 2 teenage daughters and I stayed at the New Yorker for 4 nights in April. Check in was quick and easy. The room was average, nothing fancy but clean and what I requested, 2 double beds. The beds were comfortable and we slept great. The room was small and the bathroom was also basic. Having said that we did not spend much time in our room so it suited our needs. Housekeeping was done daily and the tv worked fine along with the temp. of the room. The hotel felt safe and security was adequate with someone posted by the elevator to ensure people with hotel cards were the only people entering the elevators. There was no fridge and no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. There was a drink vending machine on the floor though. The best part about the hotel was the location. We;4
We used to live in NYC, so we know lots of neighborhoods and places to stay.  The New Yorker is our go to/stay at place every time we visit. It is convenient to Penn Station (we come in by train) and lots of public transportation options.  Right near the new Hudson Yards too.  Staff are very helpful and the rooms are clean (small, but then every hotel room in NYC is). I have no concerns about recommending this hotel to friends coming in from out of town.;4
Very pleased with accommodations, friendly staff, helpful and knowledgeable front desk and concierge! Will be back the end of May!! Have stayed here many times! Very central located, great food all around.;5
My significant other and I had a phenomenal experience when we stayed at the New Yorker at the end of May. We chose the hotel for it's proximity to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. We took the train in so we could attend a Rangers's game. The location was fantastic-- just across the street from Penn Station and only two (short) blocks from MSG. In addition to the location, service was fantastic. We had a wonderful check-in experience. The hotel felt very safe and secure, especially with an employee checking for room cards for everyone who used the elevators up to the room. The room itself was lovely-- very clean and quite comfortable. I highly recommend the New Yorker to those visiting mid-town Manhattan.;5
I was looking for a place close to the train station to avoid finding a taxi at rush hour. This is the place! There are over 1000 rooms in many combinations. I booked a suite so the teenagers could have their own room. The couch was surprisingly good to sleep on! Many elevators so we never had to wait. The front desk was friendly and efficient. The views from our 26th floor room were an added bonus! as was the balcony! There is the Tic Tock dinner in the hotel and we ate their for our breakfast each day. Would stay again.;4
Great location for sight seeing. 2 minutes from Macy’s for fabulous shopping. Rooms had great views of Hudson and Empire State Building. Tick Tock at the hotel was great for breakfast which set us up for the whole day.Pancakes and waffles were delicious. Irish breakfast was disappointing and cold.;5
Hotel is massive. 37 floors.  Its in a great location with easy access to Macy's, Empire state building and Times Square. Its clean but a bit dated. 24 hour diner attached but no hotel restaurant. Also expected bar to be open all night to residents but it wasn't. There are 3 desks in reception which is confusing and Concierges were a bit pushy. Staff not unpleasant but not particularly nice either.;3
My husband and I, and my brother and his wife stayed here for a night in March this year. We chose the hotel based on its location and when we booked online it seemed like we were getting a great deal. We paid a little extra for a room with a view (over the 20th floor) and we had a view of the Hudson in the distance and some nearby buildings.  The room was fine, a little dated and basic but comfortable and clean. My brother and his wife had issues with a blocked sink and toilet when they got to their room but this was quickly resolved by staff.  The location of the hotel was perfect, right beside Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. The Empire State Building, Macy’s and Times Square were all within walking distance. One thing that surprised us all was the actual cost of;4
Stayed at The New Yorker. On first impressions it looks dated but it is very retro. When you read about the history of the place you get why it looks like it does. Although the landing corridor and lifts section looked like a scene from the Twilight Zone or the Shining bit spooky. Our room was small but ok for us the bathroom again small and needed updating. We booked this in April 2018 and a month before coming we paid for my mum and son to join us. There room was on the front and was masive with a smaller room off the bedroom for storage. You had views of Madison Sq Garden and down the road the hudson river. It was a very busy hotel. There is a diner attached to it called Tick Tock and we loved it and did breakfast every morning there. The beauty of this hotel is its in;3
Came here with husband and 10 year old daughter. Perfect location from Penn station. Walking distance to times square, macys, empire state building and maddison square gardens. Yes double room is small but all you need for a city. Staff friendly and gave us room with a view. Bagel and pizza stores all around, will recommend.;5
It was quite a while ago now but thought I may as well give a review.  It is a very large hotel with so many rooms I don't think reception knew much about them but they persevered with our request until we found one with a view of the Hudson River so we were happy in the end. I was thrilled to stay there as it is quite iconic.;4
WWE. at the met stadium  .very easy to get to ..and what a venue ..we stayed in the new Yorker ..fab hotel...great value .with great views ..would book the hotel again ..  clean and the beds were like sleepin on a cloud   ..photos are night and day time views from our room ..;5
We had an excellent stay, really can't complain about anything.  Had read some overly picky reviews about bed firmness but ignore these because people have different bed preferences. We got a nice large room, I later learned that I booked accessible rooms without realizing.  Was concerned about reviews I read about tiny rooms but it's New York and it's to be expected so I was pleasantly surprised.;4
The location was fabulous close to Penn Station and within walking distance of the theatre district as well as Times Square. Close to the hub of subways at Penn Station which made it great to travel to various locations. The Tic Toc grill was fine for Breakfast and the service was good. Would recommend to others to use this hotel.  The staff were friendly and helpful when asked a question.;5
Stayed here for 5 nights from 3rd-9th April. Hotel is in a great location. Penn station across the road and Macy's down the block. We had a lovely view from the room. Yes the rooms are on the small side but manageable. Free safe in the room. Iron and ironing boars and hair dryer. One downside was we could here the pipes sometimes and got woke up at 6.30 am by this one morning. Called down to reception and they came up within 10 minutes to investigate. Tick Tock diner on site. Great breakfast but a bit pricey. Loads of delis nearby by for a cheaper alternative. Would definitely stay here again.;5
"I realize that people don’t always reach out when something positive happens; so I want to be the exception, rather than the rule. I have stayed at this hotel MANY, MANY times over the years. Its quite a charming hotel. The rooms are nice, clean, and comfortable; I like to stay in their suites to give myself a little room! The best part about this hotel is their customer service! I have never had a bad experience there! In fact, everyone goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is a great one!  Take my recent experience with Naeda, for example:  Naeda really took the time to help me during a call I placed a week or so ago. I called to request a specific room that I like to stay in while I stay at the New Yorker. I have 2 trips out there this year; both are very special. I am";5
Just returned from a girls weekend at The New Yorker. We stayed in a double executive suite with pull out couch(one bathroom) The room for 6 is quite small, however it was duable. The location of the hotel is great and convenient - overall the stay was okay. The hotel was clean and a bit dated. The staff was helpful- I would probably choose a boutique hotel for our next stay.;3
At a recent stay, I was not informed of a $29 Facility Fee before hand.  Apparently it is for internet, phone and exercise room.  Of course, as a Rewards member, I get free internet, do not use the phone and did not have time to visit the exercise room.    Please be aware that you will likely get charged for this -- no matter what price you believe you have negotiated.;1
This hotel is greatly situated. In the sender of Manhattan. Just a sort walk from many iconic New York attractions. After an efficient check in we went to are room. After the bright reception lobby of the hotel, the rest seemed a bit drab. The corridor to the room was looking a little tired. Once in the room, again in need of a sprucing up. Small to what I’m used to but clean.  The Bank and Butcher restaurant in the basement was fantastic. I didn’t eat there but the food looked good. I had a few Manhattan cocktails and found the price reasonable for New York. It never got busy in the bar so never had to wait for service. If you have a late flight. You can get a late check out. Three hours is $50, six hours $75. My only complaint is. On the day of leaving I required a taxi to the;3
We enjoyed a 2-night weekend stay in March 2019. Our room was comfortable, well-appointed and had a great view of the city. We arrived by train mid-day and the hotel was only a block from Penn Station. We had them hold our luggage ($5 per bag) until check-in, which gave us time to walk to Hudson Yards and climb the new Vessel structure there. Times Square and TKTS were within easy walking distance as well. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the 24-hour diner off the lobby was convenient. No complaints - we will be staying there again!;5
Stayed her April 2019 with 5 friends... No complaints at all... Position of the hotel is perfect... Cleanliness was fantastic... Staff were always happy and friendly... Would definitely recommend this hotel and would absolutely return again;5
"Nice hotel with a good central location, just steps from Penn Station. Check-in was nice and we (presumably) got an upgrade as our room was more of a suite. Only problem was the wi-fi in the room was horrible. Poor connection and the speed consistently dropped. We had a lot of work to do and had counted on being able to hang out in the room.  On the plus side, the water pressure in the shower was really good. (Not something I would normally remember...).  We had the ""no housecleaning/do not disturb"" sign on the door which housekeeping just ignored, too. Very odd.  In other news... The fitness center was pretty nice, especially for a hotel. The diner attached to the lobby was a good, traditional diner. Big menu and good food.";4
"Many hotels have facility fees now but when I booked directly with Wyndham these fees were hidden. My reservation receipt clearly stated ""Total for Stay"" = $348.67; charged $410.26 at check-out. Explanation I received via email: ""Thank you for contacting The New Yorker A Wyndham Hotel Customer Care regarding your concern. When booking on the web site for any Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. property there is an optional link in blue on the Pay page, which is the second step of the reservation process, where you can click to get a complete break down of both the room rate, individual tax charge amounts and cancellation policies including any deposits or fees.  It is here where it lists the facility charges of $ 34.08 per night plus tax."" Ridiculous.";3
The check in and check out process was easy. The hotel is older but clean. The rooms are typically sized for New York City hotels. Great location next to Madison Square Garden. Affordable and would recommend.;4
"I’ve stayed here in the past (purchasing the room through one of those discount room price apps), and was impressed, so there was no question where to stay on my sons spring break trip this year. Staff are professional from the front door to housekeeping. I enjoy being able to go to one of the busiest, and tastiest diners right downstairs 24 hours; this is ideal after a late night at a show or walking around Times Square. A few steps from MSG and Penn Station, so we can take our time heading to the station when departing. And, this has one of the best hotel gyms I’ve ever experienced, and I travel quite a lot for my job, and have experienced many hotel gyms.  So much history and convenience to everything NYC has to offer, I will be back next month; already reserved the room!";5
It was a few days away but we were so surprised by how fantastic our stay was at the New Yorker. We have already booked another stay there in May. The location of the hotel made getting around Manhattan so simple with the subway stop on the same block!;5
The New Yorker is one of the grand old NYC hotels, but it prices its rooms at an affordable rate.  Right across from Penn Station, it works well for business travelers coming in by rail.  Once there, I've found staff to be courteous and prompt on check in and check out.  If you use the fitness room downstairs from the main lobby, you take a little history tour of great music broadcast from the hotel.  The lobby itself is always filled with people.  On other trips, when I had time after meetings were complete, the lobby proved a great place to be.  I could use internet and cell phone and despite the crowd, it worked to get business done.  It's much more pleasant than wiating in Penn Station itself.  It's a short walk to lots of good restaurangs, and the hotel itself boasts some;5
A beautiful place in a perfect location!  The only reason for 4 stars over 5 is how many in our wedding party struggled to get room changes.  They need to empower their front desk to expedite solving issues.  Delightful staff though!;4
I was lucky enough to get this hotel through booking with a discount. And I truly hope I get this opportunity again, the hotel is located next to the 34 St - Penn Station and is on a 10 minutes walk to Times Square, pretty much the perfect location. There is also a Taco Bell Cantina in front of it if you guys are feeling hungry at 2 am.  The hotel itself is beautiful, is probably one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed on, given the opportunity I would stay here again and again. We got lucky to get a Empire State view and that was the cherry to the cake. it was amazing.;5
Our stay at The New Yorker Hotel was just splendid.  I have not been back to NYC in 10 years.  This time I brought my 7 year old daughter to see Frozen on Broadway.  I thought it fitting to stay at a traditional hotel centrally located.  The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful.  They granted an early check in,  a room with a tub, abd a surprisingly quiet end of the hall even though we were right within ear shot of Penn Station.  The manager Jessica and Mike were great as well as Jessica (who was a Trainee) and Miguel!  These folks know how to please and accommodate!  Jessica I would have never guessed you were in training.  Genuine and Charming!  We walked away with smiles and even stayed a second night!  Thanks ya’ll!  Also great location to The theatre district;5
We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights.  It is in a great location, next to Madison Square Gardens and Penn station. It is a very busy hotel. The staff were friendly and some were helpful, others not so. The rooms were old and worn.  There was also a lot of noise from the corridors and the surrounding bathrooms, it sounds as if the plumbing system could do with an overhaul. 5 am every day.;3
A lovely Art Deco hotel that is in a perfect location for your stay in New York.  Polite and helpful staff, nothing was too much trouble. The New Yorkers most famous occupant wasTesla and there is a ‘museum’ downstairs that is well worth checking out!  We will definitely stay there again!;5
We had a wonderful stay at The New Yorker. The location of the hotel is perfect-one block from Penn Station, making everything easy to get to. We took the train in from Newark Airport and used the subway to get around- very easy to do! We had two rooms for our stay-arrived at 10:00 am and the hotel stored our luggage. It does cost $5 per piece of luggage but that’s much better than dragging it around! When we came back at 4:00 one of the rooms wasn’t ready. Since we had dinner reservations and Broadway tickets for that night, they quickly upgraded one of our rooms to a room with two bathrooms.    The bathroom is pretty small, but that is the only downside to this hotel.  The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable!   The hotel staff was great-gave very good subway;5
My daughters and myself met my two cousins from The UK here for a quick trip. There was a hiccup at checkin, we had Shamage helping us checkin, she was awesome, gave us a suite, Mohammed Ali suite instead, it was a couple floors lower but the view was amazing. The tic toc restaurant Next door is perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner, the servers were delightful , they got to know us even after just a few mornings. The guys at the activity desk were so helpful, even if you don’t book with them, they assisted with directions and the subway. The hotel is centrally located, subway on both corners and attractions close by. Will definitely stay here again.;5
Big hotel with lots of amenities, efficient checkin and checkout, clean and quiet rooms, old-world charm. It has a superbly central location, close to all tourist attractions and public transport. There is a nice atmosphere. I can definitely recommend it.;5
My stay at the New Yorker was fantastic! It was very central to subway, transportation and tourism attractions!!!  The Hotel staff was outstanding!!!  All the departments heads)was very professional & knowledgeable!!!!  Went to See the NY Yankees!! The Bell stand was very helpful, arranged a personal Driver. $$ moderately   I’m a New Yorker ) was born & raised. I left about 29yrs ago.  I come to visit at least three times ) business & pleasure.   This was one of my best visit . Best Hotel !!!  Thank you,  Sincerely Yours, Madeline Ryan Performance Pilates;5
They have a counter near the front desk where the people behind it are trying to get people to Wyndham timeshare presentations. The problem is they did not actually inform us exactly what they were selling! They advised us that we would be going to a new Wyndham hotel in New York and reviewing that hotel. There was nothing mentioned about selling timeshare. They say you will get breakfast so you think you will get a decent breakfast at the new hotel however you are taken to the Wyndham office and given an awful breakfast.  As for the New Yorker Hotel room we had, the hot water in the shower was weak and we could not dial out using the phone. Atleast we got 50% off the “resort” fees for this. This is not a resort style hotel.;2
Pros: - decent location. - adjoining diner is good and staff in there are great.  - friendly doorman who sorted a taxi for us.   Cons/disappointments:  - booked two rooms at the same time 9 months in advance and requested rooms with views. Neither room had any view to speak of. - one room was vastly different to the other in terms of size and decor despite being booked at the same time and it being the same type of room.   - put a note on the booking and contacted the hotel additionally about it being my dad’s 60th birthday during our stay as most hotels do something nice. Nothing done at all. Very disappointing.  - maid service done daily but the bath was dusty every evening. Obviously not cleaned properly.  - no tea or coffee making facility in the room. Even Holiday Inns have;3
Really nice hotel could do with tea and coffee in the room for the mornings and the long shopping days  Staff very friendly and helpful  Central enough to all the sightseeing  and the total bonus a view of the empire state;4
Professional warm and friendly lady upon check in on the 28.3.19 and a lovely guy. Very accommodating placed my room next to my friends. Friendly concierge and porter on the door too. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to New York. Anyone looking for somewhere to stay in New York I highly recommend. It is a 10 minute wall to Times Square and a great view of the Empire State Building from your room!;4
Older No frills hotel in the Wyndham Chain.  Rooms small clean and cozy. Overall facility works for business and pleasure trips.  Bar on sure. Starbucks directly across the street.  Easy walk to Times Square, thigh you might consider other properties that are closer and possibly less expensive..;4
The hotel is in a prime location and is a well maintained hotel. All the staff I came into contact with were all very friendly . The room I had was 3329 on the 33rd floor but there are plenty of lifts. The room was quite small with a double bed and double glazing which is needed in New York, the room and bathroom very clean, great shower, the view was of other high rise buildings.There is an Italian restaurant on the ground floor Dmitri was a pleasure to be served by and even had time to interact with me and includes a bar. Also there is an American type Dinner Bar, food very good at both these locations.I would recommend this hotel to anybody.;5
Very clean rooms on the smaller size and we had supposedly a view of the city,  more a view of the rooms across from us on another wing of the hotel Easy access to broadway uptown or downtown, centrally located. Macy’s , Madison Square Garden within 1-3 blocks walking.;5
the room is small, no amenities however the TickTock is downstairs, and Essen is a block up the street. That said the quiet, housekeeping, the view!, the many and fast elevators make up for the lack of amenities.  The staff is exemplary!  We had to change rooms due to a loud mechanical noise and the front desk clerk (Ananda) took very good and quick care of us.  The view from the new room was spectacular!  Location? Penn Station is a block away.  Close enough to walk to Broadway and Time Square but far enough from the craziness of Broadway and Time Square. MSG is around the way and the Empire State Building is...right there.  I plan to return!;5
The New Yorker is a beautiful piece of New York City history with stunning Art Deco decor. The view from our window was absolutely beautiful, especially at night. The hotel staff works hard to provide excellent customer service, and that's a rarity in this day and age.  Penn Station is right across the street and Times Square is within walking distance. The attached diner (Tic Toc) is delightful and it's open 24/7.  When in New York City, I wouldn't stay anywhere else.;5
Was able  to check in early. Great location, nice cafe downstairs.  Very close to Penn Station, you can take a train to anywhere. Good security, have to have a key to get up the elevators, and they always checked. Easy check-in and check out, held our bags downstairs for us all day.;5
Very welcoming & comfortable hotel. Fairly central to Times Square but far enough of the beaten track.   The hotel has a basic restaurant which serves it purpose for breakfast with breathtaking views.   The rooms are comfortable. Varying in size & shape but ideal to settle down after a busy day!   Staff are very helpful & welcoming, they are also very informative with things to do/where to go. Concierge also very resourceful with excellent discounted tickets.  I’d recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to travel to New York who wants a bit of authentic Art Deco alongside their stay.   I’ll defo be back there!;5
Fantastic. Hotel New Yorker was the most friendless and organized hotel I ever stayed in. Tick tock restaurant was so delicious and prices were great. Hotel across from Penn Station. Great time all in all with family;5
Spent several days with family in Brooklyn then a short 3 day break in Manhattan. On arrival at the hotel I explained to reception it was my special birthday celebration. We were then upgraded & a complimentary bottle of wine arrived in the room. The two ladies of the reception staff were a pleasure to talk to & very polite. Just before departure on the 3rd day, the handle on my small case broke. The concierge Avelino obtained sellotape and made an excellent repair which lasted until we got back to England. The hotel although not the plushest of rooms, all the staff that we met - housekeeping, security, room service etc were very professional & out to please, which makes your stay in The New Yorker a very enjoyable experience;4
History and efficiency ooze from this place.  Built in the heyday of deco architecture, the lobby retains elements that remind you of a bygone era.   I last stayed here in 1994, when the property was sorely in need of renovation.   Recent upgrades made by Wyndom and other owners have transformed rooms and public areas from tattered to first class, but not deluxe.     The lobby always felt crowded as if it were an extension of Penn Station (conviently just 1 block away).  The reception also felt understaffed as a line to check in seemed to always exist.    But if you need a transportation super location, you can hardly do better, with subway C&E entrances on either side of the front door, a stone’s throw from Penn Station and easy walking to/from the port authority depot at 42nd;4
Stayed here for 4 nights week before Christmas last year. This was our third time to New York but first time at this hotel.  The location is great, we hardly got the subway to anywhere, the only place we got the subway was when we went further afield to Natural History Museum or The Oculus apart from that we walked everywhere.  Staff were friendly and hotel was dated but clean.  We always had a good nights sleep even with all the noise outside, I think we were on floor 23 but we still heard a lot of outside noise.  I would still recommend this hotel and would stay here again,;4
Great hotel small rooms but you expect that in new york . Great location 10 mins away from times square ,5mins away from empire state building and next Door is the penn station for the subway .would definitely 100% recommend this hotel .the photos I put up are from our bedroom;4
Just returned from an amazing week in NYC. Stayed at The New Yorker for its great location and accessibility to everywhere - this is where the hotel scores really highly with Penn Station right next door and easy access uptown and downtown. Hotel itself is iconic with some beautiful Art Deco features in communal areas, but rooms themselves are very basic and the general decor could do with updating. Staff are amazing and helpful but the hotel looks to tease out additional fees at every opportunity, $22 per room per night + taxes to use WiFi, TV and gym (whether you want to or not) plus $5 per bag for hotel to mind your case from checkout to pick up time. On the plus there’s an amazing restaurant linked to the hotel called Tick-Tock that’s open 24/7 and is the epitome of an;3
This was my third visit to the NewYorker and after comparing it with others (even higher end) I will only stay here.  Great location and the vibe of the busy hotel lobby is fabulous. It has such an old world NewYork feel.  Rooms are small but what else do you expect in NYC but they are cozy, comfortable and super clean.  Staff are lovely!    Highly recommend!;5
Would never go again. We were treated like the bumbs on the street corner. Our family were only in New York for one day and they ruined our whole day with their lengthy check in process. They then lied and said they were giving us a room with a view and pull out bed and we even had to switch rooms after 2 hours. This was the worse experience ever and hotel was gross!!!;1
We enjoyed our stay at the New Yorker Hotel.  It has a rich history (be sure to stop and see the display about this downstairs).  There are subway stations right next to the hotel which is super handy.  There is also a CVS next to it and restaurants across the street.  Also, the location is perfect.  The rooms are older, but clean and roomy.  I would highly recommend this hotel.;5
Me and my boyfriend spent 5 days in New York it was the most amazing but crazy experience, the hotel was Lovely also in a really good place, it’s about a 20 minute walk to Times Square, but you pass loads of shops and restaurants on the way and the subway is about 5 minutes walk, and there is a Macdonalds and a pizza shop across the road which was amazing! the staff were also friendly and very helpful, we were on the 27th floor so the hotel is quite high, the rooms are dated and nothing like the pictures, even being that high up you could still hear all the traffic and there was a constant draft in our room but luckily there was heating,  personally we thought it was a lot of money what we paid, for the rooms we got, also one of the days the maid came to clean the room we got;3
We very much liked how central the location of the hotel was, excellent for exploring the city. Very close to Penn station which was handy for us coming from Niagara and the subway was very close, ideal for getting to JFK Airport. The room was compact but very comfortable, we did have an issue with the room safe not working, we reported this and it was looked at but not fixed.  The tick tick diner adjoining the hotel was lovely and handy.  The staff were very helpful especially giving advice re subway directions. We were a bit disappointed at having to pay to leave luggage. We have travelled quite a bit and it’s the first time we have had to pay. I know it’s not vastly expensive but I’d rather have not paid $20.;4
The lobby and security are nice as you walk in.  The hotel is dated and needs some serious renovations.  I think some of the rooms have been upgraded, but since I had a dog with me (so thankful they accept pets) I was put in a room that was very old.  No coffee pot, dated, and extremely small.;3
The New Yorker's location across from Penn Station was excellent. The hotel was clean and bustling with tourist. However, the room size was so small I felt as if my husband and I had to move in tandem to get ready for our day. The room was clean enough, but sure could have used some maintenance. Staff was friendly.;4
The service was top notch here! I really enjoyed visiting New York City and having such a great location for a hotel! The customer service was acommodating and helpful!  I can't wait to visit in the future!;5
Just returned from a fab trip to the big Apple. Booked the New Yorker hotel through a travel agent. They seemed  to be impressed with this hotel. The foyer of this hotel is very grand and appears quite upmarket.  But that's where the grandness ends. On route to our room the carpets were scruffy fraying on the edges. Marble borders appeared grubby. Room was small but adequate. The bed was very comfy and pristine clean. The shower was a nightmare. Difficult to get it to the right temperature. Either scalding hot or freezing cold. Wasting valuable time trying to  get ready in the morning. Unable to shower one morning and had to make do with a top and tail wash.  Reported to reception and an engineer sent to fix the problem. This was no amends to me as I just wanted to be able to;3
This was our first trip to New York and we were delighted with the New Yorker as a place to stay. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful. The facilities are great with the 24 hour Tick Tock diner, 2 restaurants and bar. The location for first timers is spot on really close to the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Macy’s and Penn Station. Times Square is in easy walking distance and the location Midtown makes all other sites not too far away especially if you use the Subway.;5
The hotel looked amazing from outside and  inside the lobby, slightly disappointed by the size of the room and our view of other rooms in the hotel, but luckily we were only in there to sleep. Great location, across the road from Madison Square Garden, walking distance to the Empire State, Times Square, The Rockefeller Center and Hudson’s Yards.  Would deffo stay there again, room size didn’t put us off too much!;4
I was notified that the check in time was pushed back by one hour only once I arrived and tried to check in. The hotel refused to watch my luggage for free despite giving me my room late. Then I bought a late check out and the room cards deactivated at the original time. I had to go down to the lobby and wait in line to have the cards reactivated, preventing me from gathering my belongings and getting to the airport on time.;3
My son was staying at this hotel for school purposes.  Unfortunately, while he was away his room was having issues with the piping in the walls.  Being that it was a Sunday night and he was away I had to resolve this problem myself on the phone. Thank God that Neida in Customer Service picked up my call.  Neida went out of her way to help me find the correct department to resolve this issue with my son's room.  She went above and beyond to help me and without her help I would have been completely lost.  We should all be so lucky to have someone like Neida on the other end of the phone to help us out.  Thank you so much Neida. Ann Marie Baker;5
Great location, right across the street from Penn Station. The room was small but updated and clean.  It took the shower a REALLY long time to heat up, other then that no complaints about the room. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.;5
I stayed here with a friend & my daughter for her 9th Birthday.The staff service-from when we booked, to arriving, & checkout, was super friendly & on point. Great communication. I booked the cheapest possible option, figuring we wouldn't be spending much time at the hotel. I mentioned in my notes when booking that it was our first time visiting NYC & how excited we were. We were luckily & very kindly UPGRADED to an Empire State Building view room! Wow! Talk about making me the coolest mom ever haha! The view was breath taking, we had a completely clear view of the Empire State Building, we could see Madison Square Gardens as well. The room was very clean & a nice size. The location of this Hotel is ideal. Truly. For the price, which is conservative in comparison to other;5
Arrived at penn station from niagara, 5 min walk to hotel. 30 min walk to circle line pier, 45 min walk to one world Observatory, 10 mins to empire state. Rooms okay, safe in room, good hot water, bed comfy but compact room.;3
I spoke with Neida who was incredibly helpful when ensuring my mother and sister were taken care of in the hotel. Her responsiveness and attention to detail in dealing with my issues were second to none and she did a fantastic job and getting the whole thing sorted in a very short time.   5 Stars for Neida and thank you again!;4
We were impressed with the hotel and staff. Love the history and how beautiful kept the art deco decor is. Will recommend the hotel to others.  Our room was clean and well kept. Can definitely see the history in every aspect of this building. Love it.;5
I go to NYC 1-2x / year.  Have a few favorite hotels but my SIL was joining me and she liked this hotel so tried it.  Really liked the location.  Kind of iconic old hotel near Penn Station.  The room was small, but we are in NYC.  My SIL had great view, mine not so much but I never worry as I wasn't in the room except to sleep.  The lobby was always a great place to take a break and being so central to where we were going on this trip we could pop in / out during the day.  The staff were all very nice.  Good security as you had to show room key to get to elevator banks in the hotel.  Had a nice wine at the  bar and ate breakfast at Tic Toc diner connected to hotel.  Would definitely recommend this hotel if you are coming to NYC for some shows and the classic tourist  stops.;4
The Wilde Hotel in Ballybunnion is a small hotel facing the beach.It has been recently refurbished and it is a lovely and well designed hotel.The staff were very friendly and courteous.Parking is limited and a one way system is in place.Bedroom was small but comfortable and the breakfast was top class.Bar small but adequate.Ideal for a summer break.;3
The New Yorker hotel gets a full five stars from me! Although the hotel could do with a refurb in places, the staff more than make up for it and the security is great. On arrival we were checked into a very small room which overlooked a brick wall, I spoke with one of the staff,Driss, and he immediately was helpful and wanted to make it better. The next day we were upgraded to a bigger room with a view of the Empire State Building. The rooms are clean and every day we had fresh linen and towels. The security check your keys before you can go in the lift up to the rooms which is excellent. This hotel has charm and character and is right where you need to be location wise. You are ten minutes from Times Square and MSG is right across the road! The hotel doesn’t provide a kettle or;5
Close to empire state building, Madison Square garden and lots of other touristy locations. Bit dated rooms, bathroom was freezing because leaking window frames and bad breakfast possibilities. Mostly nice staff.;3
Stayed for 5 nights. Beautiful reception area and concierge staff go above and beyond to help. Rooms are immaculate with extremely comfortable beds. Tick Tok Diner was lovely. The staff in there are all so friendly. We witnessed some extremely rude people talking horrible to one member of staff, we was sitting at the counter and it really was more about the customer than the staff member, he took it well but there really is no need for such rudeness .. stay at home and be miserable. We had a lovely stay and will be returning next year. The lady who in charge of the left luggage is awesome, perfect customer service.;5
We visited the new Yorker for a week in October 2018. It ideally located in central Manhattan just a short walk from the Empire state building. The diner is ideal and good quality food for all the family. The hotel suite we stayed in was perfect in size (6 of us) but does a little dated and tired feel about it but was very clean. I would stay again;4
Everything was absolutely perfect, the staff was incredibly accommodating, and especially Driss at reception was so so nice to my parents, who felt like royalties because of the service received!  Room was fantastic (again, thanks Driss!) and every single of our needs was met. Location is great cause it’s 2 minutes away from the subway and from Penn Station, loads of restaurants around. Wonderful stay, highly recommended.;5
Only back from New York and i stayed in this hotel! When we went to check,no one told us we had to pay $200 to check in and we will get it back at the end and st the end we only got $104 back,we got the elevator up to the room when we got to your floor,the decorated was awful,it was not pained probably and felt like we were in 1 star hotel! We got to our room,it was really small and was not many places to put our stuff! Then the bathroom was so cold,we had to put a blanket under the door to keep the cold out of the room,the shower was not good,it was hard to keep it right and always went roasting,Dreaded having showers in the morning! Good things: the lobby was gorgeous,when you walked in,it was lovely decorated and furnished well,the Icon was brilliant,kept the room warm,the;1
When we arrived, the check in desk was very busy, waited around an hour. I got a free bottle of wine for celebrating my 21st. Checked into our room, I was so upset, it was so small, couldn’t fit two suitcases on the floor at once, it was freezing! I thought it’s only for sleeping in, were in New York, we won’t spend much time. Gets to the morning and the water from the bath and shower was green!!! Went down to the front desk asking to change rooms, and I’m so glad we did!! We paid a little extra upgrade fee, room 3907 was absolutely incredible, and the view was something else. 100% made my holiday so much better! The Tick Tock Diner next door is fabulous, amazing staff, food is incredible. Already booking for next year, with this hotel, and we will 100% pay for this exact room!;4
We stayed at the New Yorker Hotel from Sat 9 - Wed 14 March 2019.  We flew with United Airlines direct from Edinburgh to Newark.  Getting to the hotel was pretty easy - Air train from Newark (about $30) to Penn Station then a 5 min walk to the hotel.  Firstly the weather in March - sunny and chilly - not freezing but cold so a warm coat / jumper helps. Most days were bright and sunny although it did rain one day some maybe something waterproof just in case.  Next getting around - we walked a lot so comfy shoes a must.  We also bought a metro 7 day ticket which allows you to use the underground sytem unlimited. Great for taking you from one of Manhatten to the other. Stops also include Brooklyn and Bronx - basically Uptown (5th Av.) - Midtown - Downtown (World Trade / China;4
This hotel is in a brilliant location. It’s close to everything. However it’s very dated. The rooms are tiny. We stayed 3 people in one room. It had two queen size beds and we couldn’t even fit to open one suitcase on the floor. The diner is very pricey. There are better cheaper and tastier options just outside the door.;3
Me and My partner stayed at this hotel between 28th Feb to 4 March 2019, where do I start....  1) when we turned up to the hotel no one was helpful what so ever all stood round chatting while we stood waiting to check in and while we was stood waiting a customer checking was arguing with them due to their poor service.  2) me and my boyfriend ask for some help with getting some tickets printed off so we can a guy down stairs at the desk, when we ask if he could help he very rudely said I don't do that, go down stairs and do it. which at this point was our first 24 hours there so we didn't know we could do that.  3) about the second night in we wanted to go to a comedy club but was having problems booking the tickets so we asking the desk if they could point us in the right;1
Beautiful hotel and although the bedroom is quite compact, it’s clean, modern/traditional and the bed is incredibly comfortable and the bathroom has a shower over the bath, everything needed and the view we had looking directly at the Empire State Building was worth it’s weight in gold! I slept with the curtains open, watched the sun rise in the morning, absolutely breathtaking.;4
When visiting New York we find the New Yorker well located, especially with a 5 minute walk to Penn Station. Red Caps will actually bring your luggage to the hotel and hotel staff will take luggage to Lenn Station.  The rooms are fairly priced, modernized and have 5 star views of ESB and beyond  The 24 hour Tick Tock Restaurant and the Trattoria both provide outstand food and service at a fair price. Year after year the same staff is there.;5
Here are the negatives from my recent stay  Building is VERY old and therefore noisy, toilets and taps running all hours of the night sounding like a jet is next door  Walls were randomly vibrating very loud, the first time being 3am which petrified us. Pipes or air con I assume   Compulsory fee is a rip off, all sections should be optional and if you want to use the gym you pay for it. We HAD to pay for gym, calls (in 2019??), business suite and WiFi when we didn’t need any of them, $44 per day when Vodafone charge £5 per day on world traveller.....  I mentioned in the booking and via email that this trip was for my partners 30th but they did nothing special.  In room safe is tiny  Doors slam very hard and loud  I would recommend earplugs if staying here;2
Really enjoyed our stay at The New Yorker Hotel. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. We were originally on the 24th floor and the room was nice, but when the staff realised we were celebrating our 40th Wedding Anniversary they upgraded us to the 31st floor to a bigger room with a great view, and gave us a bottle of champagne. The hotel is in a good location so planning our sight seeing trips was easy.  The rooms were clean, and the Tick Tock Diner downstairs was very convenient to eat. The only down comment would be the concierge staff were not as friendly. Would stay at this hotel again.;4
Right I will start with the good things the security and tick tick diner staff where lovely the WiFi and great tv channels clean bed linen good water hot and pressure good heating in a   lovely Art Deco style with lots of history now the bad when we arrived we were given a room saying it was a upgrade because it had Empire State views the room was number 3719 we got on their was one small window damp walls mucky and smelt of damp so we went down stairs to a lady tutting well for tonight I’m not sure with a long pause she handed another key card to us with a smirky happy birthday we went back up to room 2301 it had its bad bits but looked better than the other with two bathrooms I have enclosed pictures it’s so weird you had to squeeze round the bed or stand on the bed to look;2
I stayed here with my daughter the beginning of February. Great welcome on arrival and we were also upgraded for free, for no reason at all which was a nice touch. I loved this place, it’s really nostalgic and reminded me of the king Kong film( we also had a view of the Empire State out of the window). The location too is amazing. Penn station is right outside, so is Maddison Square Garden, a short walk to the Empire State and Times Square. I also walked over to Central Park from there. Highly recommended.;4
We stayed for 4 nights in a suite on 40th floor (4005). The views were absolutely amazing. The bedroom windows views were onto the Empire State Building one way and the financial centre/downtown/ world trade centre the other way. For 4 days we loved every sunset and sunrise. The location is top!  The Trattoria in the hotel is handy, friendly service, good choice of food and drink and nice atmosphere. The gym was great too, everything you need in a hotel gym. There was an extra charge for wifi and ours didnt work for the first three days due to some network issues so the reception kindly cancelled the extra charge from our final bill. The suite itself was spacious but furniture slightly dated and tattered. For an extra $5 per luggage the hotel stores it for you while you check;4
Very small room as expected. I had to hire a small fridge to store my medication. Housekeeping very efficient and room was spotless. Never tried the in house diner. The best thing about the hotel was the location next to the subway station. My wife cannot walk far so we used the subway a lot to get around on our first trip to New York. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Great place to celebrate our Golden wedding.;4
Fantastic boutique hotel very central to Macey’s Times Square and penn station.  We where there just prior to Thanksgiving leaving the morning of thanksgiving.  Hotel is fantastic and NYC as always a pleasure to visit;5
Good price, but beware hidden charges. 4 night stay incites a further $129 in facility fees, then you have to pay $5 dollars for your luggage to be looked after...so what’s the facility fee for exactly?? Room are small but clean. The saving grace for me was John at the Concierge desk, an absolute diamond, couldn’t do enough for me...here in the city alone for work, so kind and helpful! Good location, right by MSG & Penn Station so the whole of New York is very accessible! Must visits Tavola Italian on 9th & Carraghers Bar for all you sports fans! Enjoy NYC it really doesn’t sleep!!;4
We stayed here for 10 days.  I was disappointed at the lack of facilities available for guests.  No coffee/tea facilities, (they wanted $25 per day for a drip filter 😠) no kettle,  no laundry service,  it blew out our food budget tremendously as we couldn't prepare anything in our room.  Disappointed as a Wyndham Guest who is used to superior standards across the Wyndham spectrum.  I will say the location is good and we had a good view of the Empire State Building.  Not somewhere I would stay again.  Run down.;3
Absolute amazing time staying at the new Yorker from the easy professional check in from miguel who even upgraded us to 33rd floor with a fantastic view of empire state building and Madison square garden. Staff all friendly and helpful lady in tick tick restaurant advised us were to go sure seeing etc and what subway to take.  A walk away from Penn station and a 5 minute walk to port authority.  Close to time square . I had a fab stay and will definitely be returning to stay at this great hotel.;4
We stayed for 2 nights at the New Yorker.  Room was super clean. A bit tight for 4 adults but only in room to sleep so it was fine.  Had requested high floor with a view and this was given to us.  Staff very nice.  Expect the bathroom to be small but has all the necessities.  Parking right across the street - very practical and discount when staying at the New Yorker.  We definitely recommend.  Great location - right across MSG.;4
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, especially when there are so many great choices available for accommodations in NYC. We stayed here for 6 days and it felt like an eternity. The first room we were placed in was extremely musty and the decor was very dated. I felt as though we had been placed in a room that hadn't been used in a while or something... There was a thin layer of grime on the bathroom floor that made me wish I had brought a pair of shower shoes with me. We eventually asked to be placed in a different room, and the room they moved us to was probably half the size of our original room, but I will say that it wasn't as dusty. The decor in general throughout the hotel needs to be redone, I'm guessing it's all probably 20 years old or something. The only;2
Stayed at The New Yorker for my first visit to NYC to see a concert at Madison Square Gardens.  Great property and really affordable given its location to everything I wanted to do.  Make sure you check out the museum in the basement.  I wandered across it by accident, the history of this building is fascinating.;5
We stayed for 5 nights and were very pleased with the room. It was simple but clean. As a visit to New York for us meant being out for most of the day this room was more than adequate. The bed was comfy. Check in and out went smoothly. The location is perfect. Lots within walking distance and a subway station right outside.;5
When I go to NYC I always stay at the New Yorker because of its location and value.  The rooms are always clean and the views amazing.  The staff is always attentive to your needs.  We will be back in a few weeks.;5
Used my Wyndham points for two nights and purchased two more nights. Notified front desk at checkin and had a seamless transition between to two reservations, keeping the same room.   We found our room in excellent condition. Standard room was a bit small but not enough to disappoint since little time was spent in it.   New Yorker is perfectly positioned for the major sight seeing locations with the Empire State Building two blocks away and Madison Square Gardens across the street.   We look forward to another stay sometime in the future.;4
Nice place to stay and close to the Madison square gardens and many other fun places to visit. Penn station is right across the street and that’s very convenient. Clean rooms and nice choices for food and drink at the hotel. The staff were all nice and helpful.;5
The location is perfect for shopping and across the street from Madison Square Gardens! Our suite was very clean, comfortable and quite spacious. We all enjoyed the lovely lounge and the Tic Tock for anytime dinning was superb! The staff were super friendly and very accommodating. We checked in a few hours early and planned to check our bags as we have done for many years at hotels all over the city and were very disappointed to be charged $5 for each bag. Never had this been an issue until now but someone was nice enough to tell us we could pay extra for an early check in that was must less expensive as checking all of our bags! We had a wonderful experience and are looking forward to our next stay at The New Yorker a Wyndham Hotel!;5
I’ll start by saying I found absolutely nothing wrong with my stay.   Its an older hotel, with great location and a good value.   Its an older property, Things are kept up but you can see the age on them.   Its clean but weathered.   There’s nothing fancy about this place.;4
It’s only my first night here and I’m already disappointed. Firstly the charge of $31 per day just to use their facilities. To have coffee/tea facility in your room there is an extra charge! On top of that the room is very outdated. The bathroom is old and rusty. Beds are not comfortable at all. The only upside is the location and the view of the Empire State Building.  The hotel desperately needs renovating.  Will definitely  not be choosing this hotel next time I visit NYC;2
Hotel in excellent location. Service was great, however the hotel is old and is showing its age. I had the double suite and it was smaller than the pictures online show. I enjoyed my stay at Wyndham overall but next time I might choose a newer hotel with more room.;4
I am booked on a trip to NYC which will stay at the New Yorker hotel from May 5-12. I want to book a room for May 4. I've made three calls to the hotel and spoken with five different people, none of whom can accommodate this simple request. Based on this response, I would never stay here except that in this case I have no choice. Complete incompetence.;1
I stayed her for a week with my mother visiting relatives, and we wanted to do some site seeing. Unfortunately during our visit the hotel was surrounding by scaffolding that had been in place for a very long time, so that took at little getting used to. Its a very classy hotel. The rooms, foyer, restaurant are all very nice but lack atmosphere. There is diner next door for breakfast and such, and its busy and bustling. The location is fabulous right across from Penn Station for easy access to transport.  Its a nice hotel , I couldnt fault it;4
On arriving at the New Yorker Hotel my initial thoughts was WOW ... check in was quick staff friendly .. we was on floor 22 in a room with no view and very drafty windows ... I had to put 3 pillows at the bottom of the window to stop the draft . The rooms decor was dated but clean the cleaners do a good job.  Tick tock diner was good n staff friendly not cheap to dine but then no where in NYC is cheap to eat . same as the  Italian with in the hotel.  The hotel is central and a good base to stay in the city. Wld I recommend this hotel  ... yes the only gripe was the windows .. We booked with booking.com n paid for the hidden charges as a whole price and was cheaper so we wasn't stung with hidden add ons.;3
From the moment we arrived check in smooth and efficient, the hotel is old charm from top to bottom. Staff very helpful and rooms very comfortable. Walking around New York is easy from the perfect location and will stay here again if I return. First class...;5
"This is my favorite NY hotel; location, atmosphere, friendly staff, everything. Sure, it's not a luxury hotel but that's really not the point. But this time I was disappointed; I took my 12-year old son (first time in NY) and requested and paid for a room with a view of the city. We got tucked in a room overlooking the backyard... I alerted the staff twice but got no response. Disappointing.  EDIT: Management reached out to me afterwards and provided an explanation plus a refund. Good customer care.";5
This was our first time in New York and straight away found the staff very helpful. The Hotel itself is ideally situated for Madison square gardens and the empire state building, there's lots of staff around the lobby more than willing to help you. The rooms are clean and reasonably priced. There are two resturants and bars and a diner, we ate in all three and found the food great, and the bars where also good, and reasonable. I would definitely recommend staying here as you have everything you want.;5
It was art deco but not modern, nothing was kept up with the diner, and italian restaurant are good just not good customer service. I asked for a cot with pillows and a blanket and was denied . So offensive;2
I have stayed in the New Yorker each time I've come to the city for business and have found the staff to be friendly and accommodating and the room to be consistent. The price is reasonable for the location. I will continue to use them every time I travel to NYC.;5
The overall experience was good. Our room wasn’t ready when we arrived at 6pm!! 4 hours after our original check in time. They resolved the problem by upgrading our room to a larger one (but also downgrading our view). We quickly dropped our bags off and left to a dinner reservation. When we arrived we noticed a pubic hair on the toilet!! I went downstairs to ask for something to disinfect the toilet and the front desk rudely responded “we don’t have that on hand in the reception area.” I asked nicely that I could return after coffee at the Tick Tock diner and he said he would send housekeeping. They never showed up, if they did they didn’t leave a note. We just ended up picking some Clorox wipes up from CVS and doing it ourselves. Other than that, everyone was super friendly;4
"I booked two rooms for one night at ""The New Yorker"" using a trip advisor link. One room for my wife and I and one room for our friends from Zambia who we were taking into NYC to see a play and do some sightseeing. I chose the New Yorker for three reasons: 1. Price; 2. Location; and 3. the advertised fact that the hotel had a bar/lounge on one of the upper floors with a great view.  What a rip off. I was quoted with my triple AAA discount a rate of $359.16 for both rooms with free wifi. The actual cost we paid was $597.04. In addition to the NY sales tax and NY city hotel tax which I expected there was an occupancy tax, a NYC hotel unit fee, a mandatory $29 Facility fee ( so you could have the ""FREE"" wifi), a Non-Room Tax NY state sales tax fee,  and a Non-Room Tax NYC sales";1
Location of Hotel was convenient to many attractions in the city and very close to the subways.   Rooms were clean and check in and check out were fast and easy.  Hotel has a doorman and security person located at the elevators checking for hotel keys;5
The New Yorker was well situated for accessing the Broadway shows. Eighth Ave. was well lighted and busy with people so I felt safe walking back from evening performances. The room was a little smaller, but very clean and adequately furnished. I did hear some street noises on the 8ith floor. It was nice to have security checking to make sure guests belonged before they let people enter the elevators. The Tick Tock restaurant onsite was open 24/7 for a quick meal. I will certainly consider the New Yorker on a future trip to NYC.;5
This hotel is so beautiful and I was upgraded to a corner room with a straight view of the Empire State Building. The room was great, my whole experience and every single person I came in contact with was very friendly. I will definitely stay here again;5
From the moment we stepped off of the subway and approached the front door, we had nothing but a phenomenal experience. All of the staff is super friendly and awaiting your every need. The location was perfect and close to everything. The view was amazing. The restaurants are all awesome as well. I highly recommend staying here for business or pleasure. This was my first time in NYC and was such a great experience.   ***** Picture is view from our room.;5
A great stay in a lovely hotel. We paid a little extra for an Empire State View and wasn't disappointed. You really won't be in the room much but when you was it was clean, tidy and quiet.   The diner is great and the lobby Coffee shop also came in handy and was better than having the coffee making facilities in the room.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it;5
Booked in yesterday for a 5 day break to New York. Amazing customer service from Linda on the reception desk (Monday 12.02.19), she was so welcoming and allowed us to see a variety of rooms before deciding which one we'd chose. We opted for room 384 which is a corner room with amazing views. One size to the Empire State and from the other side Madison Square Garden. Great lobby - art deco and really cool. Looking forward to five days of sight seeing and enjoy the New York hospitality. Started off great with exceptional customer care from Linda.;4
What a find. Right next to Penn station. Convenient to the Lincoln tunnel. Very affordable. Everything you need is in the building or nearby.Staff is very professional. Valet parking is very swift and convenient. Stayed twice over a two week period. This is my new firstchoice in NYC.;4
I just got home after another pleasant stay in The New Yorker. The security staff diligently provides 24 hour protection to guests, visually confirming every valid room key at the elevator. This makes me feel safe and valued as a customer. I’ve stayed many places in New York, some more expensive and some less - but I won’t stay anywhere else for the quality, comfort, safety, and value of The New Yorker. They meet or exceed the mark on every level. We also enjoy the convenient, 24 hour Tick Tock diner. And did I mention the views??;5
Since The New Yorker has become part of the Wyndham family I have stayed 4 or 5 times. Love that Wyndham has kept much of the classic art deco architecture in the hotel. Stepping into the lobby is like stepping back in time to the elegance of an earlier era! The hotel is conveniently located to Penn Station (NY) - right across the street! Madison Square Garden is also just across 8th Ave. Had tickets for Elton John's Farewell Concert at MSG last Thursday. How great to be able to just walk across the street to the concert! Have stayed in number of different room configurations. All have been clean and comfortable! (I do wish a coffee maker would be part of the amenities, though!) Tick Tock Diner off the lobby has great breakfasts! Also many other restaurants within easy walking.;5
Stayed here a few times now. Very central for train and bus into the city. Shopping nearby great.  Few minutes walk to Macys and other good shops. Lots of places for eating in and out. Easy walk to the Highline getting away from the madness lol. The rooms ive had a couple of times have over looked 34th street.  Just ask at the desk and they should help if they can. The hotel has its own car service which i used once and it was very good. The TikTok Diner which is on the side of the hotel is very good. Easy for taking you food back to your room. Would stay here again but i keep getting better prices for other hotels.;4
We have just come back from a 4 night trip to New York staying at the Wyndham Newyorker hotel midtown.Check in was pretty quick we where put on the 36th floor which gave us a great view .The room was ok but small there were a few unclean dusty parts but the bed was clean and comfortable. The wifi was very good and you also had use of the gym and business centre which did cost us $94 for the 4 nights.I would stop there again location was good but I would upgrade from a standard room to something a bit better.;4
We arrived early at the hotel and was greeted by Afora who was very nice and informed me that our room had been upgraded which was very much appreciated. I was then told it would be 5 dollars per bag to leave them until check in or I could check in early for an additional $50 which was nearly as cheap which I did. The room 3509 was a good size, had views of the Hudson river, Maddison square garden and was spotlessly clean and cleaned everyday although like the rest of the hotel was a bit tired and could do with some TLC. We had booked for 4 nights b&b and was given vouchers for a continental breakfast in the Ticktock diner. After ordering our breakfast it was brought to our table by the waiter who barely even spoke to us. We tried again the following morning and this time after;3
Other than the location close to Madison Square Garden this hotel fall far short of any reasonable expectations. The property is beyond tired - it’s not being maintained. In my room there was water damage on the ceiling, cracks in the walls, mismatched tiles in the bathroom floor, mold in the shower and the tv didn’t work. I called about the tv and no one ever came. Maybe there’s hope - there’s a surprise $29 facility fee tacked onto the bill, as part of the incidentals charged to the room. Maybe the hotel operator is using that as a funding source for the badly required renovations. Until that’s completed I’m going to stay away.;2
We stayed for 3 nights in February as part of our honeymoon. The hotel is fantastically located close to Times Square. We were able to walk to the majority of the things we wanted to see (Times Sq, Macy's, Central Park, Broadway etc.) and we were able to easily get the subway to the 9/11 memorial and statue of liberty. The service was good from all at the hotel, and we also enjoyed breakfast in the Tick Tock diner, and a cocktail in the vault. Our room was on the 20th floor and although in was small, it provided all that we needed and was always very clean. We had a problem with a blocked toilet and it was sorted very quickly.  Overall a lovely stay for our first time in NY.;4
The Hotel is located right by Madison square gardens and within walking distance to Times Square. The rooms are extremely small, the shower is like being jet washed but it’s clean. The staff are really friendly and helpful, even when most of the guests were complaining of the strong smell of weed lingering in the rooms. When you check- out and still have some time to explore the city then it’s $5 per bag for the hotel to hold them. We stayed for 5 nights and the room tax was $120 which is expensive compared to other hotels.  Checking in was easy, make sure you have ID and the credit card you paid with as the hotel take a security payment of over $200 which you get back at the end and can also use some of that money to pay for the room tax.   PROS- good location, friendly staff;3
I came for two nites on a working holiday.  Very nice hotel and bar. Room very spacious and alot of  channels on t.v as you would expect.  Breakfast ok and coffee was really good  Would stay here again on my next visit.;4
Great location, tiny rooms as expected in NYC. We were on the 20th floor and were upgraded for my boyfriends birthday to a view of the Empire State from our room. Very noisy from noise outside and rooms are so close could her next doors conversation. Lovely surprise for his birthday from the hotel bottle of Prosecco and chocolates and a card. We arrived at 6.30 in morning and couldn’t check in until 4 but paid 50 dollars to check in and they found us our upgraded room straight away. Only thing which really annoyed me hence 1 star less is we checked out at 12 our flight not until 7.30 in the evening and they charge you for storing your luggage 5 dollars per item some may think nothing of that. But when you’ve just stayed with them for 6 nights I think that’s a joke!;4
We have been here for 4 nights, it was not really in our expectation. The Location is good, few minutes by walk from Time Square, empire State building and the subway station is literally next to the door entrance. The room forniture is a bit old, we were in 4 in a room with 2 double beds, the sink in the toilet was really noisy, we could't use it during the night. When we checked out we asked to leave the luggages and they asked us 5$ for each luggage... this is incredible as it supposed to be a service from the Hotel... It needs improvements because it is a really shame for the location!!!!;3
good hotel, central location, rooms reasonably clean, comfortable beds, would stay again Close, walking distance  to everywhere, quite rooms, enjoyed my stay........... Nice view from the window , you can see anew York City;3
As others have mentioned, this hotel is in an ideal mid town location, but we found our room to be disappointingly small and in need of updating - 'tired' being an apt description. We arrived late evening after a flight delay and the receptionist made a show of searching on his computer to find us a good sized room. He gave us the impression that he'd found one, but when we got up there it turned out to be one of the smallest double rooms we've stayed in (at the very end of a corridor on the 31st floor). Only one seat (the desk chair) and no room to swing the proverbial cat. We were by then too tired to argue, but quite disappointed. One morning we also had the unpleasant experience of brown water coming through the bathroom taps, which left the towels and flannels stained. When;3
We booked the New Yorker based on the location that it had, right on the 8th Avenue, next to Madison Square Garden. Perfect location and great area to be in. The Front Desk team was great and very helpful, same as the Concierge, that helped us with maps and booking an airport shuttle. We paid for a room with a view and we got one, but that is where the fun began. Corridors look a bit shabby, doors are still the old ones and just painted on top in a very cheap way. Room is extremely small, while in the pictures on the website it looked at least to say huge, so don't be deceived. The A/C was blowing right above the bed which made both me and my girlfriend extremely sick. It was extremely cold in the room so you had to keep the A/C on heating on. The windows were not taken care of;3
Recently stayed here on a five night trip with my husband as a birthday treat. Thanks to Jose for upgrading us to a suite with amazing views.  Great location for exploring NYC and that’s exactly what we done. I would recommend this hotel as nothing was too much bother.;4
"Came to this hotel for my stay in NYC this week, as we were going to see Elton John at Madison Square Garden on March 6th.  Couldn't ask for this hotel to be more perfectly located, as we came in on the train from New Jersey, and Penn Station is a very short walk away.  Was also very convenient to have a short walk back to the hotel after the concert, as it let out around 11 PM.  There was a variety of options for food in the immediate area, including the 24-hr Tick Tock Diner, which the hotel has an entry door to right from the lobby.  We got room 2858 (28th floor) and had an incredible city view!  My ONLY complaint is that it's very hard to regulate the temperature of the shower water; the only temperature of the water from our shower was incredibly hot.  That's honestly my";5
This hotel is in a superb location for accessing all part of NYC.  However, I was very disappointed at how tired the rooms were. There were 4 of us and it was a special occasion so I booked We booked a 2 Double Beds New Yorker View Suite and given the price I had high expectations. What a disappointment, it was very very worn and felt very grubby. We all felt so flat that I went to reception to see about moving room. They managed to move us to a 2 Double Beds, Executive Room which was supposedly newly renovated.  It was a major improvement in terms of how it looked and felt but it was a quarter of the size of the suite and there is no way it had seen any renovations newly! Having said all this, bearing in mind you will probably not be spending much time in your room other than;3
This hotel is in a great position for site seeing. The hotel is very clean and our room was nice and big, we had a double double room. It is ready for a refurb but having said that is does have that old world charm. If you are reasonably fit you can walk to most attractions or the subway is only a 2min walk away. I would defiantly go tooth's Hotel again if I was going to New York.;4
Our room was great! Beds were very comfortable & the staff was friendly. It is an awesome location... very close to Madison Square Garden (where we were seeing a concert that night) & Macy’s... and walking distance to Times Square... close to Penn Station & the subway. I’m so glad we stayed there & would definitely stay there again! :);4
We found the New Yorker served its purpose.  The rooms are small but they are clean which is the main thing.  The hotel is  a bit dated and could do with a spruce up.  You must try the diner attached.  The breakfasts are great;4
The hotel is centrally located in Midtown with convenient access to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. The old world charm is good and the staff are very friendly. It is perfect for short stays in new York.;4
Wow! Just returned from a wonderful stay at The New Yorker, Wyndham with my sister and my daughters.  As a travel writer, I have travelled extensively, and I must say this hotel was top notch.  The service was wonderful, the view stunning, the location perfect.  Special mention to Ms. Megan Blackburn, Guest Services manager, who went above and beyond to make this stay a truly magical one for my three daughters. Highly recommend!;5
We had an executive view double room.  We were told when we booked that these rooms had undergone a complete renovation.  That was very questionable.  The shower leaked all over the floor.  We put towels down to soak up the water.  The sink was so small you couldn't turn the faucet on more than 1/4 or the water ran over the sides of the sink. Apparently the shower was also leaking into the room beneath us also because we were told we had to move rooms because of a mechanical problem.  What a pain to have to pack, move, unpack again. At least they upgraded us to a suite with a view.  We liked this room until 5am the following morning when we were awakened by water hammer noise coming from the room above us.  It sounded like a jet engine in the room! The day we checked out there;2
Great hotel!! Literally opposite Penn Station, can see it across the street if you come out at 8th Avenue.  Check in swift and and friendly, lobby really nice, Art Deco with a really cool vibe.  Our room was on the 36th floor, brilliant view of Madison Square Garden, and the Statue of Liberty in the distance.  Yes, the room was small, but it was perfectly adequate, bathroom was fine, clean and tidy, plenty of towels and complimentary toiletries provided.  Heating system on wall that worked throughout our stay, shower was powerful.  WiFi strong in our room and in public areas.  Hotel was quiet and we had no disturbance from the street being so high up.  Location ideal, walking distance to Empire State Building, Macy’s, Times Square and the subway is just across the street for;5
This was my first time visiting New York along with 1 other friend and this hotel and hospitality was incredibly disappointing. Months before arriving, we had requested two twin beds, but when we arrived in reception, we were informed that if we wanted twin beds it would cost $20 extra per night.   We knew the queen bed would not be big enough for two adults with a lot of luggage, so we agreed. When we go to the room we were incredibly disappointed. The room was very, dated and was also the smallest twin room I have ever seen (I appreciate that the rooms in a city hotel won't be as big as other places). The bathroom was very dirty, the tub was peeling, shower curtain was impractical- everything in that bathroom was a big NO. The view was of the back of a brick building. No view;2
The new Yorker is in a great location right next to Penn station, making going to and from JFK airport very easy via subway or LIRR. It is also well placed for the tourist sights and of course all the great shopping. We ha a lovely double room on the 24th floor with twin double beds which were so comfortable, but there is quite a lot of street noise, but hey it’s New York, if you want quiet visit somewhere else😁 The hotel and rooms may be old but are kept very clean and tidy, and this hotel is very busy at all hours. Just remember that check in is at 4pm, so all early UK flights will have to wait for their rooms but you can put your cases in the baggage room for $5 each. Already looking at returning next year👍 The only bad part is the lack of tea making facilities in the rooms.;5
Stayed here for three nights for a business trip. Positives: great location, WiFi included in room rate, room was kept clean and all the hotel staff I dealt with were very pleasant.  Negatives: Typical NYC tiny rooms (barely room to get around the bed and that’s it), old bathroom and fixtures, drafty windows, and noisy (could hear showers turning on in other rooms, and colleagues on other floors heard construction outside all night long). I would opt for another hotel next time.;3
The property is self contained.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are available 7 days a week and 24 /7 for the Tick Tock Diner.   Fitness and Business Centers round out the offerings.  The Lobby is spacious and comfortable for meeting friends and family.  There is lots to do outside the building as well.  A very good place to stay near where you want to be in NYC.;5
Had a wonderful 4 nights here   From the front desk at check in to the wonderful staff I could not fault. The room was s little small when we first opened the door but I had expecting that. Got use to it. Had all we wanted. I never sleep in a strange bed on the first night but managed a good nights sleep on the 1st night.  Bathroom was clean. Nice little cloakroom with safe. The Tick Tock restaurant was very good. Reasonably priced and good friendly staff.  It's an Art Deco Style hotel and I loved it. Furniture, desks and waiting reception was beautiful.  Could not day a bad word.;5
Superbly located next to Maddison square garden and just 5 mins walk from Times Square the Newyorker is a decent enough hotel.  The initial reception area is very nice and all the staff are friendly. The restaurant was fantastic and as mentioned the location is absolutely superb to get to all the tourist areas of New York.  The room was basic but it’s just a place to sleep. The biggest issue is the noise from the road below. Our windows were not the best and all you could hear were beeping cars and emergency services. I guess you are so tired you sleep through it but I wouldn’t want to listen to it for more than a few nights (I am a light sleeper)  All in all a decent place for a long weekend stay;4
We stayed here for a friends special birthday and the room had a great view of the Empire State Building. Unfortunately, the room was tiny for a double double room, handles on all drawers were hanging off, and the bathroom was VERY tired. There we're no coffee making facilities in the room or a refrigerator, and when we queried this we were told we could have them for an additional charge of $50 plus tax per night! This would have added over $200 to our stay.... the room was also that small, there was nowhere to put them, even though we were told this was a large room by a very rude receptionist.  Its a good job we didn't spend much time in the room.  Also had noisy pipe work at 4am in the morning and on the last night very rude noisy neighbours, who had to have three visits;3
Travelled with a group of friends. There was some confusion with our booking possibly due to our travel agent. The reception team were happy to assist. The hotel did seem to struggle with the volume of people queuing for reception and some requests took longer than expected to action.   The rooms were clean and comfortable. The decor is dated however and could do with some modernisation especially in the bathrooms.   The location was perfect considering we went to a a couple of sporting events at MSG.   During our stay there was a dog event happening at MSG. There were a large number of guests with dogs staying. As a result the lobby stunk pretty bad of dog.   A couple of the security guys in front of the lifts could also do with cheering up and take their jobs a little too;3
Would recommend this hotel as it's quite central to many attractions.  Room we stayed in was nice and had two bathrooms!  Tick tock restaurant is next door and reasonably priced for food. Staff are pleasant and helpful.  Empire State Building is only a 10 minute walk away and time square just a little further.;4
We were there for the first time and we had a desk agent named Mohammed. He was super nice to us and gave us an enormous room. Everything was perfect. That was five years ago! And every time we go to New York, we always stay at the New Yorker. We take the train down from Rensselaer and we go right into Penn Station. The hotel is right across the street! Also, it's only a couple of blocks from Macy's. Perfect! We stayed there again in December of 2018 and we really liked the remodeled bar.;5
Hotel was clean and comfortable,  staff were very helpful. Especially when I left an item in the safe and had to have it posted to me quickly to our next hotel on our trip 😳  The only downside was there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Other than that would definitely recommend and would stay again.;4
I just recently stayed again at the NewYorker.  For the most part I love this hotel.  I always prefer an older hotel that has aged with character over time.  Thats the NewYorker.  Its probably just about a hundred years old and while updated, it still shows signs of the past.  Its old sign is visible in the NYC skyline as you enter the city but when you go into the lobby you see a classy interior that shimmers and shines.  The main elevator area has 12 elevators with some for the first 20 floors and others for the rest.  There's never a long wait for the elevator. This area is always monitored by staff checking that you have a room key - a nice touch of security.    The lobby is enormous and has tables with electrical outlets - lots of comfortable seats and couches around coffee;4
Our first time to New York staying in the New Yorker and certainly won't be our last. Perfect central location, right next to Penn Station, Port Authority and short walk from Times Square. An old, established, iconic New York Hotel, room very comfortable and clean, friendly and helpful staff throughout, nothing too much trouble. Special thanks to Muhammad for his assistance during our stay. Looking forward to our future visit.;5
The staff was very friendly. The location was perfect, just across from Penn Station/MSG. The rooms were dated and tiny, but clean. The walls were thin and you could hear the people around you. It was perfectly fine for my fiancé and I who were just staying for a night after the Rangers game.;3
Staff was very nice & helpful, especially the man at the desk when we checked in very late. Offered us late check out which was most appreciated. Hotel room was clean, comfortable & very convenient to Penn Station & Empire State Building. Bathroom a little dated - cracked tiles in floor.;4
there is a charge for early check in, when checked out charge for holding your suitcases prior to leaving the hotel. no tea and coffee facilities, cheaper to buy a kettle and some cups, ( which we did ) , booked a standard room with queen bed, assuming my friend and I had a bed each, no we had to share a bed, could have been a problem, could have up graded but should have been told of this before hand. Resort fee gives you free usage of the telephone, very worthwhile, can make international calls etc also use of wi fi and computer room. Lovely art deco hotel though, clean and plenty of hot water, staff very helpful. John Concierge very helpful, also Naomi our cleaner nothing too much trouble for either of them. Tick Tock diner adjoined found this expensive, around the corner;4
We stayed for 5 nights during half term. Upon arrival check in was very smooth and we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite with amazing views of the Empire State Building. I found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful and in particular I am very gtrateful to a member of the night staff . On our first evening my son was very afraid of being on the 40th floor and had panic attacks and was ill during the night. I went to reception at 3.30am ( it was the only way I could calm him down) and explained our circumstances and the gentleman was so supportive of my son and agreed to change our room the next day.  The following morning my son had calmed and I took him to reception to advise that he was going to try and stay in the room. He’s only 11 but the staff;4
We stayed in the New Yorker for 5 nights in February. After reading some reviews we were not sure what to expect.   We were not disappointed.  From a speedy early check in (arrived an hour early) to having our room upgraded on arrival we were off to a great start. We were on 35th floor with a superb view of the Empire State and Madison square garden.  We had a double double room and yes it was compact with small bathroom but was clean and comfy and very manageable.   (Slept fantastic all nights we were there ).  Situated beside tic toc diner which is fantastic for breakfast and hotel is only  5 min from maceys and penn station.  Hotel staff all very friendly and it was nice to have security check everyone before they headed for lifts.   Felt very safe.  It was nice to sit in the;5
"Like an older posh London hotel that needs a licked of paint. Greeted by a concierge in full frock coat, a lobby out of an old film, with ultra modern efficient staff. The email I sent prior to arrival was acknowledged and noted:""Happy 21st birthday "" greetings for my daughter who was then treated as the lead guest. View from the room was spectacular overlooking the Empire State and Chrysler Buildingso which are breathtaking when little up at night. Shower over sunken bath. Vending and ice machines on many floors with a 24hr diner downstairs and you want for nothing.  Late checkouts available.  International phone calls and fitness centre included in room tax. So welcoming I'd happily return.";5
The hotel itself was very nice, a short walk away from Times Square. It was clean and tidy but our room was tiny. The concierge was rude and threw our bags in the taxi which meant i knocked a point off, would have been a 4. Would recommend, even though the room was tiny we wasn’t in there that much;3
My stay at The New Yorker  for 4 nights were awesome, the most important amenities where the security to enter your room, the clean rooms, restaurants  and bell services. I will be returning to this establishment on next year.;5
Stayed at the hotel for my 3rd visit to New York, found the hotel's location ideal, much better than the previous ones I'd stayed in which were all closer to central park. Can't be more than a 10 minute walk to the Empire State Building, multiple subway options and a short walk to times square. My room had great views of the empire state building, with two good sized, comfy beds, what more can you ask for when you're only in the room to sleep. The diner attached to the hotel, Tick Tock diner, was lovely, great breakfast options and so convenient for hotel guests. The only negative I have for the hotel is when I entered my room the bathroom wasn't cleaned very well, there was a towel which had a big lump of hair attached to it and the plug in the bath was caked in hairs, not very;4
Very central and across from madison square gardens, tic tic dinner which has a entrance from lobby was great for breakfast, and staff very warm and friendly. Room we were in was small but was ok , very retro but all mod cons were there.;3
The hotel is in a great location, to the right is Penn Station, over the road are subway lines and about a 15 minute walk to the left up 8th and across 42nd is Times Square. It had the advantage of 3 on site restaurants in the building offering diner style to fine dining. Just along 34th is the Empire State Building, Macy’s and Madison Square Garden.;4
Stayed here for 3 nights and although the room was small, it was ok for the time we spent in there. A coffee maker would have been beneficial. Its location was great for exploring New York, walking distance to lots of great places.;4
Arrived on 17th Feb, 2 rooms for 4 people, to be told that they did not have a room for me and my daughter! After a long flight, I was so worried, they said travel bag had cancelled 1 of the rooms! They decided to put me and my daughter in a suite, with a fabulous view of the Empire State Building, floor 39.  Went down to reception the next day and they said it had been sorted.  I had contacted travel bag in the meantime and they confirmed they had not cancelled our room, it was the hotels error! On a plus side we got to stay in the suite for 5 nights free of charge, which we appreciated.  I am going back to this hotel in October, booked through Expedia this time, but am really concerned this could happen again!!! The hotel was really well located and the suite was lovely, hotel;3
Stayed here for 5 nights last month. Great hotel with very helpful staff. Bedroom was on the small side but very comfortable and clean. Only in it to sleep anyway. Great location with subways and trains close by to go anywhere. The diner ticktock was excellent too. Can't wait to return. Highly recommended;5
The New Yorker is probably the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Every interaction with staff was great, particularly the wonderful lady who checked us in and made every endeavour to make our special trip even more special. Even the people that checked our room keys for security put smiles on our faces every time we walked in or out!  The hotel is so iconic and all the Art Deco features are beautiful. The view made waking up in the morning an absolute dream, and the bed was so comfy that it was the one thing to stop me wanting to jump out in excitement! Every day, the room was cleaned to a faultless standard.   Thanks to all the wonderful staff, and a great hotel, for a perfect stay!;5
Arrived from England having already been informed by my brother in law who had stayed at the Wyndham that I might find the room not that big, but that it had not dampened his time at the hotel. He had pointed out that it was more than adequate for his stay. When booking in we were told that our room was small but if we weren't happy we could let them know the following morning as the hotel was full on the evening we arrived. We had space to move around and space for our possessions so we stayed put. I eagerly looked out of our window as my brother in law had a view of the Empire State. No such luck - ours was a room opposite, looking onto ours. We had heard that noise from other rooms was a problem, though apart from the first night when we heard a TV on too loud we heard;5
On arrival we were greeted by two lovely ladies who offered us an upgrade to larger rooms with two double beds, TV, tea & coffee making machine, two wardrobes, good bathroom, great shower & bathrobes & hairdryer. There were 6 ladies in our party so good facilities for two sharing. Beds were extremely comfortable. There is a lovely Diner just off reception, brilliant for breakfast though is open 24 hours & food is very good. Very good restaurant on opposite side of reception, amazing fillet steak, plus a third restaurant downstairs equally as good, where there is a quirky cocktail bar. Fab location close to Penn Station, Madison Square Gardens, Empire State Building & Maceys with a Macdonalds opposite the hotel too!  A short walk to bus station where we caught a bus to the;5
Fabulous hotel in the heart of Manhattan.. great for getting around New York with everything so close.. the hotel is great lovely clean rooms .. staff sometimes seem a little abrupt but I think that’s a New York thing .. overall recommend to all;5
We came to New York 25th February for 5 nights staying at the New Yorker hotel on 8th Avenue. The hotel is really good, definitely check about paying resort tax. This is for amenities you may not use. WiFi in the rooms, gym etc. Our room was small but comfy, slept like a log in the comfy bed. The hot bath is great after full days walking around the city. Getting about via the subway is the best method. Just buy a metro card from any machine and load it with cash. There is so much to see and do. I booked our city pass early to go and see the main sights. The shops and bars and cafes are everywhere. You can eat and drink 24hrs. But you need a rest. I would definitely stay here again. We had no issues. It snowed when we came, but it just made it more beautiful. Bring lots of cash;4
Spent five nights here and could not fault it. Rooms are small but very clean and the shower and bath a godsend in the cold weather. Staff are helpful and it's a relaxed atmosphere in lobby. Great location opposite Madison Sq Garden, definitely recommend.;5
Lovely hotel we was upgraded to a room with a great view  corner room 1 window looks out to Madison Square garden the other window up to the empire state building room was clean small but was only a base most of the staff are very rude and abrupt  especially the security who check you room card before they let you get the lift the agent who checked us in was fantastic polite and friendly.;5
small rooms, great location, no hot water to shower in the morning! Clean property, friendly staff, price was a bit higher than other hotels but the location is great. Went to a hockey game at MSG very convenient, close and great food nearby.;3
Booked via Travel Rupublic for 5 nights- it does state on web site that there is a resort fee to be paid at the hotel but after researching this and reading previous reviews this seemed to be optional based on services used. This fee is NOT optional. The services you are paying $31 a night for are Wifi- which is advertised as ‘free internet’ on trip advisor and other booking sites- so it is not free, use of the gym- who the hell comes to NYC for a few days to waste their time in the gym?, use of the business centre- again why on earth would I want to do that unless I was here on business- which I was not and for making international calls from the room telephone- well being organised I have a bundle on my mobile for that so again did not use. My husband confronted management;3
This hotel was perfect for our stay, with the room overlooking the Hudson River and a nicely sized room. The location of the hotel was also great with it only being a few blocks from Times Square and Alain on the same street as the Empire State Building. The rest of Manhattan was also easily assessable with the subway station right next door. All of the staff was friendly and experienced in their job. The conjoined Tick Tock dinner tops off the hotels experience of being a fantastic. The food is superb and is served very quickly.;5
The hotel is in a great location but to be honest that is the only good thing I can say about it. I realise that the decor is Art Deco but it just looks drab. You exit the elevator to dark grotty hallways and once in the room it continues to look dull and grubby with brown carpets and tired funiture. I went to reception and said that I thought that my room was a little grotty to which I was told you have been upgraded to a room with a view. But my problem was the room was grotty i repeated. To be told yet again that I had a view !!!! on the day we checked out we needed to leave our bags as we were flying out in the evening, we were charged $20 to have our bags stored. Would not return or recommend this hotel .;3
Stayed here, rooms very basic reception didn’t really speak to us and give us any information about the hotel so not sure why I’ve paid £57 for a “facility fee” wind coming through the windows despite closed.   Heard the receptionist telling another to down grade us again not sure why they did this.    Wouldn’t stay again.;3
"I have been staying at the New Yorker for the past twenty years or so, and it has always been my home in New York City.  When the Ramada chain owned it, it was a fantastic place to spend a weekend, or in fact, a week or more! Since Wyndham has taken over,  the quality of service has taken a nosedive! This past weekend I was told that I had to pay for an early check-in, something that I had come to expect as a regular customer when it was available. I booked a ""view suite"" which turned out to have absolutely no view, and was VERY tiny! The refrigerator door was broken and was sagging down. Heat was inconsistent and difficult to manage. The shower was nothing but a trickle!!!!! In short, the room SUCKED!!!! As I said, I've been staying at the New Yorker for many years, and";2
Really enjoyed our stay at the New Yorker.  The location is convenient to Penn Station.  The room was clean, the beds comfortable and the staff friendly.  Mohamed upgraded us to a room with a view.  It was nice to watch the Empire State Building change colors.;4
12 hours ago I arrived back in Glasgow after 4 nights in New York. We arrived at the hotel earlier than check in was supposed to be, we were greeted by Mohammed who was extremely pleasant and helpful, so much so that he allowed us to check in early and allocated us to a room on the 36th floor with the most amazing view of the Empire State Building (picture from window attached). Room was spotless, WiFi was great, staff were all friendly but the view was outstanding! Would definitely recommend!;5
recently back from this great hotel, the location was perfect for me and the missus. we had booked into madison square gardens for the ice hockey and this hotel was on the door stop. the decor was amazing, art deco style made a quality lobby. all the staff were very friendly which i expected and none of them dissapointed. the room was a good size and the wifi was quality, never missed a beat. i cant speak highly enough of this hotel and when i return to new york i will be staying here.;5
This was our first visit to New York, I wished we had researched this hotel a little more before booking. When we booked the accommodation it clearly stated check in available from 3pm, we arrived at around 3.30pm. Waited in line only to be told that our room wasn’t ready. No problem if you would like to pay for a room upgrade. So we received the up selling routine.  We were tired from travelling so agreed the added fee over $100. Once my credit card had be swiped the guy on reception informed us that the previous guests had only just left, so that room wasn’t ready either. No problem you can leave your suitcases in the luggage room, and return in one hour. Once we got to the luggage room it was $5.00 per case, we refused to pay out anymore money for one hour. (If we had arrived;1
This was my 8th visit to NY and I must say the location was absolutely spot on for venturing out and seeing the best of Manhattan. The area is well served with food, restaurants and places galore to eat. The subway station for the red and blue line was right outside the door. The hotel is large and busy at all times. Staff are courteous and there is the added security of a visual key card check so random strangers can’t just walk off up to the rooms. Reception is constantly busy and sometimes the lines are a little long. We upgraded at reception for an extra $40 a night for a larger room with a Hudson River view. (3401). The Room was one of the largest I’ve stay in, in NY. Only tiny gripe was that the windows were drafty, one had blown and the damn toilet roll holder falls off;4
We stayed 5 nights here. Great location for walking anywhere in New York. We were lucky to have a high floor view of the river great at night. The room was small but ok the bath really deep hot water at night but not in the morning.  Could do with tea and coffee in rooms. Reception staff nice didn't use tick tock diner as plenty of places to eat.;4
Second visit and 10 years apart, sadly what was a little dated in 2008 is still in the same need or attention. Standard rooms have enough floor space for your suitcase that’s it, reception and lobby is as basic as you can get for what could be a very good iconic hotel. But in truth it’s a 2 star poor hotel in a good location.   A real shame this is sold with high expectations by many companies, pay a little more and get a nice modern hotel;2
My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights and it was lovely, a little wait for check in but that was fine. The room was super small, but hey, when you're in New York that's really the last place you want to be! Lots of amenities right on your doorstep.  The hotel is full of history, lots of original features here which is great, apart from you can hear all the neighbouring rooms turn a tap, turn a handle, flush the toilet, very hard to stay asleep when you can hear this, but we saw past that. Staff were all very friendly, hotel very well maintained and clean. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip.;4
Canceled my reservation weeks before reservation. One night’s stay was charged to my credit card. I have a cancellation number but was told I needed the name of the person who took the cancellation. Finally was referred to “Kelvin”. Two weeks later and still waiting for a response from Kelvin despite emails and phone calls.BEWARE🤣!;1
This was my 2nd time staying at the New Yorker for the Westminster KC dog show. The hotel is in the perfect location and all the amenities made my stay productive and comfortable. Both times I have shipped packages to myself at the hotel and they properly safeguarded and delivered them. I enjoyed using the Valet parking on this visit. I love the Tick Tock and its fun to have that right at hand.;5
I was really excited for the opportunity to stay here. After staying at a B and B my first trip to ny (pleasure), and at the Martinique on Broadway (westminister dog show stay) I thought a 4 star a little closer to Madison and Times Square would be amazing. I had two free nights with my rewards and paid for the other two nights. When I made my reservations I asked them to note that we had a dog in the room that is a therapy dog, I was advised the dog would be exempt from cleaning fees if I provided proof (no problem! Got that from St. John ambulance). I asked for an accessible room for more space. With a dog you can only book a metro room. I wanted to make sure we could put up the large crate (48 inches long, 30 inch wide) and all reviews said the room were tiny. So a week after;1
"Small room as expected, I don't think the queen bed was a queen, but rather a full.  Otherwise clean, basic.  Check in was easy enough. It's a huge, bustling lobby. Great location, 5 minutes from Penn Station which was great as it's where I was staying/going.   It's a perfectly reasonable 3 star, it does the job, it's clean enough, great location, basic room.  No remarkable perks or bonuses.  They charge to hold your bag, which at a budget hotel is ok I guess, but why not include that service in the facilities fee as it's about the only one I'll use?  ""free local and international calling?"" Uh huh, what would I ever do without that?  I'm docking one star for their aggressive marketing tactics and the nonsense mandatory nightly facility fee which cost 50% of the booking for";2
From the time you pull up to the New Yorker... it is service with a smile. Everyone is friendly and very helpful. The rooms are pleasant and housekeeping is always close by for assistance. To me, the showers are the best part of the room. Strong, forceful, hot and relaxing.;5
Arrived here on 20/2, was a bit dubious as read some reviews, but we needn't have worried,  amazing hotel , yeah maybe a little dated but this adds to its charm, friendly staff, couldn't do enough for us.  Tick tock is amazing they do the best breakfasts an dinners, not too expensive either, staff really friendly an go out of there way to accommodate you.  New York is fantastic we made some super memories here, an always felt extremely safe, when in doubt we asked NYPD an woth out hesitation they explained, we even rode the subway, we look forward to returning in the future an would definitely stay at the new Yorker again.;5
Excellent location beautiful room wonderful helpful staff I can definitely recommend this hotel  my room was spacious and comfortable the bed was extremely comfortable  I was able to walk from Penn station right to the hotel without any trouble dining options in the hotel are very good and exercise room and business center is available but I did not use them a must see is the museum of photographs in the basement documenting the history of the hotel k;5
We arrived in NYC via Amtrak/ Penn Station.  The hotel was a short walk from the station.  Since the room was not ready when we arrived we were able to check our bags for a small fee.  We were right down the street from the Empire State Building and within a 20 minute walk to all the mid-Manhattan sites (Rockefeller center, Theatre district, Time Square).  We were assigned a room on the 32nd floor with a breathtaking view of the city and the Empire State Building.  The room was clean, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom vintage but clean.  The hotel staff were friendly and personable.  Plenty of outlets for cell phone charging and good Wi-Fi connection.  My daughter had a memorable 17th birthday.;5
Stayed at the New Yorker in February for a 4 night break to New York.  Room was quite small but was offered an upgrade on arrival, but felt as we would only spend time in the room to sleep it was not worth the extra money!  We were very surprised how close the hotel was to everything, having Madison Square Garden directly opposite and Empire State a few blocks along the road.  We ate every morning in the Tick Tock diner which is attached to the hotel.  It was lovely and a good choice of food was available.  We had breakfast and then didn't need to stop for lunch which gave us more time to see more highlights.  As our flight was not due until 9pm we had no choice but to pay the $5 for each suitcase to be looked after so we could go out for the day.  We thought this was a bit;4
This hotel is perfectly placed to see everything you NYC.  We had 3 full days and managed to do everything we wanted to.  We booked into a metro double which had two bathrooms.  Lovely big room and comfy beds.  Downside was that it was dark - the windows looked into the building next door.  The next day I spoke to Linda on front desk (who was lovely and super helpful) and upgraded (at an extra cost, although she got me a good rate) to an executive double with a view on the 30th floor.  Great view and really nice, newly renovated room.  I would definitely recommend upgrading to a view.  Advantage with the exec room was that we got a coffee machine.  Definite bonus as they don't come as standard.  All of the staff were super friendly.  And a big shout out to John who organised our;4
Booked here whilst visiting NYC for my wife's birthday. Arrived easry hours, no wait g to check in, gentleman said, I see its someone's birthday and asked if my wife would prefer red or white, presented her with a bottle of wine and upgraded the room to a suit. This was perfect as both girls had their own double bed 1 was sofa but great) all very very comfortable. 2 rooms and well equipped bathroom. Fridge, safe and coffee machine. Really impressed. Lovely place to stay in a fantastic location. Staff helpful and friendly, never had to wait for lift. We all really enjoyed staying here and would stay again in a heartbeat. Thank you for making our stay so good. Fantastic trip!!!!;5
Pleasant stay at this hotel. We visited for 3 days as a couple.  Good points- nice friendly staff, nice safe feel about the hotel and rooms were good for a city hotel, small but clean.  Has a gym/fitness centre but don’t expect anything too fancy. Location is right in the middle of it, near Times Square so expect it to be very busy down this street. Can walk to Central Park in about 25 mins.  Very close to a subway station that has great and easy links to Brooklyn Bridge and many other locations easy as.  Bad points - think it’s a bit much to pay $5 per bag/suitcase for them to look after your bag in the luggage room considering it’s the hotel that has a 4pm check in time (rather late) Although rooms are nice and clean, sound does travel well through the walls and can hear quite;4
We were there for the dog show & it was a lot of fun staying in the same hotel as many of the dogs. Location was excellent for our needs. Rooms were larger than expected, comfortable, and quiet. Dining choices were good. I will stay there again next year.;4
We arrived at the hotel 2 hours prior to check in, not only were we allowed to check in, our room was upgraded to a room with an excellent view.  We were also brought up a bottle of wine and two glasses shortly after arrival. This was all provided by the lovely Lynda on check in.  The hotel is brilliantly located, with the empire and Times Square within a few minutes walk.  Take note and try avoid eating in the middle of Times Square, over priced and not that good.....but for this hotel, when we return to New York, THE NEW YORKER, will be our only choice.  From check in staff to security the place felt safe, and very friendly.  Check out tick tock out too, great breakfast.;5
Booked the wyndam hotel for my birthday stay in feb 2019.. it was amazing..   the room had everything we wanted including a mini fridge and a lounge, (we stayed in room 4001). There was a fitness centre and a hotel lobby that can be used for your duration of your stay there.   Easy access to Times Square, Empire State Building, Maddison square gardens, and penn street station. (Amazing location)  All of the staff are very friendly and very helpful.  Tick tock diner.. also very good value for money :)  Would definitely stay again at this hotel when visiting NYC again..  Thank you Wyndham :);5
I've been staying at the above hotel for the last 11 days and to say that the all the staff have been so helpful is an understatement. There is one member of staff that has gone above and beyond his job and his name is John he is a concierge at the hotel and he was absolutely amazing he went out of his way to look after me from organising my taxi last week to go to see the phantom of the opera on Broadway and organising my taxi to the airport later today I consider him a long life friend and hope that he gets the recognition he is due in so many ways nothing was never to much for him to take care of me as it was my first visit to to New York and to say I was petrified was easy to say but he made me feel at home and I'm greatly appreciative of that I will miss his smile every day;5
This is a very good hotel in a fantastic location. Easy access to Penn Station and subway, Times Square is only a 10 minute walk. Plenty of dining options within easy walking distance.   Rooms themselves were tidy and reasonably appointed. Only (minor) complaint would be the shower head - it is like showering under a pressure hose with inconsistent temperature.   Aside from this an excellent stay.;4
I have no bad thing to say about this hotel.  Our room was a queen size we stayed on floor 22 and room 55 it was bigger than I expected for New York!  Very close to subways, pen station and Times Square. Lots of shops and food places near by even tick tick located in the hotel.  There was a faculty fee per night but we knew about this as we emailed the hotel a few months before hand to see if there was any charges to the room. Also a deposit of $45 per night.  My partner used the gym a few days to make use of the faculty fee we was paying for.  Overall my first time in New York City and had a fantastic stay and would probably use this hotel for location again if I ever visited back.  Thank you Wyndham New Yorker.;5
Long time new Yorker customer and Wyndham rewards member. Everything went as expected from check-in to check-out. Great! After 20 years keeps experience keeps getting better and more floors renovated.;4
We have just returned to the UK having spent 5 nights in New York at the New Yorker Hotel. Prior to the trip we were apprehensive having read some negative reviews but we needn't have worried. On arrival the check-in staff were efficient, getting us up the line quickly. We were 3 hours early for check-in but our room was ready and we were delighted when we were offered a bottle of champagne as we were celebrating our honeymoon. The room itself on the 21st floor done the job. Initially we found it very cold and noisy with a crafty window, but again, on turning up the heating the room remained at a comfortable temperature for our stay...and after spending an average of 9 miles a day walking the noise of horns and sirens from outside didn't disturb our sleep. The rooms could maybe;4
We often stay at the New Yorker Hotel and we always enjoy this beautiful hotel and its location close to everything in Manhattan.  The staff is always professional, helpful and courteous and the hotel itself has many amenities so that you don't even have to leave it.  It has great restaurants, breakfast/coffee are in the Lobby and also has Keurig coffee machines in the rooms.  Its history and architecture makes it a very unique and special place to visit.  We always are treated like family and feel so comfortable staying there.  We always look forward to our next stay at the New Yorker.  It is always special!;5
This is our second stay at this hotel, and it will become our future hotel on our visits to New York. Staff are professional and helpful.  The room was clean and comfortable, though small, we weren't in it except to sleep.;5
Just returned from a 4 night stay. As everyone mentions, Location is fantastic, close to Time square, and Penn Subway Station on 34th. Also less than 5 min walk to Port Authority Bus Station on 8th Ave. Room (on floor 27) was dated, as was every area we were in (corridors etc, and our friends floor on 24). However it was clean. The housekeeping staff do a good job. Rooms a small, but this was to be expected. One issue we had was the temperature of the shower, it was extremely hot. On the first two mornings we tried everything to control this, on the 3rd day we reported it as it was actually too hot to stand under....and by this stage we were only turning on the COLD tap. We reported this issue. Reception staff assured us they would send an engineer. On our final morning,;3
We stayed here for 4 nights, the hotel is in a lovely building in a great location - right near Madison Square Gardens and Penn station. We stayed at this hotel as we found a great deal on Love Holidays that we couldn't turn down and it did the job for what we needed it for. Check in was pleasant and the staff were lovely. We had to pay $180 deposit which was fine and we were assured we would get that money back once we left the room in good condition. We took the elevator up to the 28th floor and found our room. The room was quite small, smaller than expected. We had booked a queen room and the bed certainly was not queen sized but it was very comfy. There was general wear and tear to the room and could probably do with being fixed up a little, but who really cares, you're not;3
I travelled to New York for the first time and stayed as a solo traveller at this hotel. Although, I also had family staying here, that makes no difference to my review. What a superb place. The location is great. The staff are superb. The hotel has such an authentic atmosphere. The Art Deco style, makes it feel old fashioned, but not in a way that makes it feel dated and past refurbishment time. It shouts out stories of romance, happiness and New York. The room I had was utterly comfortable. The comfy beds, the old fashioned taps and lights. All fantastically clean and well kept. The housekeepers care about this place, as do all the staff. You can just tell. I wouldn’t have wanted to go to New York and stay anywhere else. It was a home from home. When you go back to the hotel;5
Couldn't be happier with my recent visit to The New Yorker.  Everyone on staff went above and beyond to make my trip a memorable one.  Jessica at the front desk was quick to recognize my Windham Rewards status and get me to my room even earlier than promised.  My room was clean, comfortable and welcoming with a great view  of the city.....and breakfast at the Tic Toc Diner was delish!  The bell staff were outstanding!  In the midst of all the confusion of the dog show and fashion week, Franklin and Hector made sure that our arrival and departure were seamless.  Kudos to The New Yorker for being top notch!!;5
The hotel is very beautiful, clean looks newly renovated. The staff both front desk and the security were very friendly and cordial.    Our room was a king size bed. my only dislike was how small the rooms were.;5
Pros Fantastic location, clean rooms, 2 bathrooms (tho paid extra for this), large room, good security, comfy beds,   Cons  Rooms are freezing despite heating, rooms are very noisy and you can hear voices from the next room and their shower and taps running, we were woken up every morning around 6.30am by the shower in the next room, $5 charge per bag to leave your luggage if you have a late flight, $75 quote for late check out, not enough seats in the lobby for people waiting to leave;3
For the last few years, we have been staying at the New Yorker every time we visit Manhattan. It has great value and comfortable accommodations in a convenient location (Pen Station and multiple subway lines nearby).;5
We arrived at the New Yorker hotel very tired with 2 children in our party, when we checked in we got told they needed a credit card to take $250 plus tax off this was for the 5nights we was staying ,when we questioned this we got told we had to pay room tax per night (none of this was explained in the UK). I had previously emailed the hotel asking for a refurbished room on a high floor to which I got a reply stating this would happen. On checking in this wasn’t the case we was on floor 8 with no view at all, the bedroom was very small not big enough at all for 2adults and 2children, we just had to make doo as was told couldn’t do anything else as no other rooms available. Whenever we used the shower is flooded the whole of the bathroom and into the bedroom area, this was;2
The New Yorker Hotel--location, location, location.  See the sights--Madison Square Garden, Fifth Avenue, Empire State Building, Herald Square--close at hand. Enjoy true New York experience--ride the subways, walk the neighborhoods, meet the New Yorker people from the streets to the elite.  Eat in high end/ethnic cultural restaurants.  Weekend or week--wonderful trip.;4
Stayed at this location for a January event and was pleasantly surprised when we received an upgrade through Wyndham Rewards.  In addition the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.  The room we were put in had the extra room which made the stay even better, as rooms in NYC typically aren't the most spacious!  We go to the same event in January every year, and you can be sure that when we go again next year we'll be staying at the New Yorker again!;5
I have been attending the WKC shows since 1999 and have stayed at the New Yorker since 2000. Fabulous location, clean rooms and comfy beds. One short block to Penn Stn and MSG, 8 short blocks to Times Square and one long block to Macy's. Talk about location location location!  Rooms can be small but most of the hotels in that area are. Love the wonderful 24 hour Tick Tock Diner so in inclement weather you can just ride the elevator to a yummy meal. Suggestion... stick to diner food and you will not be disappointed. Anything fancy not recommended.;4
Just returned after a 5 night stay, we could not fault this Hotel, yes it is an older Hotel as people have stated but it adds to the charms. Surprised to read some of the comments. The staff were fantastic, friendly and helpful with any questions we had. The hotel felt so safe. The rooms yes they are small but its New York, they were very clean and bed was very comfy. We had a city view and it was just amazing to wake up and look out. The Tick Tock 24 hour Diner was super and had the nicest Big Waffle Breakfast (really going to miss that) service could not be faulted the staff are great and you can really see they work hard. Hotel is a perfect location for everything, and we would definitely stay hear again and hopefully will again soon;5
I stayed in this hotel back in October and had a great experience. I booked it again for my parents wedding anniversary and got them the romance package. They didn’t get a room with a view or their free breakfast coupons. They tried to ask a desk person about it several times but were told to come back. I called but could only be told what they were suppose to have. They were disappointed.;3
Had a fantastic time here hotel very central clean and warm was upgraded room view was of empire state amazing security was amazing cant go to lifts without showing card used tick tock diner was lovely and had a meal in restaurant on last night staff were fantastic and steak was wow this hotel made our first visit to NY very memorable thankyou xx;5
Great iconic hotel, reasonable rates.  Not top of the line by any means but really nice flavor of what things used to be with enough modernisation to make it work. Staff are really helpful, In house restaurant, Butcher & Banker is pretty good too.;5
"We were in town for the annual Westminster Kennel Club dog show which we attend every year.  We have stayed all over The City but this year we were bringing a dog to show and had been told The New Yorker was the best place to stay.  We have to agree, although I don't think you need to bring a dog to think so.  Our room was clean and well appointed, maid service very good, loved the fact there were three places to dine within the hotel, the Tick Tock Diner, a very good Italian Trattoria and the upscale steak house Butcher & Banker.  Also very convenient was the coffee bar in the Lobby which we took advantage of every morning and brought up to our room.  The hotel outdid itself offering a designated room as a potty area for the dogs, a $50 ""paw pass"" was obtained, the room was";5
Stayed for one week at the New Yorker Hotel. Good things were location and Tick Tock Diner. Not so good was the first room we stayed in, which was right next to a supply cupboard and  very noisy at night as well as some noise from outside. Also, the decor in this room was very dated with paint peeling off the bottom of the bathroom door and the door looking rotten in some places. Also. there was a really, and I mean really, cold draft coming through the seals around the edge of the double glazed windows.  We asked to be moved the following day and were moved to a room 6 storeys higher,  same size room, but again very draughty around the double glazing so much so that we had to request a spare Quilt to try and block the draft from the window, as well as an additional quilt for;2
Our NY Suite was adequate in housing 6 of us who were there for the Westminster Dog show including our show dog. Special thanks to Kelvin Diaz for accommodating our entire group of handlers and dogs on the same floor. Kudos to the entire staff for being extremely helpful and prompt whenever called upon. We'll be back again next year.;5
Just returned from 4 nights at New Yorker. Great location for sure. Door and security staff are great. The women on reception are less so. Very abrupt and prickly. The room was a good size spotlessly clean and beds very comfortable. Only real downside is no tea & coffee facilities in room and no room service as such. Great art deco hotel with loads of history.;4
I stayed with my daughter in Dec 2018 for a second time and during the course of the stay there was, unfortunately, cause for complaint. When I arrived home, via email I was dealt with extremely professionally by Megan who I believe is a customer service manager. She resolved my complaint within two days and is a real credit to your hotel. Don’t get me wrong it is a lovely hotel, great location, comfortable beds and showing your room passes before accessing the lifts made both myself and my teenage daughter feel safe. I’ve gone from being unsure about returning again to quite confident that we will. Thank you from a very happy customer;5
Very grand hotel with a great gatsby feel to it, our room was a little on the small side - but it was perfectly clean and bed was comfortable which is needed after long days sightseeing. We had some trouble with the shower not running very hot on out first day, but it seemed to fix itself after a day. Hotel were very accommodating to my request of a complimentary upgrade to help celebrate my fiance birthday.;4
We would like to commend all the staff at the Wyndham New Yorker, who carried out their duties excellently, extremely helpful and accommodating, our room 775 was a perfect environment to unwind, sleep following our days of sightseeing around the city!;5
After reading other reviews I fear people are missing the point of this hotel. The decor in all areas from the lobby to the corridors is definitely of Art Deco influences. What others are seeing as “outdated” is merely the hotels choice of decor in line with the style and age of the building. We were offered an upgraded room with Empire State Building views for $10 per night which was great. The resort fees are all discussed with your travel agent when booking and are clear to see on the website so again unsure on why people insist on making that an issue. We had a lovely stay here, felt safe, close to many of the must see sights of New York and subway station across the street.;5
First of all the tap water is so dirty so showering was out of the question (see photo). Paid for a suite - three people got one bed?!? What are they thinking in the reception. Never paid so much for such poor quality.;1
When we arrived late at night they knew it would be three of us, we booked a suite *wow* and payed almost $500 for one night, when we came to the room we had one bed and one pullout bed that wasn’t even made so we had to call room service and they came 45 mins later. Got the feeling of walking into a hotel room like 50 years ago. Yellow and brown sofas, the curtains.... just no. The rooms are bad, and the carpet is really not ok. I really don’t wanna know what’s been on that one... This hotel needs a renovation, ASAP! Wouldn’t recommend to anyone and will not come back. One thing that’s good is that beds are comfy.;2
I have stayed here before and had a wonderful time. This time was horrible. The first night our hotel key didn’t work. Instead of changing the cards like the security guy said they made us change rooms. They told us we would be upgraded. Our room was the exact same with a worse view. Second night, keys don’t work again. Third night, keys don’t work again. Absolutely ridiculous when you are paying a “resort fee,” plus $70 for parking per night. Will not be staying here again.;1
Very nice and clean hotel with large rooms. Very focused on guest safety as you need a room key to show to get from lobby to elevators for guests.  Very attentive to guest satisfaction and even had someone knock on the door to ask how the service was. Two restaurants are off the lobby( not owned by the hotel) one is Italian and the other a Diner with excellent food and is very convenient. I've stayed in NYC many times and wish I had stayed here those times. Just one block from Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station in one direction and Macy's in the other direction. This is my NYC hotel choice for all future trips;5
At first appearance the lobby looks nice, very Art Deco. At reception when booking in we was told about the room tax being $23 per night, when asked what it was for we was told for the WiFi. I asked if there was water and drinks in the room and was told no it was extra. Having traveled from the uk I was quite disappointed by this. The room tax seemed to be unneeded really. When we caught the lift to our floor and got out you could see it really did need redecorating, we was on floor 28. We opened the door to our room to almost trip on the bed!. Thankfully it was just for sleeping in as it was rather small dated and the bathroom was worse!. We nearly scalded ourselves in the shower as getting the water temperature right was nearly impossible, towels were very small but clean and;2
"Guys, I hate to complain, but felt compelled to do so in this case. Just overall bad experience for me so far. Been here for one night only so far.   First impression: This is not uncommon in NYC, but the size of this standard Queen Bed room is very small. Basically, I felt like I was walking into a walk in closet. This doesn't bother me so much as I am here to sleep and attend a convention at Javits. (Which is  short walk away)   Room is outdated and unclean: I'm not sure when the last time these rooms were renovated, but a little facelift wouldn't hurt. Carpets, tiles and furniture look like they were pulled from the ""Casino"" movie set. You know the one with DeNiro in it. The bathroom knob is rusty and when you look at the floor, it's hard to distinguish whether the floor is";2
Just love everything about The New Yorker. Great location, rooms are nice and clean. Great towels, makes a difference in my book. And there are the two restaurants downstairs, which is awesome, especially if you don't want to travel outside when you first get there and are tired from traveling.  The staff is super helpful and housekeeping is right there if you need something.;5
This was a spectacular hotel, with awesome support staff and amenities! They were dog friendly. The room and view was spectacular! My room was spacious and had a good view. I felt very safe there. I will stay there the next tiime I am in New York!;5
The location is excellent (Penn St.) , the history of this hotel is capturing (N. Tesla lived here for 10 years) but most of all it's cozy , comfortable and very very friendly.  Tons of places to grab a meal around and in the hotel itself. Close to everything . I landed At Newark Airport and in 40 minutes I was across the hotel at Penn Station.  The place is quiet , when you need it (in the rooms) and buzzing on the streets around. Like I said in the title I love this Hotel. It was my first time and definitely not the last. BTW , Love the splendor and the decor of the rooms and the stuff is super friendly;5
Went there for a weekend, the location is amazing, in the heart of NYC, for me being close to my training was great, the room was tiny, but not a bad view, it was clean and elegant, yes old but well maintained, if i ever needed to be in the same area, i will book the same room, price was reasonable for this crazy pricy area.;4
The staff was courteous, fast to answer and serve, rooms were very clean  Tnis is my 2 nd time staying here for Westminister Dog show. I felt secure, Hotel valet service was slow so I self parked when Iarrived.;5
Charming 1930 hotel with excellent, friendly staff!  Located in midtown Manhattan walking distance to MSG and Time Square.   Rooms are small but very comfortable!  Security is great your not going to get on the elevator without showing your room key.  Late in the evening if you are sitting in the lobby you will be asked to show your room key.  I am happy to be a repeat customer.;5
The room was excellent and once I got to the front desk to check in it went smoothly.  The security team is right on the ball checking everyone.  The lobby restaurants were excellent this year.  Rooms were clean and well stocked.  Beds a bit soft, but the water pressure and available hot water was good.  Overall a decent price for NYC and the location is great.  The taxes will shock you.  The lobby very comfortable and nice.  Overall I would suggest this hotel especially if you have business in the Garden area.;5
Awesome stay amazing hotel & customer service, excellent location. Room with a view of empire state building & madison sq garden WOW!!!! stayed here for my husbands 50th a big shout out to Rachael at check in who organised a bottle of bubbly to our room on the day of hubbys birthday much appreciated. Tick tock diner was suberb, food was excellent have to mention sam the bartender he was a true gent & so welcoming.Thank you wyndham new yorker forr making our first time in new york truly special.;5
Beautiful lobby, not indicative of things to come. Staff where friendly. Hotel corridors, lifts etc where very tired and grubby. Well worn.  Room was freezing ! But it was February in a cold snap so hey ho. However, the bathroom was a different thing altogether sub zero temps. No heating at all in there. Old and utilitarian. It is central but I would forgo that for a coffee machine or a bottle of water in the room. The WiFi IS NOT COMPLIMENTARY AS STATED, ITS AN EYE WATERING $22 a night !!!  This included use of the gym and business facilities ??? On a birthday trip and I’m a disabled elderly mum. But still paid for use of the gym !! I was told, rather patronisingly , it’s there if you want it m’am Non negotiable😡.  We could have had a coffee maker in the room  for $25 a night.;2
lovely hotel, the price was very reasonable. location was excellent for MSG and Penn Station but also within easy walking distance to sites. The Tick Tock Diner was excellent!! fell asleep with a clear view of the Empire State Building.;5
"Front Desk and any other person who answered the phone was just shuffling me around instead of trying to help answer questions. Staff was unable to change any reservations that I made online without an email even though I made the effort to call and confirm changes. Overall the booking and confirmation process and dealing with staff over the phone was the worst experience I've had in the ""hospitality"" industry.";1
Couldnt praise this place enough, so much character, in the building and the staff (John the concierge, a true NY Italian!) were amazing every step of the way! The building is 1930 deco, and its been really well looked after. From arrival you are greeted by marble and gold, every inch shinning. Staff cant do ehough to please! Located on 34th and 8th, its a hop to Times Square, a tube below also takes you across the city. Opposite is Madison Square Gardens. 3/4 mile from Central Park.  Rooms are modern, but with that feeling of the period left in tact. Views from the 20th floor and above, just amazing!! We stayed on the 35th looking at the Empire State, just WOW!! Taxis are a plenty, as are busses, shops and eateries are all around, including the TickTock Dinner, which was;5
In an age where service is lacking the New Yorker has found a way to provide exceptional service. The room was clean spacious and the price was very reasonable. The food and cocktails in the restaurants were very good. The building is very well maintained. Definitely stay there again.;5
Clean, comfy and a great area.  The hotel is clean, especially the rooms. The beds are very comfortable. The rooms are of a good size. It is in a great area of Manhattan, very central to start your days out in NYC;5
We stayed in the New Yorker hotel from 8th - 15th December. Our first impression of the hotel was that it was very grand and not what we are used to back home (travel lodges and premier Inns) Being an absolute Christmas nut I was amazed by the beautiful tree in the lobby. The staff were very friendly and checked us in quickly. Our room on the 29th floor was perfectly comfortable and the views across the rooftops of Manhattan were also very breath taking. The hotel is situated just a few minutes walk from the empire state building which is a must. Also the subway is right across the street and is easy to use. Times Square is around 10 mins walk. The hotel is in a fantastic location, and should we be lucky enough to visit the city again, it'll be where we stay. Five stars well;5
Everyone from the doorman, bellman, front desk, reservations, catering and sales give fabulous service.  I have stayed st this hotel for 17 years and never been disappointed.  It always feels like i’m “Coming home” when I arrive.;5
I always choose the New Yorker for my 6 monthly family trips to New York. For me there is no choice - great location, great staff, fabulous building and comfortable room (I always have a twin double bed metro room). The hotel has a lot of character and history. The staff cannot do enough for you. I feel immediately at home as soon as I arrive and wouldn’t stay anywhere else.   Perfectly located for all the sights and shows. Easy to get anywhere as it’s right next to the subway/Penn station.;5
Myself and daughter have just returned from our trip and stayed at the New Yorker for 5 nights, hotel is lovely and historic, staff were fantastic, room was an adequate size for us, very clean and warm and lovely bath tub with plenty hot water, we could pick no faults at all, thank you to all staff for making our special time away so fantastic, would recommend;5
We have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel. Out first impressions were that the hotel appeared to be dated and the room was basic and small. However, we were on floor 36 and had the most amazing views! The hotel is in the most amazing location as it is within walking distance of most tourist attractions. We were out all day and only returned to the hotel to sleep for a few hours before being back up and out sightseeing again. There is a tick tock diner attached to the hotel which we had breakfast in most most mornings and staff were very friendly.  We would recommend the hop on top off bus to get you around the city, pick the right one and it also includes a hop on top off ticket which is great to get to see the statue of liberty.  On reflection we would most;5
Jose was phenomenal! He handled me with compassion and professionalism.  He calmed me down and diffused a potential blow up.  My reservations were incorrect. Wyndham assured me it would be corrected by the time I arrived on Saturday. It was not. Jose patiently worked with me until the issue was resolved. We were able to check in our rooms early. Hats off to Jose for making my experience wonderful and displaying extraordinary customer service skills. He would not let me leave until I was completely satisfied. Thank you Jose!!!;5
I return to this hotel every year for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.  The staff go out of their way to make you feel like an honored guest.  Two in particular, Mohammed and Neida are so wonderful with their help to make sure my stay is always superb.   I had to ask for a few things to be brought to the room.  There was absolutely no wait....a staff member showed up almost immediately.  When I thought a lightbulb had blown out, an electrician arrived within minutes.  He checked the fixture, and then discovered I had inadvertently pulled out the plug. Neida and Mohammed both welcomed me with their cheerful manner, and did everything possible to accommodate my needs during my stay. They made recommendations for their own restaurants in the hotel, and were ready to answer my;5
The hotel is famous for many things, one being where Nikola Tesla lived and sadly died back in 1945. There are still questions being asked about what happened once he died and all of his research stored at the hotel.  But back to the drink, to the left of the lobby, downstairs is the Bank Vault 'Butcher and Banker' where you can drink and also dine. Very atmospheric.;4
Stayed here at the beginning of this year, was a lovely stay and the staff were so kind. The room was a nice size however the shower didn’t work very well and water came out of both the bath tap and the shower head at the same time causing very little power in the shower water. Other than that our stay was great, this hotel is so close to the Empire State Building and Times Square! It’s also not too much of a walk to 5th Avenue.;4
The staff are lovely and the rooms are huge for New York! It’s close to lots of sights. We really enjoyed ourselves and highly recommend this hotel for a family, couples, or business. We will go back!;5
Great hotel all the staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms clean but dated like most original hotels in New York. The hotel is dog friendly and we had a couple of noisy dogs in the next room, mentioned this to receptionist and she upgraded us to a better room. Excellent service!;5
Clean, great location, a very professional staff.  Would highly recommend this hotel when visiting NYC for business or pleasure. If driving park your car across the street at the Icon garage. The cab and rapid transit will handle your transport needs.;5
After choosing to visit New York our break took us to the WNY Hotel it was a pleasure to stay there the hotel was in a perfect location to tour NYC . The hotel has a nice retro feeling and some great features and a small Museum  where you can find out all about the history of the hotel and the people that have stayed at the hotel the one person that stands out is Mohamed Ali  all the staff are very polite and it is nice to see that you feel very safe as there is always someone that checks your room card before they allow you to use the lift to go to your room . As for the location as you walk through the revolving door in front of you stands the Empire State Building and across the road to your right is Madison Square Garden and Times Square is only a couple of subway stops away;5
Great hotel in Manhattan, close to Empire State and subway. I walked from here to Central Park and Ground zero, close to Tavern bar, great food and drink. Rooms clean, nice staff, buffet breakfast ok too.;5
We stayed here at the beginning of December, it is a great location, being within walking distance to the majority of attractions in NYC. In my opinion, the decor is very dated, I felt like i was in the 1930's (what I imagined it to be like). The beds were small also, I'd say the same size as a UK small double. My wife and I aren't huge and we had just about enough room, I can imagine larger couples would struggle and would actually need to the two doubles in the room.   The rooms wasn't too much of an issue as we were out all day. Being a city hotel, it is very noisy at night with the passing traffic but this is accepted. The hotel is clean, can't grumble at that. The tick tock diner was fantastic (separate review to follow)... Would I stay here again? Possibly.;3
I needed to change from a twin to a suite for a trip next week to NYC and was fortunate enough to connect with Neida a natural commicator and excellent representative of the Hotel! Not only was she able to deal with my request efficiently, but more importantly with nice good humour and really nice attitude - Well done Neida, you are a star in your hotel *****;5
Absolutely loved this hotel. Location is great, so handy for Times Square, train station etc. Also plenty of shops and cafes around it. Hotel was also very clean and staff friendly. Tick tick restaurant located in hotel was amazing for breakfast and desserts. We also had a view of the Empire State Building from our bedroom which was amazing. Definitely recommend and would definitely return.;4
"Just returned from 4 nights here. Hotel location is excellent but hotel inside is very dates. Rooms are small and dark, plug sockets are not practical at all and limited storage space. Very clean though cant be faulted for that. Reception was very rude on check in I had 3 rooms booked and was told that she would ""not be booking all the rooms in - one at a time is how she would do it"" !! Resort tax not sure what you pay it for free WIFI and that is it as when I tried to make a call to the UK from the room, surprise it did not work. Who wants to use a gym and business centre when there for 3 days? this is included in resort tax but really! Tick tock diner is a must next door, good food service a bit hit and miss but overall great. I would stay again if the price was right, but";3
Went to NY with 3 friends, we shared a room with 2 beds and it was amazing. The hotel is very clean, beds are comfortable, rooms with an amazing view, the decoration is cool, bathrooms are a little small but its ok. The price we payed was very low compared to other hotels nearby. It is located near Times Square, you can easly go there walking. Also, the dinner downstairs has delicious food.  I don't advise buying vouchers to the hotel breakfast, because they only serve toasts, juice and coffee (a breakfast when you need to discover all that NY has to offer needs to be more complete lol). Still, nothing bad to say about it, loved it.;5
We stayed here in January for my birthday. We thought it was a lovely hotel with a central location in New York very close to the Empire State Building. We took the air train from JFK to Jamaica and then took the train from there to Penn Station which is very close to the hotel. Check-in was smooth and we were given a free upgrade and a bottle of champagne for my birthday, which was a lovely gesture. The room was not huge but was a reasonable size and the heating was adequate. There was good storage space. It was spotless and cleaned to a high standard on a daily basis. We also had lovely views of the city. Security was very good and we had to show our room card to the security personnel each time we used the lift, which gave us great piece of mind, Perhaps it was because it was;4
Where do I even begin! Phenomenal! We were given an earlier check in to our rooms due to arriving earlier than expected, with this holiday being a present for my 21st as a first timer in New York City. I was upgraded to a room with a room of the Empire State Building from the 27th floor and must I say what a spectacular view! Many thanks to Mohammed on Reception for doing this for us. Such a truly beautiful hotel. Each member of staff gives you excellent customer service and nothing ever seems to much for them. They truly go the extra mile.  Rooms are plenty big enough, beds are shockingly comfortable knowing previous hotel stays with lovely firm pillows to rest your head after a long day. Tick Tock being the 24/7 dinner downstairs within The New Yorker provides tasty  meals 24;5
The location is hard to beat to go anywhere in Manhattan, assuming you are ok with tourists. The hotel is clean and comfortable. I had absolutely no problems, no security concerns. My room was great for Manhattan and the common areas were well tended to. The elevators were fast enough. An outstanding front desk employee, Samira, made up for the (not uncommon) late afternoon check-in time. The New Yorker is a good place.;5
If you’re looking for luxury it’s not for you. If you’re looking for comfortable and welcoming it’s perfect. Perfectly situated surrounded within easy walking distance from Penn station, Macy’s, Times Square,  Empire State and Madison sq garden.  The beds are fantastically comfortable and there’s a diner and bar in the hotel for a convenient bite of breakfast or a bedtime drink...... what more would you need? Would definitely book here again on another trip.;5
Stayed a week. Have stayed 3 times before. Room this time was quite small. Water temperature overall was good, although a bit sporadic and ran cold a few times. A great hotel to experience as it has a lot of history including a bit of a museum experience downstairs, but the main issue for me was the heating system and fan cannot be separately operated, so if it is cold or extra hot, it goes on strong and then shuts off deadly quiet. The fan has a manual option but I was told manual is not an option. Would be an easy fix, but for heavy sleepers I would guess no problem - I just prefer continuous fan especially with traffic always noisy- but if not for that an easy 4 stars for service, nice 24 hour diner below, strong wifi, great location, old but clean, fast elevators, and a not;3
This is a great place to stay if you want to shop the garment district and you're coming in on Amtrak.the hotel is literally one block across the street from the train station and within five to six blocks almost all the garment district fabric stores are right there;5
Close to Penn Station, I always enjoy staying here for business travel in NYC. The coffee maker, bathroom & room size make it worth it to upgrade to the executive room if you can. And the on-site dining options are convenient as well (diner, bar/trattoria, and upscale steakhouse) Nice views & martinis!;4
Wonderful one week stay. Many thanks to Jolson for his help and great service throughout my stay. Lovely spacious room on the 31st Floor, views of the city, spotless. Housekeeping and all staff very helpful and friendly. Hotel location perfect for walking, catching the subway train and the bus on 7th or 8th St depending on whether going uptown or downtown. I was a returning customer after visiting previously 20 years ago. Hope to do it all again in the near future.;5
Rooms are very old. Especially bathroom. Very noisy too. Never use valet parking.they charge additional 40% fee and they do not say. You learn when you are paying it. Beds are old small. Very good place though.;1
I was going up for a special one-night-only experience - a memorial tribute to my old boss Paul Taylor at Lincoln Center. I had to be on a 6:00 am train, so needed to be in the Penn Station neighborhood. I stayed out even later than I expected to, sharing memories and drinks with friends and arrived at the desk to check in at 12:50 am. The lady was very nice and you would never have known how late it was.    My room was spotless,  the art was very nice, and the amenities were as promised.  A very comfortable bed. I did not have time to shower, so I can't speak to the water pressure, etc., but the staff was again very cordial when I left, about 4.5 hours later, making sure I knew which entrance was better for Amtrak vs NJ Transit. It's a very old-school place that made a great;4
Stayed here in January with my fiancée to celebrate her 27th birthday. Stayed for 4 nights.   We stayed on the 27th floor and had a pretty poor view. Could see the corner of MSG and that was about it.   Room was small and old fashioned.   Pros: The hotel is in a great location. Just a short walk to Times Square and other locations. Very reasonable price.  Cons: Outdated rooms. No fridge in room. $22prpn resort fees.   I recommend staying at this hotel if you want a cheap room with a good location to go and explore the city. Wouldn't want to stay here if I was going to spend a lot of time in the room.;4
Stayed here for 3 nights in a standard queen sized bed. The bed was comfortable. The room was compact to say the least! there was less than 12 inches space between the edge of the bed and the TV/ drawer storage to squeeze through. ( I am average size @ 80 kgs! ) TV is flat screen but a bit dated. Bathroom shower, very fiddly to get the desired water temperature. No extraction. Night time views of the lit up neighbouring buildings from the room windows were memorable.  Impressive foyer and reception. Unfortunately, public seating is totally inadequate for the no of guests using or wishing to use the space. There is a coffee and light refreshment counter. Also the Tick -Tock Diner attached to the foyer is popular. Prices are mid range. There are 'facility charges' added to the;3
The didn't give me my incedenteals back I don't know about you yet I'm never going in that bitxh again I work hard for my money they tried to cause confusion to my bank. Talking about file fukk you and the claim keep the money.. I don't need extra trouble in my life. My husband goes outside and smoke he never has company and plus when we not in hotels we sleep on the subway.. so you know I'm not fukkn with them;1
Just returned back from New York yesterday after 4 days. The whole experience was fabulous from start to finish. This was defiantly helped by staying at this hotel. The location is perfect. Penn station is literally next door so you can be on the subway within minutes of leaving your room. Or if you want to walk everything is within walking distance. The hotel its self is very big. Our room was on the 21st floor. Clean and exactly what you need it for. The room was an ok size for 2 people, storage for cases and your shopping was a little bit limited but didn't make a difference to how much we enjoyed it. The beds were very comfortable and we both slept soundly after full on days walking. Would defiantly stay at this hotel again.;5
My husband and I stayed here last May, had a great view from our room.  The 'art deco' bathroom was very small and basic.  I emailed before we arrived in New York to request tea making facilities in our room (I am British!) and was told they couldn't offer this, for a very large in hotel in New York I think this was poor service.;2
Stayed here for 3 nights. Rooms are a little on the small side but didnt bother us as we were out most of the day anyway. The views of the empire stat building were outstanding and the was very comfortable, and shower very good too. What more could you ask for?;5
We had a large group (8) of adults, two rooms, and everyone arriving on different schedules. The hotel was very accommodating in working with us to get everyone checked in to the room they needed at the time they needed, and still having the reservations handled under my name. As a Wyndham rewards member, we were upgraded to slightly larger rooms with a view, which was nice. I don't know if there was a better view. We had the view of skyscrapers under construction, so not the greatest view, but still a view of the city. It is VERY close to Penn Station which was nice for easy transportation. And it was within walking distance of many places we wanted to go. The only downside? We could have stayed longer and seen even more.;5
My husband and I stayed here to celebrate a birthday.  Was a lovely surprise on arrival to find out that they had upgraded us to a suite and a bottle of champagne had been sent to our room as well.  The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is in a great location with easy access to transport, shops and things to do.  Would recommend the hotel to others and would defintiely stay there again.  Thank you The New Yorker for a great stay.;5
The New Yorker Hotel, opposite from Penn Station, is close to transportation, and a very friendly, fashionable place to park your luggage and get out in Manhattan. The room was roomy, the view was fantastic (Empire State Bldg out one window, the New World Trade Center out the other.) Madison Square Garden lit up the night. Macy's, JC Penney, Target and AMC Theatres are within one or two blocks walking distance. So convenient, clean and comfortable.;5
My family of 5 (3 12 year olds) stayed comfortably in a queen suite with pullout couch and rollaway bed. It was more spacious than I expected for a Manhattan suite. I was worried about having to wait a while for the elevator being on the top floor but we never waited more than a minute or two. Great location with easy access to Penn Station and everyone loved tick tock diner. We will definitely stay here again.;5
We stayed in the New Yorker hotel this January , it was a lovely hotel staff were so so lovely rooms can be a bit small but we were moved to a bigger room with no problems at all . Staff were on hand all the time and you could ask them anything about the area , would stay here again;4
While I always enjoy the “old New York” feel of this hotel, the hidden facility fees put a damper on my trip, especially since they refused to put it on the company card that booked the trip without 19 authorizations and a spare kidney. Better to just raise the room rate and be transparent with guests. The $30 per night doesn’t bother me. The principle does. Poor form, Wyndham.;3
Just back in Ireland from another great visit to this fabulous Hotel.. staff are brillant so helpful and informative big shout out to Lovely Linda at front desk who is so kind and professional. we will be back in april for my moms birthday.. cant wait;5
Stayed here for 4 nights at the end of January 2019, and we where very impressed, we had read a few reviews complaining about room size and heating, but being in the heart of Manhattan, we found it a comfortable size, and the heating was fine.. It is in a. Perfect location to explore NYC.. With so many attractions and landmarks within walking distance.. And subway Stations and taxis close by if you don't want to walk. Was very happy with front of house service and housekeeping, would stay here again.. Only dropped a star as no tea/coffee making facilities in room, but it is NYC, coffee is pretty readily available!;4
This is not likely to be the smartest hotel you’ll ever stay in, but it is very conveniently located, and is good value for money.  Right near Penn Station so it is easy and cheap to get there from JFK.  Great local deli nearby, which is really convenient for a nice breakfast or late night snack.;4
Is one of the WORST hotels I’ve stay in my life. The only good thing was the location because they have other hotels for better price. The bed was “king”, the water was only boiling hot or mega cold, and with the cold temperatures and my heater was not working. After this I complained to the front desk and her response was “My heater at home doesn’t work neither”  This is without adding that the room is not as they show in the picture. The room is small, everything is outdated with mold and rust.;1
Stayed here for 3 nights with 2 friends.  We got a taxi from JFK prices at $63.  Check in was easy and we were given our key card for room 3222.  On 32nd floor.   The view was amazing of the Empire State.  We had 2 double beds for 3 adults, room was clean and tidy.  Great location.  2 minute walk from Penn station? McDonald’s across the road.  Tick tock diner is 24-7 and attached to the hotels.  City tax was payable on check out.;4
We were greeted by Mohamed on the main desk and he had the best customer service and treated us so kindly: it is lovely a lovely hotel in a great location with realy friendly staff. Would definitely recommend to people;5
Have been to NYC several time but this was the first time at this hotel.  The hotel is huge, the staff are friendly and the rooms are a decent size for New York.   The hotel is close to the Garden so if you're going to a concert or game this location is perfect. There are a ton of homeless people around the hotel though so be prepared to be hassled going in and out of the hotel. Still a good hotel though.;4
Got this hotel at a really good price and have to say in the most positive feedback. Positive  Good location everything in walking distance and right by subway for longer journeys. Rooms whilst small are clean and I have stayed in smaller ones in New York such as the Edison.  House keeping stood out as friendly and doing a great job.  Negative  The hotel tax. Told it paid for use of gym, business suite and faster WiFi. None of which I needed I was on holiday. I did go into the business suite to print off boarding passes. It was basically two computers with printers. There was no toner and limited paper. It felt a little like money grabbing, for example it was $3 per bag to store them in the day of departure including a small handbag.  In conclusion positive stay with small;4
Took train into Penn station. Hotel was a super easy walk. Checked in around 7:00 p.m. No one else in line so we had our room keys within minutes. Excellent security as we entered the elevator hallway. All staff thus far being friendly and knowledgeable. Stayed for two nights. Room was small but fine for two adults. Beds and pillows were very comfortable.Room & bath were very clean. When we first entered the room it was 82 degrees but it cooled right down after we adjusted the thermostat.  We ate at the Tick Tock diner for breakfast. Very good and super fast. We ate dinner at Trattoria Bianco. Food was very good and prompt. Our server was Myah (sp) and she was fantastic!! We went back two more times just for cocktails to be served by her! The only thing missing in my opinion was;5
I absolutely LOVE the New Yorker and it is perfectly situated in Midtown. The location is most convenient for me and the area feels safe at all hours. I LOVE the attached Tick Tock 24-hour diner and the ESSEN store just one block away (also 24 hours with smoothies, salad bar, etc so you can eat healthy!), The garment district is super fun and I love looking at all the amazing fabric and trim. Of course, subway connections to anywhere you need to go are right outside the door. I will NEVER EVER stay at any other hotel in NYC! They upgraded me to the most beautiful room in the whole hotel with 2 balconies! 2 TVs (I don't even watch TV), 2 bathtubs! (Very important to take bubble baths each night in Manhattan to relax after all the shopping and excitement on the street). I think;5
Extremely perfect location. Very beautiful hotel.  Lovely clean spacious rooms with great views of NY City. Comfy warm beds with great pillows and soft clean sheets.  Very nice, knowledgeable and helpful staff.;5
Good location (we had an event at MSG) Staff was helpful and did a nice job. The rooms are SMALL but everything was clean. Was nice there is a 24 hour diner attached to the hotel. I would recommend this hotel for a midtown stay;3
Spent 4 nights in this hotel in November for Thanks Giving with 3 friends....the room was a bit small for 4 people but it was clean so we managed....this hotel is in a great location with Macy's only a block away and the bus station very near as well.;4
We visited the New Yorker with friends and found all the staff friendly and efficient from the concierge who took our bags from the taxi to the reception and restaurant staff.  A special mention to the lovely Samira who was so very helpful. Our rooms, whilst in need of redecoration, were clean with very comfortable beds and powerful showers. The facility fee paid direct to the hotel includes wi-if and use of the telephone in the bedroom.  We also had to pay a deposit of $45 per night which was refunded after our return home.  We were not aware of this so it did put a hole in our budgeted spending money. It would be better to simply hold the credit card details and debit the money if any damage is found. The Tick Tock Diner was good for basic food (the cakes looked delicious) but;4
Do not stay at this hotel. This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel and I travel weekly for business. On average I spend 3 nights a week in a hotel and this was literally the worst overall experience i have ever had.;1
"I got to New York on business 1-2 times/month, arriving at Penn Station,  Just two blocks away is a place I look forward to visiting every time.  Here are my top three reasons: 1. The front desk staff!!  They are kind, patient, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and efficient.  They go out of their way to ensure that every single visitor has a great experience--often including the challenges of communication across languages and cultures. 2. The GYM.  Yes, gym, not ""fitness center.""  The basement of the hotel is outfitted with a large space and many different kinds of equipment, including some I've never encountered in a hotel before.  3. The VIEWS.  The New Yorker has amazing incredible views from all sides. I can often see the water. I love looking out over the lights at night,";5
This year I decided to give my bride a weekend in NYC for Christmas.   I selected the hotel because it was about a block from Penn Station.   Arriving around 4 PM on Friday, we were warmly greeted by Krystal (sp?)  I’d paid for a standard queen size room. Much to our delight, she put us in a room on the 40th floor, facing the Empire State Building.   To us, it was a suite, with a bar sink, doors to the bedroom, living room, two TVs.   The place is rich in history, built around 1930. Be sure to go down to the basement to see the old literature and news features, Tesla lived there.   Although I detest the tax-like “facility fees” in an expensive city, the unexpected upgrade was greatly appreciated.   Floors 21-40 have their own elevators. We never had to wait more than 1-2;4
On my trip to New York I went to visit the American Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. I flew a helicopter over the Big Apple.  In New York I ate bagels, it's a mixture of sandwich and donut.  I also ate hots dogs, meatlof, chicken wingses, cupcakes and pancakes. These New York specialties are delicious but very caloric.   New York is a great city, I recommend it. Next time I will visit the Statue of Liberty and I will go to the 9/11 Museum.;5
Fabulous 1930 Hotel lots of history, has its own coffee snack bar plus tick tick restaurant open 24hr. Friendly and helpful staff. Rooms compact has everything you need . Comfortable beds shower/ bath lovely towels. Bag storage. Brilliant pace for all your site seeing in and around NYC. Next to  Pen station , madison square garden and five minute walk to Empire State Building.  Fifteen minutes time square half hour Central Park .;4
Neida was extremely helpful and pleasant! I needed to change my reservation and she was very understanding and helped meet my needs. Excellent service!! I always look forward to saying at the New Yorker!;5
So convenient to transportation, so convenient to mid-town. A lovely mid-level hotel with a proud, checkered history that has come back to life. Comfortable, clean and elegant without attitude. Perfect for our mid-week NY getaway. Bonus: the rooms where Nikola Tesla spent his last years are respected.;4
Hotel is a gem. Rooms are clean.  It’s a great deal for the location! Love the Art Deco styling. Staff is helpful and there is great security, which is an added bonus. The rooms are not huge, but you are in NYC so you don’t need a lot of space. Everything we needed was in the room. The bed was very comfortable!;5
After reading some of the reviews we made the decision to go and try it out. What can I say except our stay was nothing but fantastic. From arriving late evening we were greeted by lovely friendly staff, it was our 10th wedding anniversary and we were very lucky with an upgrade to the 40th floor with a great room including a suite and quite sized bed. We also had a lovely bottle of champagne complimentary from the hotel too, our room was clean and had everything we needed. Now the hotel location is fantastic literally 4mins walk to madison square gardens and an 8minute walk to Times Square. We had a fantastic time there and would definitely return as the location was perfect, no horns constantly beeping and road works etc.   Don’t believe all you read guys.;5
We have had a four night break here celebrating our anniversary, on check in was very fast and Jessica was really helpful as we wanted to upgrade our room, she found a perfect room for us at a great price, she also gave us a lovely bottle of wine to celebrate our anniversary.  Our room was very modern with a coffee machine, a stunning view and a massive balcony, beds are very comfy after long days walking round New York you need it.  Everyone is very helpful in the hotel if you need directions etc....  we only used tic rock restaurant for breakfast but can highly recommend.  The hotel is in a great location, penn street station is located round the corner and easy and cheap to use. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.;5
Entering the hotel you immediately walk into an Art Deco lobby where you are greeted warmly by various people. Check in itself was easy and informative.  Our room was a decent size up on the 27th floor offering incredible views. The room was clean and well looked after daily.  We enjoyed breakfasts at the Tick Tock Diner (also excellent !) and the hotel was in easy reach of all the sights (or transport to them).  Would definitely recommend !;4
perfect location for visiting.  Tick tock diner right in hotel.  rooms very small, very small..outdated rooms and bathrooms, but this is a very old hotel.  The location was perfect for our tip, right next to Penn station and w/I walking distance to all midtown manhattan stuff.  Hotel staff friendly and helpful;5
"Corner of 8th Ave and West 34th Street, access to all subways, within walking distance of everything; Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, Empire State Building, 42nd Strret, Theater District, Restaurant Row, Off Broadway Shows, Koreatown, Penn Station, and more!  Easy subway ride to Little Italy and Chinatown.   Hotel is a landmark, being over 100 years old. Rooms are small, have been updated and are nicely decorated. Great views for my room on the 28th floor. Hotel has a rooftop bar which overlooks Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Rooftop bar was closed for renovations when I was there and will reopen in the spring. Add the rooftop bar to the list of a very New York experience. The New Yorker Hotel lobby area is quite impressive and is elegantly";4
Stayed here for a four night city break and we were totally impressed. The room was a metro small room but more an adequate for two of us. The service charge was a bit of a disappointment considering we only used the room as a basis and were not intending to use any facilities. No coffee or tea making facilities in the room, again should be with the service charge. A small problem with the smell of smoke from another residents room, however reception staff quickly responded and issue resolved. The hotel is a little tired but nothing serious. Staff very help and security very good. Tick tock restaurant good value and again helpful staff. Hotel excellent location very near the train station. On the whole would recommend and stay again.;4
We stayed here in January and the hotel is in a fabulous  location. The rooms are small which is  what you  expect in a large city however the  hotels is looking a little tired. The rooms need to be redecorated along with the corridors. The plumbing is noisy and you can here when the people in the next room have a shower or use the  bathroom. The rooms are spotlessly clean, but we bad to ask for a coffee  maker. My biggest gripe was the facility  charge that you have to pay on top of the room charge a which was $31.57 per night. This is for the gym, wi fi and phone calls. This was on top of a refundable deposit of $45 per night. The other charges that you have to pay is if you check out and want to leave your luggage you are charged $2.00 per case. Would I stay here again no.;3
What a delight this hotel is. Steeped in history, all of which is proudly preserved, whether within the elegance of the hotel or in its small museum downstairs. It holds many stories within its walls. The staff are delightful at all times. Check in was fast and proficient  Yes the room (a queen) was quite small but really not that bad, everything needed was there. Only a coffee machine lacking and housekeeping bought one up immediately on request Our only problem was, when we went for our pm showers we couldn’t get any hot water through. Rang reception. Immediately sent an engineer,  but before he could look into the matter reception called to say they were upgrading us. So off we went. Not quite sure about the supposed $100 more per night the new room should be costing. It was;4
Hotel was quick to get to from Newark Airport. We upgraded to a suite which was no trouble for the staff. All staff were friendly and went out their way to help.  Great location opposite Madison Square Garden and close to Penn Station. Our suite was on level 30 and from the lounge we could see the  Empire State Building. Room was clean and lounge and bedroom had individual temperature controls. Only gripe was that we booked bed and breakfast and breakfast was only a juice, coffee and a croissant or similar pastry.  If we’d been told this by our travel agent we’d have gone room only. However the tick tick diner did take a reduction for our more substantial breakfast using the breakfast coupons. That was the only gripe about the hotel. Very busy city and we fitted lots in. Next;5
Great location and lobby staff. Kindly upgraded us due to a birthday. But problems with the most important thing: wasn’t clean. Visible dust/dirt layers on tops of tile, baseboards, bathroom light, debris on floor found when opened curtains.  Housekeeping didn’t come to clean the room first day. Linens were clean though. A clean room is standard and mandatory as far as I am concerned. Seems like a management problem.;2
The hotel staff were awesome from the front desk, housekeeping and security staff. Room was big for NYC although a little older but very clean and well appointed. Wonderful lobby area with old NYC charm. Met some nice guests waiting on taxi or Uber... Doorman was great. Food at Tick Tock was very good. Room service used the typical NYC delivery service and didn't charge huge room service fee. Price was great even when booking directly through hotel.;5
We were in town for just one night for a show at the Lincoln center. We were met with a friendly staff and promptly checked in. Room was clean and as described on the booking site. Again hotel staff was friendly and professional. This was great stay and I would recommend to family and friends.;5
"Great hotel, elegant main lobby and reception area, historic 100 year old hotel is somewhat dated, however stiill nicely appointed; small rooms with most having great views, corner of 8th Ave & W 34th St, centrally located to Times Square, Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree and Ice Rink, Radio City Music Hall, Theatre District and Off-Broadway, Restaurant Row, Macy’s (the world’s largest store), which has the Big Piano from the 1988 movie “Big” starring Tom Hanks;, elegant shopping along 5th Ave., Koreatown, etc.  Within walking district of everything and access to all subways, just a few stops to Little Italy, Chinatown and Canal Street.";4
Most will find the rooms uncomfortably cramped.  That is both the standard rooms and the upgraded superiors.  We were upgraded because of a hot water problem in our room, and although the bathroom was nicer, with a walk-in shower, nothing else was different. It actually seemed to be a slightly smaller room because of the slightly bigger bathroom! We could not find space to store our suitcases. Aside from that it’s a lovely hotel with great staff, a museum in the basement, and efficient lifts.  The whole hotel oozes history and character, and the decor is a slightly understated Art Deco.  Conveniently positioned next to Penn 34th and 8th Av subway.  I’d stay again, but with less luggage!;4
We originally came to NY for college auditions and needed a hotel near the audition Studios. The New Yorker was right across the street from Pearl Studios and Ripley Grier Studios which was ideal for early morning call times. When we arrived I had no clue how many nearby conveniences there actually were. Macy’s was literally minutes walking distance up 34th Street along with many other stores, restaurants, theaters, Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station, Subways, Grand Central Station and Times Square. We walked everywhere! The only time we used the subway is when we went to the Bronx and a taxi to and from the airport. Best NY Trip ever!;5
On Sunday evening we had tickets to a show at Madison Square Garden. We're only a 45 min train ride into NYC but the weather forecast was for snow, ice & frigid temps. Thought it would be a great idea to stay overnight & family members agreed. I wanted the closest hotel to Penn station & MSG which would have reasonable rates as  well as clean rooms, etc. Went online for prices & couldn't believe how low the pricing was especially for a city hotel. I read enough reviews to reserve 2 rooms. Well, our experience was very pleasant! Check-in line went quickly as they had five people behind the desk. Everyone was super nice. They had accommodated my request (prior to checking in) to having our rooms situated in near proximity. Our rooms were totally refurbished with new mattresses,;4
The hotel is old so the elevators take a while. The room is small but the view is sensational! Bathroom needs a makeover, old shower and wets the entire bathroom! The receptionists are excellent and very well educated! The hotel has an excellent location! I recommend;4
We have stayed at the New Yorker a few times and we love it.  The receptionist, Samira, offers excellent service an is always very friendly.  The room we stayed in had great views.  The location is close to Penn station, Times square, Empire state building, the High Line and many other New York sights. Macys is just around the corner.  There are many restaurants close too.;5
As a first timer in New York, The New Yorker provided a wonderful experience. Such an iconic hotel. Had a great view of the Empire State building. The close proximity (30 seconds) to the subway station was a big help.;5
I have visited this hotel 4 times now and it never disappoints. The location is fabulous the hotel is warm, friendly and just what you need for a break in the big apple. The rooms are comfortable and very clean and are of a great standard. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting and exploring this great city;5
Very well located and connected, with helpful staff and enhanced security measures. Though, for a 4 stars hotel, I would have liked to have a breakfast option not only at the restaurant, but included, or at least a minibar in the room. Also, in my room (? double queen with a view) the closet was extremely small and the wall mounted safe in the closet made extremely difficult to use even for one person in the room. In the area there are cheaper offers with more room amenities. Here you pay for the history of the place, glorious past indeed.;3
Lovely hotel mohammed checked us in was very helpful great room and service, all round highly recommended very clean and tidy and central to attractions will definitely return....... Thankyou mohammed for making our stay great from Lucy and David. Uk;5
Staying in room 2621. Minute double, dated and noisy with paper thin walls. You pay a mandatory 22 dollars per room per day service charge extra for free wifi , telephone calls and conference facilities that nobody uses or has on their phone anyway. RIP off and certainly not recommended. No view. , The hotel location is convenient but then, so are many others.;2
We have just returned from a 5 night stay here. Other travellers have already commented on the hotel being a bit dated and that is true. Others have complained about brown water coming from the hot tap, we also experienced that. We did experience delay at check in (almost 2 hours) and the room we were originally given (2701) was near the elevator shafts so noisy. However we left with a very positive feel for the hotel. Others have commented on the location and we could not agree more- excellent. Others have commented on customer service. I have to say that this was excellent. Because we were delayed on check in. they upgraded our room and gave us a drinks voucher for the adjoining Tick Tock or Trattoria restaurants. Upon receiving the complaint about room 2701, they agreed to;4
Glad it was only a two night stay, would not like to stay ant longer in the mouse hole bedroom. Charged for amenities not used. Would definitely not recommend this hotel. Lovely reception area all downhill from there.;1
Visited New York for my wife's 30th birthday in December, i chose the New Yorker due to its location close to Times Square and glad i did. when we arrived checking in didn't take too long, when we got to the room it looked a little tired and could have been cleaner but after a 20 hour trip with our two year old it wasn't the worst thing that we could have been met with.  The hotel is in a great location with the Empire State and Madison Square Garden on the door step, Times Square is about a 10 minute walk give or take depending on traffic and pedestrians.  We visited the Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel and was disappointed, slow service and the food wasn't great either, we had much better food elsewhere while we were there.  We enjoyed it, would definitely stay there;4
I’m sure The New Yorker was a grand old dame in its hey day but it feels very tired today.  Heating in rooms was very ordinary - it was either full blast hot (which made sleeping tricky) or cold.  Shower wasn’t great and the rooms are very small.  The staff were pleasant enough and the room rate was ok but just an average experience overall.;3
Stayed at the New Yorker Hotel for 5 night's with my wife after New Year.   The hotel is in a fantastic location, right next to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. It's also a stone's throw away from The Empire State Building and Times Square.   As for the hotel it's pretty good, its very big lots of rooms and lots of lifts. Staff were friendly despite some of the reviews on here. Room not the biggest but it was ok for what we were looking for, good shower and had hot water everyday. Room was clean, the maids cleaned, replaced towels and made the bed everyday. All in all a great stay would recommend.;4
We visited New York for the first time over NYE 2019. We had an amazing stay and the New Yorker provided a clean and calm retreat from the hustle and bustle. Our room was large by New York standards and older but always clean. The Tic tock diner downstairs was a godsend with delicious, reasonably priced food at our fingertips 24hrs a day. We always felt very safe and cared for at the New Yorker, The location cannot be beaten! The only one thing it was missing was a guest laundry-which meant I had to drag our laundry around the block to wash (we were away for 4 weeks). Overall I would highly recommend...we will definitely return!;5
If you want the real New York this is your hotel. Right in the middle of the action walking distance to Times Square the Empire State Building and most important Macys😀 couldn’t of asked for a nicer hotel and more helpful staff. Rooms were beautiful and clean beds were huge to collapse into after a day of touring. I am always recommending people to stay here and we will definitely be staying on our next trip 😃;5
Spent our honeymoon at the New Yorker, check in was pretty easy and all very friendly I did e-mail in advance to see if they could do anything as it’s our honeymoon unfortunately they couldn’t but we were promised a bottle of wine when we checked in and was told this would be in the room in 10 mins, it never turned up. The hotel is dated and in need of a refurb, the room was on the small side and walls quite thin but kept very clean by the maid. The staff were friendly apart from one desk by reception that kept saying they had a free gift for us and asked every time we went past. The hotel is in a great location for sightseeing. Disappointed with the honeymoon bit but overall I think we would go back again.;4
Stayed at this hotel again excellent friendly service throughout will stay again great position as well with there own restaurants in the building. Trattoria with there varied menu from pizza to steaks tick rock diner with it's great breakfast menu open 24/7 and the service is great but make sure your hungry when going there also try the orio and cream shakes there to doe for.;5
Great hotel.  security by way of hotel card upon registration. You are not able to get on any of the elevators before showing this registation card that you are staying at this hotel.  Our son from Manhattan came to visit and us and the security people verified with us by a phone call that it was o.k. for him to get up to our room.   Most everyone was very cordial and pleasant to be around.  The rooms were very clean and good service for any extras we needed.;5
Yes the basic rooms aren't massive but if your going to New York to sit in the room you have an issue a hotel room is somewhere to sleep.  The room was clean and bed comfortable. All staff friendly and welcoming.   The hotel is in a great location, across from Maddison Square Garden down the road from the Empire state. Times Square, central park, Broadway all walking distance.   Subway outside the door if you don't fancy walking.  Great hotel;5
This was a great location. I was surprised at the smaller size of the rooms, but it may be normal for NYC.  24/7 Diner was great as well. The hotel staff were incredibly polite and friendly. Also, very clean.;3
Have just got back from a 3 night stay at the Wyndham New Yorker. Check in was great, staff were friendly. The room was OK you have to remember this is an old hotel and they have tried to modernise where possible. The room was not the biggest but if you were on a city break like us it is just somewhere to lay your head for some sleep. It was clean the water was hot, pressure was great and the heating worked! Had a clock with 2 USB points which was really helpful. I contacted the hotel ahead of our arrival as we required a fridge for medical reasons. We checked in and the fridge arrived within minutes and was at no additional cost - great!  We used the tic toc diner one morning for breakfast and also ate at Butcher & Banker which were both lovely.  We used the train from the;5
I have  mixed feelings about this hotel !! The hotel itself is very nice ! Old , could use renovation but very clean , and had a welcoming feeling all the times while there ( from bellmen , housekeeping), and overall I great feeling in the hotel  Location is awesome ! Housekeeping was awesome . I called for extra coffee in room since I forgot the “ Come back later “ sign on the door and our coffee did t get refilled . They were there with them shortly and very nice about it !  Now the check in is a way different story !! I requested an early check in if possible . ( I work in business and know it’s not always possible but we make our best for our guests !)  Got to the hotel at 10:30 to find out that our requested suite is not going to be available before the earliest 6 pm;3
A legendary hotel in which all the equipment is really old and used. We have repeatedly received bad information from the hotel staff at the reception desk about the reward program and eventually did not send us all the points we were entitled to according to the staff regulations. There is one version of the reward program at the pay desk. Then, by email, this information does not apply and the money paid for the accommodation can not be accepted for credit points. There was odor in Tesla's basement. The best experience was with cleaning and concierge, which really helped us organize the program.;3
Booked this well known hotel for its position, convenience to Penn Station and accessibility to the sights.  Arrived at the hotel at around 2.00 pm, we were third in the queue.  We were seen by Mohammed, who advised  we were unable to access our room until 4 pm. Whilst we were sorting out the hand luggage to leave in storage, we were pleasantly surprised that Mohammed was able to issue a room there and then, which was great. Initially we were given a room on 27th floor, that was not really big enough to move around with 4 large suitcases. We returned to the desk and saw Mohammed again and asked whether we could possibly move to another room, if we came back after 4 pm, once others had check-in.  He explained that the hotel was very old, and like London, the rooms can be small.;4
I would just like to thank the hotel, especially Neida for the telephone help I received prior to my daughter trip to New York. Information about transportation for the airport was precise easily understood. Thank you;5
Really enjoyed staying again at the New Yorker my favorite place to stay in New York. It is far enough from Times Square that’s its not too busy but close enough to everything within walking distance to Broadway Shows and right by Penn Station . A great view from our room!;5
Stayed for one night in November 2018 (reservation was for two nights).  I booked this hotel because of its convenient location to Penn Station and decent rate.  In this case, I learned I was really getting what I paid for.  When I checked in, another guest was checking out and complaining about brown water coming out of the faucet.  My room seemed well appointed, although I found a window that was letting cold air in and would not shut.  Maintenance came and fixed this problem.    In the morning, I turned on the shower, hopped in, and noticed brown water flowing down my body (I wasn't that dirty).  Same problem with the sink (see attached photo).  The hotel offered me another room, which I probably would have accepted had it not been for another guest complaining of the same;2
I really liked how they’ve kept and maintained the Art Deco style. The hotel is nearly 100 years old, so of course some wear and tear but in all in ok shape.  Small room but comfy beds and good cleaning, quite thin walls though - you heard a lot of what the neighbors did.  The location is awesome, just 5 minutes walk from Madison Square Garden.  Would definitely come again and can recommend friends and family as well!;4
I liked the style of this hotel and the friendly staff. The only thing that was annoying was the cold stream of air at the floor of my room. Had to wear winter shoes all the time when not in bed. While in bed, I kept my socks on. As others noted, the shower is hard to adjust (temperature, stream).;4
This place maybe is not the most luxury in Manhattan, but it has excellent location, next to the Penn Station, and no more than 1 mile of the most important places to visit in Manhattan,the service is pretty good and the view from some kind of rooms are beautiful. Also they have restaurant with good prices. The hotel was  constructed art deco style that's mean you can enjoy the same style that Empire State Building I will return and I do recommend this hotel.;5
the ladies on the desk were very helpful.The Tick Tock  Diner was awesome every time.Excellent location right beside the subway and times square couldn't pick a better location .would definitely recommend this hotel;4
I have received spam calls from Wyndham resorts as a result of my having stayed at The New Yorker. I think people should know that staying at The New Yorker can result in annoying future phone calls trying to sell you a Wyndham vacation.;1
Not a bad hotel but not great... rather tired and in need of refurbishment throughout. Definitely not 4 star, more like 3 in my opinion. Concierge non existent and no real in room service. Great location though and reception staff great. Had to change room as first one was awful but did without any issues. If you are looking for location and great rates then this the place for you, however if you are looking for luxury then look elsewhere. Overall not to bad.;3
This hotel is not recommended at all.   Those guys at the reception have an attitude problem. They locked us out of the room and authorized the credit card without notifying us, claiming that they left us a message in the room (which we weren’t allowed to enter anyways).   His argument was you haven’t stayed in a hotel in the US before and you don’t know the protocol. This comment is extremely offensive from a guest service manager and in our case is not true. That’s our 4th or 5th hotel in the US and the WORST of all by far !;1
Great location - food options, public transportation, sights, and entertainment are all a short walk away. Nice fitness center - surprisingly large for any hotel, especially one in NYC. Accommodating staff - helpful when you need them. Have stayed at this property at least a half-dozen times and will undoubtedly be back here again in the future.;4
Our rooms were great And large for New York. The service was excellent.  The subway was right across the street and cabs were always available.  I would highly recommend choosing this hotel. I will stay on again on our next trip to New York.;5
I’ve never written a review on TripAdvisor but I felt compelled to do so after my recent stay at this hotel. I don’t care about how modern or hip or whatever bells and whistles most people care about. Location and view are more important for me. I usually spend very little time in my room anyways.   My kid has never been to NYC and my wife has never stayed in NYC. So I wanted a “Wow” factor. Mission accomplished! I got a queen suite with a view room. Which was not all that expensive. Had no idea I was going to get a corner room with Balcony that was bigger than the room. Not only that, but we could see the Empire State Building, Chrysler building, and MSG all from our room and balcony. This saved us a lot of money. We had planned on going up the Empire State Building and top of;5
Room size was horrible maybe 12 X 12. Shower leak all night, made housekeeping aware of the problem was never corrected.  Vanity space maybe 5 or 6 inch  very very tiny bathroom.  Horrible for the price that was paid over $500.00 New Years weekend.  will never stay at this place again. really deceiving  lobby is elegant;1
We got a great price although our room was tiny. However, new bathroom bathrobe and coffee which not all room have.  Elevators were always quick and wireless was fine.  Perfect location and easy block from Penn Station.  No wait for cabs on that long line    Highly recommend.;4
Perfect location within walking distance of penn station, shops and Times Square.  Hotel could do with a bit of updating but think it was just the style of hotel. Small rooms but perfecting fine as don’t spend a lot of time in room, water was lovely but bath was grubby.;5
It was our first time in NYC and we found that The New Yorker met our needs for our 3 night stay.   Pros: It is directly across the street from Penn Station which made it easy to take the train to/from JFK and Newark Airports. It is also walking distance to a ton of tourists attractions, as well as a straight shot 15-ish minutes to lower Manhattan via the subway. Our room had a “metro” view from the 25th floor which was perfect. We could clearly see the Hudson River and a wide view of the surrounding buildings below and across from us. The staff was friendly and accommodating.   Cons: The hotel could use some cosmetic upgrades - in the room bathrooms specifically. The bathtub was stained and looked dirty. I wiped it down thinking it hadn’t been cleaned, but turns out it just had;4
Perfect location, staff brilliant and friendly, nice easy and very helpful check in. Rooms need a decor/facility improvement but shower was perfect. Its New York all you do is sleep in the hotel and the beds were great and comfy. Don't think we will stay anywhere else when we return.;5
"Love the New Yorker Hotel, perfectly located next to Time Square, Madison Square Gardens, Shopping & Restaurants. If you need 2 beds in your room; I recommend getting a  Queen Suite which are double the size of a room with just 2 beds. The Queen Suits has one bedroom and has a separate room with a pull out sofa bed with very comfortable mattress.The rooms with 2 bed are very small and not much cheaper than the Queen Suites , it will be  worth paying the small difference.";5
Overall the hotel check-in process was quite easy. Myself and 5 others had a suite for the evening and there was plenty of space for us all. A little dated throughout the building but to be about .5 miles from Times Square, not bad.;4
"My wife and I (mid 50's) just got back from a 3 day stay at the New Yorker.  The rooms are pretty small (we had the standard room, double bed) but very clean and more than adequate.  Staff was very friendly.  Location could not be better since we Amtrak in to Penn Station.  I was originally going to deduct a star from this hotel because of the ""resort fee"" that's imposed which, let's be honest, is a money grab that most NYC hotels are using now.  But my wife and I politely inquired about it at check-in and asked if there was any way to reduce it... and they did.  I was pleased.";5
Small tight rooms, staff at reception lack knowledge, The concierge Desk had an older fella who was extremely rude to both my wife and my daughters mother in law.  I did not believe it so listened in and found him so rude.  The Diner on corner was great top service and friendly.  Rooms were clean, very small bathroom and it needed attention. Would I stay here again ?  Yes, but NY is over rated noisy sirens every night.  Plenty to do though.;3
There's nothing quite the location of this hotel. While the amenities are a bit worn down (showers are old, elevators are slow), everything is just near this one -- a stone's throw away from convenience stores, a subway stop, and a few blocks away from Times Square. If you get a room of a high floor, as well, you'll be given such an amazing view.;4
This is our second time at the Wyndham.  I book a suite queen which give us some extra room.  The coffee maker is a nice addition.  The lobby is lovely and the Tic Toc Restaurant next door  has delicious food.;4
You cannot beat the location!  Its on a major subway line and across the street from Penn Station.  We stayed for three days in early November for our anniversary (during the marathon weekend) and it was a bit steep in price ($1,000 for three nights) for a very very small room given the overall condition of the hotel.  The first morning we did not have hot water, and the second day the hot water was so hot that we could not adjust it to get it warm...it was either scalding or cold!  What's with that?  Also, we had a pair of pants missing that was hanging in the closet!  In the morning they were there, in the afternoon when we got back they were gone!  What's with that?  It is an old hotel so we did not expect it to be pristine, but overall it was kept up for the most part.  It;3
Stayed only one night as a last minute treat visit to NYC. Loved the deco fixtures and fittings in the room and the decor of the hotel. Staff very friendly and it is worth paying for a room with a view of the skyline. Only downside the rooms are small and no Mr Coffee machine. Would stay there again!;4
Place was amazing, staff was friendly, had great bars downstairs. Lovely views of the city and they cater to families. Also room service is no charge and very fast. The New Yorker Suite with Empire State View was phenomenal and you could see the entire city and the sunset was to die for every morning of our stay. Housekeeping was friendly and also took care of our children providing us with extra waters and cokes in our fridge daily. Walking distance to the Empire State Building, Times Square and Madison Square Garden. If you need a cab the bellhop will whistle one for you or just use Uber and they’ll pick you up directly from the hotel. We all Loved this place.;5
We stayed in a very nice room - renovated - no view really from room but appreciated the coffee and waters supplied daily - restaurant in the hotel was tasty as well - we would definitely stay here again if we visit;4
Firstly, the location of this place is great. And that’s where the positive comments end. Upon arrival we were greeted by a receptionist with an awful attitude problem. The hotel was booked for 5 people, however we were only given a room with 2 double beds.. when we asked the receptionist to sort this out, she went on to blame Booking.com for the error, stating it was their fault and we should contact them. Sorry but this hotel is trusting Booking.com to make bookings on their behalf, therefore it’s up to the hotel to resolve any issues.  The room was spacious however very poorly maintained (see attached photo). There was rust leaking down the wall into the bath (disgusting). The room cleaner must notice this every day when cleaning the bath but still no one has been sent out to;1
Stayed 5 nights and was happy enough, asked for a larger room at check in which they gave us on the second day and was much better. Room 3204 on 39th floor, ask for it as it has a superb view. From the airport get the train as hotel is literally a 5 minute walk from Penn Station, staff are polite and helpful, lifts are reliable and there is minimal waiting, i have seen complaints on here about staff being rude this is not the case in my experience. Only ate at the on site diner once and it was ok but New York is about exploring so for me you eat different places every day. I would stay here again but as for the resort fee which we all hate paying, a note to the management, this should include luggage storage as charging 2 dollars per item is not fair at all.;4
The New Yorker Wyndham Hotel is a wonderful place to stay. Entering NYC is located steps from Penn Station. Staff are great in attending to any of your needs. You are stepping into history with the hotel. Rooms are laid out from an overnight stay for one or enjoyment of a suite. The room is clean and housekeeping maintains your room in a perfect condition.;5
An adequate cosy room for the situation in central New York.  Very convenient to Penn Station and underground.  Good breakfast facilities with excellent prompt service and choices.  Felt ripped off at daily $25 levy for wi-fi and health centre. I thought racketeering went out with prohibition but it seems standard in most New York Hotels. Helpful and friendly staff and well situated for Empire State, shops including Macys and broadway.;4
The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is walking distance to almost everything. We stayed 11 nights. The rooms are small, there is no space to open the suitcase and wardrobe is very, very small so you have to keep some of your clothes in the suitcase. The rooms are not very clean. When we came we found a hair in the bathtub. The worst thing about this hotel is staff in the lobby. They are so rude and not helpfull at all. In the lobby you can buy coffee and pastries. Coffee is 5 dollars.  So you can have breakfast in the lobby. On the ground floor there is a Tick Tock restaurant, don’t go there. Across the street is Starbucks and McDonald’s. The taxi from JFK to the hotel is flat rate 52 $ plus tip. Penn station is 1 minute from the hotel, so you can use public;3
Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights, excellent service, staff, the room was on the 31st floor, no long wait at the elevator, everything was available for me, even the door man was very help in getting a taxi for me.;5
"Travelled here over the Xmas period. The hotel lobby was nice but the rest of the hotel felt very dated and could do with a lot of TLC. The room itself was pretty small and the bathroom laid out very awkwardly. TV was meant to have ""Premium Channels"" but there was not a lot to choose from and the quality was fuzzy. 2 out of the 4 nights we stayed our room wasn't cleaned despite leaving a 'Please Clean' note on the door which was very annoying. We'd payed extra to have a room with a view. The room was on a higher floor but the view was disappointing. Looked on to a building in front of us and dirty balcony below, if you looked far to you right you could see the Hudson river through some buildings. So definitely wasn't worth the extra month.  The heating was very noisy so had to";2
The New Yorker has an impressive lobby full of helpful people. We had a room that overlooked the Empire State Building. It had 2 double beds, a desk, and a small dresser. It's smaller than most hotel rooms I've stayed in but location is important here. The bathroom is small with very little space to put your things like make up down on, but there is a small ledge. The Tick Tock Diner is downstairs. They are always open and have good food for breakfast.;4
This hotel is in a great location. We stayed a week and with 2 kids our room was a little small for us as was the bathroom. The shower was hot and did fluctuate often, but you get that with older buildings. Check in was easy, the security at the lift was constant. The staff were helpful each time I needed them. We hired a fridge for our room which was brought up promptly & was perfect for our milk etc for kids. Servicing was up to standard. The Tick Tock diner was great with great food. We had a view of W35th St from the 35th floor.   Our stay was pleasant.;4
Location location location.  I’ve been in NYC a few times and stayed in different areas.. This time on 34th and 40th... ( yes Miracle on 34th St). 2 blocks from Macy’s and literally across the road from Madison Sq. Garden. There’s a McDs , Pizza Deli, Dunkin Donuts and plenty of other eateries across the road and plenty to choose from on 8th Avenue... the lobby is iconic and the staff very friendly with good security... rooms are small but functional and for all the time you spend in them, ok.. clean but by no means luxurious .. good views but I would not recommend “tick tock” the adjoining diner .. 34 dollars for I plate of pancakes and 3 coffees ! Let the hotel down in my opinion as vastly overpriced .. about 15-20 mins to Times Sq.. Great for location but would recommend;4
Stayed for 6 nights in a 2 room suite with a brilliant view along 34th st over MSG and with great views of the Empire State and Chrysler building. Big and busy hotel but organised staff and very visible security (need to show card to get to lifts). Tick Tock diner excellent and great bar/restaurant in old bank vault underneath the hotel - dont miss it. Location brilliant - subway adjacent and walk to all major attractions.  Cons - small bathroom. A great place to stay in NYC;5
The New Yorker Wyndham Hotel is located in a central location in the hub bub of Manhattan.  The Tick Tock dinner is located off the lobby with excellent service and food 24/7! The Theater District,  Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, Javitts Convention Center, Empire State Building are all within easy walking distance, pus a subway stop is right outside the hotel.  The hotel itself is very clean and the staff quite friendly.  Security personnel are in service all day and night giving guests a secure and sound night's sleep in NYC.  The New Yorker Wyndham is our #1 choice when visiting the Big Apple!;5
"Great place for events near all the fun places in New York. Madison Square Gardens, Times Square. You can take the Subway; that is right outside the Hotel anywhere you would like to go. There is a 24 hour restaurant in the hotel called Tick Tock with great pricing. There is an unlimited amount of shops and food places right outside the doors. There is a coffee place in the hotel and a Starbucks, McDonalds & CVS store across the street. Big Hotel 40 floors with plenty of elevators and great Security. Very safe place to stay.";5
"The title of my review really says most of what I wanted to express. The New Yorker is an Iconic Manhattan hotel; I would be disappointed at having to stay anywhere else (except maybe the Waldorf Astoria).   The thing that makes this hotel so appealing is it's history and design. It is a hotel for the people, at very affordable prices, but with service and pedigree second to none.   Please do your research before you stay here, and understand how significant this place is. It's an art-deco masterpiece, with rooms dedicated to the geniuses Muhammad Ali and Nikola Tesla, who both stayed at this hotel, Ali ti recuperate after his fight with Frazier at Madison Square Garden (just across the street on the corner of 34th), and Tesla, who lived in room 3327 for ten years until he died";5
I had read reviews of this hotel before I went but I cannot fault my stay. Got a Queen room with no view. The room was very clean, although not the upgraded ones everything worked and was fine for our stay.  We were there for a week and it was a great location, just over the road from Penn Station, Maddison Square Gardens and within easy walking distance of many major attractions. I would stay there again.;5
Firstly, this is not a cheap hotel. It's one of the most famous in New York so of course it isn't, but it is a very good hotel. Once we had moved rooms (the first one was the size of a stamp and had the view from a mail box) my mum and I had a spacious room with two big beds, large bathroom, very powerful shower and a nice view looking west. The New Yorker is in a good location for most of Manhattan, check in was easy (although check out was done by an extremely miserable lady), the small museum downstairs is worth seeing for a few minutes and the building itself is a beautiful art deco construction. Downsides? A few. The wardrobe (closest) in our room, 3039, didn't have a light in it which is moronic, and the bathroom door handle on the inside has to be pushed about 150 degrees;4
The NewYorker is situated beside Madison Square gardens a stones throw from Times Square. We were warned before we went that nyc hotel rooms are small and yes they are but as you are just sleeping there it really wasnt an issue. The check in process was seamless, great security, helpful staff, nice bar. Happily recommend this place if you are in nyc;4
Really nice stay in NYC.  Hotel was great. Location is excellent. Penn Station across the street we used to go to Newark for a hockey game. Plenty to do close by like Empire state building, Macy's,  Highline etc. Short walk to Times Square. Ate twice at tick tock dinner located in hotel. Was very good and a decent price by NYC standards. Staff was very friendly and helpful esp during New Years Eve weekend;5
I was very comfortable in my room. Bed was clean and comfortable, and the shower had good water pressure and hot water. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is also in an excellent location, and there are several options for food and drink in the same building.;5
"I stayed there for about 2 weeks. On the first night i had a very small room with no view (or on a wall...) because the hotel was fully booked, after that i could change for another room. That made a whole difference, the room was bigger, nicer, and with a beautifull view... The only thing i didn't like was the carpet everywhere like in many American hotels... The staff was professionnal and friendly. It's a hotel with a history, Nicola Tesla leaved there for about 10 years ! It's very well located on the 8th Avenue, next to Pen Station, very practical to reach the airport via the train. I really liked the fitness room ! Actually i have chosen this hotel because of it's nice and big fitness room. It has all (or almost all ;-)) the equipment you might need. It's opened 24h a day,";5
Visited NYC & stayed at the New Yorker. Good location. Staff not keyed up on trips and not very helpful in general.   Tick Tock service was poor & all they seemed interested in was Tips.   Wi Fi is free whilst you are checked in but as soon as you check out this is cancelled despite having to wait all afternoon for your transport to the airport.;3
Stayed here for 4 nights.rooms are small but the bed and shower were perfect.room had a good view and also had a safe which is handy.no tea/coffee facilities but there is a small coffee shop in the lobby.excellent location and right next to penn station.ideal for getting in and out from the airport.;4
We stayed here for 10 days. Upon check in it started great with our room being available early. The first night we had luke warm hot water which we asked management to check for us. This was a big debacle and they kept thinking we were talking about the heater and continually asked about the thermostat. Eventually the next night it was fixed but it was still not hot. Had to have a shower with no cold water and after a full day in a new york winter we wanted a HOT shower. Honestly wasnt much of a problem though.  Few days later our room stunk of marijuana. Someone was smoking in their room and was sucked through the ventilation and dumped into our room being that it was last on the half way. When we rang management the guy on the phone was rude but we asked someone to be sent up;4
I have to admit the location is brilliant 10mins from times square and 20 mins from central park.  Short 1hour walk will take you downtown. Upon arrival at the hotel you will be charged a service charge which is 22 dollers per day ! Along with a whopping 175doller charge for your stay depending how long you are there.  After your stay advised they will refund you the money and send a receipt.  It has been 1 week since we have arrived back to the UK iv had no receipt I did get my refund but then they have taken it back of me so I am still out of pocket by £135 (currency change) I have emailed them and had no responce my only option is to review for a responce!! Not a happy customer considering I paid nearly £2000  for my trip to new york.;1
Currently staying at this hotel and would not recommend to anyone.  The rooms are tiny and very dirty. Myself and partner( who has asthma) are very irritated by the dust in the room. We expected a small room but there is nowhere to put your clothes apart from a disgusting set of drawers and tiny cupboard which I wouldn’t dream of putting my belongings in.  The maids are extremely rude! with the amount of noise they make. They were talking very loudly outside our room at 8.30am this morning. We aren’t usually long sleepers but we had an early start the day before and were hoping to sleep a little later this morning.   Currently one maid is cleaning out a room next to us after a couple have moved out. It’s after 9pm at night and the noise is EXTREMELY irritating as she is in and;1
Fantastic location. We came here on our honeymoon and was a lovely hotel. Slightly disappointed with the room, bathroom had no heating so was freezing. Staff very pleasant. Would book to stay here again but maybe upgrade our room.;4
I did not hesitate to stay here again when returning to NYC, and my friends enjoyed their stay here. A beautiful art deco hotel, it has a charm that more modern places lack.The location is excellent. We stayed in an accessible room and had a nice bathroom (as opposed to my last visit). The staff was nice and vigilant. Sadly, I found the beds very hard and uncomfortable, but that's just me. The Tick Tock Diner (connected to the hotel) is okay but not fast. The elevator to access it is not always functional, and that caused some issues. The Butcher and Banker restaurant is not a part of the hotel, despite being located on the property. If you need to reach them, the hotel will not connect you. It was open on Christmas Day, and staying in the hotel area was quite nice. The public;4
Fantastic place to stay, lovely Art Deco hotel with many original features. Paid extra to get up grade to a higher floor and didn’t disappoint with views of Madison square gardens and the Empire State Building. Staff very friendly only disappointment was the hotel diner Tick Tock which was very expensive for the poor quality food it served, and dismissive staff.;5
This hotel is ok, located really good... Not far away from all...  But the room, is not what you see on the pictures, the shower is bad... Some of the furnitures are damaged...  The staff is very friendly...;2
We have previously stayed at this hotel twice before for one week at a time and absolutely loved it. After a long flight- the same as everyone, we couldn’t wait to get into our room and settle. Upon arrival, the room was extremely cold, it felt like a window was wide open when they were all shut. The room was very small, we had previously stayed in a suite for more people so we expected it to be smaller but this was tiny. The “doors” joining the bedroom and the living room were not sufficient and they may as well not have been there. We decided to seek assistance at the check in desk and see what the hotel could offer. We first spoke to Miguel who was very polite and could clearly understand our concerns. He then went to fetch the manager, Jason, who was polite - at first. Jason;1
2nd stay in this hotel 20 years on from my first stay.  Reception/lobby area is always busy with guests loitering around. I liked the security to the lifts.  Lucky enough to get a room on the 23rd floor with a view of the empire state. Tick tock diner was great, but needs more staff in the evening as service could have been quicker.  Location of this hotel is perfect. 5 min walk to the empire state and macys, 20 mins to times square, 30 to central park. You couldn't be better placed if you tried. Plenty of shops and eateries around the area too.  The bathrooms are in desperate need of upgrading, that should be a priority for the Wyndham. They look shoddy and about ready to fall apart. We struggled to keep the floor dry even when aiming the shower head at the wall. This wouldn't;4
"Wouldn't it be nice to book a 5* hotel one day and find everything is as it should be and everything that you hoped for from a 5* hotel?   The positives: - The rooms are a great size and larger than one typically gets in New York hotels. They are as the photos show. - Great location close to 5th Avenue and convenient for theatres etc  The Negatives: - A 5* hotel that still charges for wifi? Really? Room prices are pricey enough so charging additionally just gives a  very poor impression. Very outdated and miserly to charge for wifi. - No free water in the rooms! Same sentiment as the wifi point. - Staff ; surly, and disinterested on both check in and check out. Ignored feedback on checkout. Wasn't my  own experience, but at times during my stay I saw some very long queues for";3
Great hotel in a great location, only issue we had was checking in which was resolved quickly but we found some of the staff were not as polite and  welcoming as they were when we stayed with them before.;4
Excellent location, friendly staff, fast check-in check-out. Spacious double room in 8th floor. Stylish lobby. Walking distance to times square. Many restaurant and coffeeshop around. 24h grocery store in front of the hotel.  Parking is 40USD and 45USD for SUV (for hotel guests) nearby.  Sewage smell was coming all the time from the bathroom during our stay.  Old, small TV. not HD. Limited channels.;3
Large, busy centrally located hotel. Awesome facilities (gym) and tick tick diner nice for breakfast.  Rooms and bathroom are neat and tidy although quite small.  Lovely view of the EPS and surrounding buildings.  Only reason why I didn’t give 5 stars is the hotel was extremely busy while we were there. Long que for elevators (can stop multiple times) check-in, breakfast and luggage storage.  Would stay at the hotel again as very reasonably priced.;4
Easy, friendly check-in. Suite room was a great size for New York. The view from the 40th floor is amazing. We has a clear shot of the Empire State and MSG. Closets were spacious, and the mini Keurig was amazing. Also loved the stocked mini-fridge (water, coke, and diet coke) It was free for the suite. The location made everything easier. Penn Station is a minute walk, Subways are less than five minutes away, and you're already in the heart of Manhattan. Loved this hotel, and would definitely stay here again!;5
Ideal hotel to stay . 5 mins from Time Square & on the junction of 34 st & 8th Ave.  rooms clean & tidy , but a bit of modernisation wouldn’t go amiss.  Plenty of restaurants & bars close by.  Italian restaurant connected to hotel is top quality & reasonably priced. Would stay there again.;5
Had an excellent stay at The New Yorker Hotel, rooms very comfortable with good amenities, staff very helpful & polite, excellent diner one side of the hotel, also a very good Italian restaurant on the other side. Hotel very well located for getting around New York, most attractions can be reached in a slow walk in round 30 minutes. If you don't like walking then there is a subway station located on the corner.;4
The New Yorker is well located and that's why I loved to stay here, and I love Korean food around this hotel there is tons o Koreans restaurants so perfect. The rooms are big enough, and clean, the only downside was when I came off the lifts the floor carpets needed an upgrade, but the rest look well. The staff is helpful;5
This is an amazing historic property. We ended up in the Tesla room, where Nikola Tesla lived and died. I was so honored to be randomly assigned this room. Everything was wonderful expect the water temperature. The shower went from pleasant to scalding and then to freezing. We stayed there for three days and I was honestly too scarred to wash my hair for fear of a severe burn. I mentioned it to the front desk and I was told that the building is very old with very old plumbing and it was common to have inconsistencies in temperature.;2
"Room was small but very efficient for the two of us. Only problem we had, which is usually not a complaint, is getting cold water!!! Location was great - close proximity to Times Square, Subway, and much more. The Tick Tock Diner connected to the hotel is reasonably priced and you get ample food (had lunch and breakfast there). Butcher Banker Steakhouse was one of the best meals we had! Used their driver to get to the airport; he was a good driver and very friendly.";5
My family and I had an amazing stay from 12/19-21. Our room was extremely spacious with 2 beds, 2 closets and a separate sitting area with 2 chairs and a small table. The property was very well maintained and the staff were all wonderful. The location was perfect for sight seeing. We will surely stay at this propyagsin on our next trip to NYC!;5
Second time staying here, and I'd have to say I'd be hard pressed to find a better place to stay when visiting NYC. If you're in town to see a show at the Garden, relax. It'll take you all of 45 seconds to walk to the front doors.  Since most shows don't start exactly at the designated time, you might even want to wait until show time, then head over and miss the long lines as you stroll on in, without a care in the world.   The hotel lobby is beautiful, with friendly professional staff, and solid security checking room keys as you walk by to their huge bank of elevators. Some of the places I've stayed in the city have elevators which proceed at what I'd call a glacial pace. Not these babies. Punch in your floor number, and zooooom- you're flying silently up there at the speed;5
Got room on 39th floor and view from our suite was just amazing. Not too far from Times Square. Just next to Penn Station. Nice staff and the best thing is the Great Nikola Tesla lived in this hotel for almost ten years. Overall the experience at the hotel was awesome.;5
We came in with my sister to celebrate her 70th birthday by attending the Billy Joel concert.  We were upgraded to a gigantic, clean double room on the 31st floor!  We didn't even have to ask.  Kudos to The New Yorker.  Right across the street from Madison Square Garden.;5
It was a great stay until it wasn’t. On the last day of our stay, we requested and paid for valet parking for an extra night while we explored the city so that our car would be in a secure facility. That night, we texted to retrieve our car at 7:47 and when we arrived in the lobby at 7:54 our car was already out front. Seems fast right? Wrong. Turns out our car in it’s ‘secure facility’ had been sitting in the road for more than an hour because they had supposedly had a call about it. But the room number and ticket provided by the valet did not match our ticket, even though it was our car. On top of that, the valet didn’t even initially ask for our ticket, they just handed us keys to the car because we said it was ours. There was nothing to prevent them from giving the keys to;1
From the various hotel stays in NYC this hotel provided me the perfect stay specially because of proximity to hell's kitchen and garment district. Very Safe hotel with 24x7 security. Coffee bar in the lobby.;5
"Wonderful location within short walking distance to Macy's, Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens.  Also drug store across the street and many restaurants near by.  Anywhere from 1 mile to 1 1/2 miles to Times Square, Theatre District and a lot of the sights.  Will definitely stay here again.  A great bargain for the money; and top security.";5
Stayed at Wyndham New Yorker Dec 19th - 22nd. Great classic hotel. Location was wonderful. Staff was outstanding. Would most definitely stay here again. It is very accessible to Penn Station and a subway stop is right outside the doors.;5
We pre-paid for a December NYC trip to see the city at Christmas and attend shows. BIG mistake. We were not allowed to check in until 8:30pm on our arrival day. We kept getting different stories from management about why this was, and one of the excuses was guests doing very late checkouts. (when I inquired about a late checkout on our departure day, they told us it was 1pm which is only an extra hour. so, New Yorker management, how late were these other guests allowed to stay...)It was incredibly inconvenient because we had dinner reservations but no place to change clothes, use the restroom etc. The worst part was that management made NO effort to remedy the situation or compensate us for our trouble. The rooms we were promised were not what was delivered. Not much of a view;1
the only place to stay...being a born n bred new yorker myself there is a high bar that needs to be met to be considered the best...the new yorker fills that requirement above and beyond...and it is the only place i will stay from now on...;5
"The New Yorker Hotel had its heyday in the 1930's.  It was aging when Wyndham bought the hotel and it has been under renovation for the last decade.  Now the rooms are larger and comfortable, simple furnishings.  The bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was small but well appointed.  The lobby is elegant and right now, decorated for the holidays.  there is a connected Italian restaurant on the left and a famous breakfast retaurant, the Tick Tock, on the right.  It's across the street from Madison Square Garden; Penn Station is under the Garden.  At 34th street, you're a few blocks from the Empire State Building.  If you turn left and walk about 12 blocks, you run into Times Square with its many Broadway shows.  It's a great location";4
Remodeled rooms are too small. Older rooms are better but not always having the feel of clean. Can’t beat location if working near Penn Station or mid-town Manhattan. Also, hotel impresses on security.;3
Firstly the positives - the Wyndham New Yorker has a lot of history (there's a small free museum downstairs!) and you can't really beat the location. Literally a stone's throw from Madison Square Garden and 10-15 mins from Empire State Building and Times Square. There are 2 or 3 subway stations nearby which is convenient. Service was also good. Check in was painless and we had an issue with the toilet bring blocked which was sorted very quickly and efficiently. Tick Tock diner next door was awesome, we only ate there once but would recommend it. For the location, we didn't hear any noise during the night etc but I guess this may vary depending on where you're staying in the hotel.  Negatives - the room is tiny. I've heard this is normal for New York, we had a double bed and not;3
Friendly staff and lovely hotel in the heart of of the city, close to all shops and the empire state building also time square was a 10 min walk away. Would say the only down side was there was no drinks facilities in the room but seeing as there are shops everywhere around this was not a problem. We stayed fir 4 nights and iur room was always imaculat when we returned.;5
Beautifully decorated for the holidays, this historic Art Deco hotel with modern conveniences less than two blocks from Penn Station and Macy’s has larger than normal NYC rooms with very comfortable beds, exceptional staff service, a 24 hour retro diner and excellent Italian restaurant.;5
Stayed for 3 nights last week. First off the good points. Hotel central and within walking distance of Penn Station, Macy's, Empire State Building, Times Square and a decent walk to Central Park. Bad Points. On checking in we where given the key cards to a room on the 28th floor (2821), to say we where disappointed would be an under statement. It was the smallest room we have ever stayed in and would have been small for just 1 person with a single bed. It was so small that I had to lift our case over the bed to get it in the wardrobe (see photo). On complaining to reception we where offered a room on the 25th floor for the 2nd and 3rd nights provided we payed an upgrade which we did. This was an improvement but as with the first room it looked as though they needed a fresh coat;2
The New Yorker is in a prime location. We went to NYC to see Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden. The hotel is across the street. It is also steps from Penn Station. The hotel is a historical building and they do a great job highlighting it's history to include an exhibit on the lower level. The staff was warm and friendly. We were able to upgrade our room with a view of the Empire State Building.....magnificent at Christmas! Keep in mind this is a historical building so you have to admire the history and architecture to include the rooms. We loved our stay and always felt safe. The Tick Tock Diner which is in the hotel has a lot to be desired. The staff was rude and abrasive and the food terrible. I would take a walk to The Pig n Whistle which is less than a 5 minute walk from;4
Very historic and beautiful hotel with everything you need onsite. Centrally located in midtown close to everything. Within waking distance to lots of attractions. Restaurant and 24 hour dinner serving good food. We enjoyed our stay very much.;5
Great Hotel, one of the oldest Hotels in NYC with lots of history. In a great location, subway steps away, Macy's down the street and a 10 min walk to Times Square. Very friendly and attentive staff and great service! Check in took a while but it was a very busy time in NYC. Nice spacious lobby with plenty of seating and clean comfortable rooms. Bathrooms were a bit small but very clean and good water pressure with Hot water. Will def be back again. If you didnt get a good view, head up to the 39th floor breakfast area for a quick view of the city/Empire State building.;5
Lovely clean hotel , lovely obliging and helpful staff and first class location, very handy for Time Square, Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens,  the subway and bus station only minutes away if you wanted to go further afield . I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.;5
"Wonderful stay as always! This is my 11th stay at The New Yorker since 2004 and it has vastly improved over the years. The beds are unbelievably comfortable and I actually sleep better there than I do at home! The water pressure in the shower is incredible with all the hot water you could ever ask for. We arrived early this trip and yet our room was ready and waiting for us at 11 AM. Having the 24-hour Tick Tock diner attached to the lobby is just an added perk. The location cannot be beat if you prefer to travel by train; step out of Penn station and the hotel is a block away. It is also in the heart of Midtown, essentially two blocks from Macy’s, three blocks from the Empire State building and just a short walk to Times Square & Radio City/Rockefeller Plaza. The subway is";5
We stayed at the hotel during a recent family trip to New York. The hotel is a step back in time, but also tired and ragged at the edges. Check in was not great, arrived at 8pm and didn’t get all 3 of our rooms till after 10:30pm, suspect this was partly due to us pre- requesting we were all on the same floor. Staff were apologetic and we were given some drink vouchers and credit on the resort fee which was appreciated. Staff at the hotel are friendly including room cleaners, always made to feel welcome. Location of the hotel is great whether you want to go up or down town. We walked pretty much everywhere, but the subway is well located for those who don’t. Tick-Tock diner was great (portions are large) and the staff very friendly, a good breakfast to get you going. Would;3
Great service and location.   We went by train and the hotel was across the street.  We were able to walk to hotel.  The hotel was also in close proximity to Macy's, Time Square, Broadway, etc.We were located right down town.  The security was;5
We planned a trip to New York to experience the Christmas Holiday in New York.  We loved our stay at the New Yorker!  It was central to everything we wanted to do with access to Times Square, Broadway and Rockefeller Center.  The concierge service was stellar!! As were the entire staff.  We were treated like royalty!  Our room was on the 25th floor with a great view of the empire state building.  The room was tight but very clean and well maintained.  I will definitely be staying her on our next trip to New York.;4
This is my second stay in 12 months at this wonderful hotel which is perfectly located a short walk to Penn Station which means transport around the city and to/from the airport is optimal. The rooms are a little outdated and small (standard for NYC) however when visiting NYC I want to experience the sights and sounds of the city and therefore don’t spend much time in my room. However what I do want is a clean, safe and well located property where the staff are friendly and helpful. I also want good options in terms of food/drinks and nearby stores. The New Yorker certainly ticks those boxes. The hotel staff prior to my visit (especially Emily R) were also very accommodating and helpful. I look forward to my next trip! Thank you!;4
The New Yorker is a great hotel. Perfectly located with easy access to Penn Station, the subways and walkable to the theater district, Time Square and Rockefeller Center. Also, Jack Doyle’s is just around the corner on 35th. Plus, the Art-Deco style of the hotel, its little “museum” downstairs, and the Tick-Tock Diner makes for a very entertaining stay.;5
Check in and check out are less then awesome at this property. I’ve been staying her for work as the price is decent, rooms are clean and in all honesty I’m only in the room to sleep. There is a small trattoria off the lobby, food is good and happy hour prices are great. What I will say is that the check in and out kind of sucks. I’ve stayed at this property a few times and it’s the same thing. Only 1-2 people on the desk and a line up to the door. Today a lady felt much more important then everyone and cut the line. When I said something to the employee that the woman should have been sent to the back of the line shoe told me she works for an airline and gets priority... my comment was that’s not right, we are all human and all of our time is important. I too am in tourism and;2
We paid extra for City View and got a corner room with a view, but the size of a walk-in closet. Comfortable bed, clean linens, but old faucets made it hard to regulate heat in shower, either scalding or cold. Adequate closet space, but one torn chair, so heavy and cumbersome it served no purpose. Staff is friendly.;2
"This is my go-to hotel in the City. You can't get better value for money in Midtown Manhattan than at the New Yorker, in my opinion, and I've always felt welcomed and right at home. Staff are all professional and kind; the establishment has an environmentally-friendly approach, rooms are very, very clean, comfortable and well-appointed, requests are handled promptly and cheerfully; the security and concierge staff are discreet, courteous, helpful and reassuring, and that sumptuous lobby is a must-see! This celebrated Art Deco property has a history that adds to the visit. If you want a room with a ""view"", you can ask for one; but even when I haven't asked, I've always enjoyed the views. As everywhere in NYC, rates do vary quite a lot depending on the day of your stay and peak";5
Great hotel, requested a high floor with view, was not disappointed! Could not do early check in because they had been sold out the night before. Based on traveling during Christmas season we were not very surprised that they couldn’t take us early. Left our bags with bell service so we could go explore.;5
Friendly convenient and very clean and comfortable. Great location.  Easy access to train station and theater district. A lot of great attractions and restaurants nearby. Nice in hotel restaurant and bar.;5
It is the second time we stay at the Wyndham NewYorker at we had the best holiday ever. Everything worked, from the tours, the food and THE HOTEL. This time we got a room away from the street and we slept like babies. A Perfect week.;5
I had a room on the 20th floor as did my colleague. I have stayed hotels all over the world and would never stay here again.   When the lift stopped at floors up to the 20th floor the corridors looked like a dodgy old American movie. Seems to house small businesses and community projects. Not a hotel at all.   The corridor between the lifts and our rooms were dingy and in need of a complete overhaul. It was actually quite creepy.   Staff were indifferent and I overheard some being extremely rude to guests unhappy with their charges. It seems some ‘extras’ are added on without notice.   The bedroom was tiny and in a poor state of repair. I could not believe the condition of the bathroom. Photos attached.   One morning, I went downstairs from the lobby to use the washroom. They;1
Location was perfect, check-in was a breeze, room was super clean and staff was unusually friendly for New York!!!  Gave us a double room with Empire State view on 36th floor...awesome... rooms were actually large...would recommend staying here.;5
I had a mixup with my reservation for an upcoming business trip and Neida helped sort everything out! She was extremely helpful and informative and even followed up with a phone call to make sure I was satisfied. Best customer service experience I have had thus far in New York.;5
Had a wonderful visit at the New Yorker a week before Thanksgiving.  Linda at the Front Desk was very helpful.  Even though the hotel was pretty booked she managed to upgrade me to a double which better accommodated me. The Lobby is very impressive and security at the elevator to assist guest with the appropriate elevators. When I arrive to my floor I felt I was taken back in time.  The hallway decor is of the old New York theme.  I would recommend they add New York Theme elevator music (i.e.,Empire State of Mine) would prepare you.  My room was the small traditional NY apt. style with everything you need.  The view was amazing!! will try to attach photo. The whole staff were very friendly and helpful regarding room service, directions, and assistance with getting a cab.  The;5
Good points- good location,clean room,comfy bedBad points- stayed 4 nights and was charged an extra £100 for use of the facilities ( which we didn't use) as when we checked in we were given a white card holding our 2 key cards and apparently this was our acceptance of these charges which were most definitely NOT explained by thr receptionist checking us in!!!!;2
Great trip to NY to see the Rockefeller tree. The New Yorker was great because of the ambiance. They could change a few of their policies though. Coffee in the room or at least in the lobby as one example.;4
Decent downtown hotel with adequate room but a small bathroom.  Staff was very accommodating and helpful.  24 Hour Diner on premises with 24 hour breakfast and good food. Two other restaurants as well.  I would recommend the Diner but not the restaurant on the main level.  Only had drinks in the 3rd location so no comment. Great Pizza just down the street 'New York Pizza Supreme'.  Starbucks across the street.;4
This hotel is rich in history and offers central location to many of the sites and locations for every traveler. My room was small but it was everything i needed. Staff were prompt and professional. Tick Tok dinner connected to lobby had great meals and excellent service.;4
This hotel is the perfect location if you are going to be doing shopping in New York.  Maceys  is just round the corner.  It was really busy when I was there but it was in early December and everyone seemed to be doing their Christmas shopping.  I was advised that I had been upgraded but the only difference between my room and my colleagues was the I had a tea/coffee maker.   The rooms are smallish but that is quite normal in New York City.  The staff there were very friendly and helpful.;4
Very friendly and helpful staff.  Quick check in and we received an upgrade to a bigger room with a fantastic view. Our hotel fees were also reduced to a minimum for each night of our stay. Also, was given wine and glasses for our Anniversary in our room. We were BLESSED!  The hotel is convenient to Times Square to walk and there is a McDonalds, Starbucks and a Pizza restaurant right across the street. The next block has a Vegan restaurant, an Italian sub shop and other eateries.  Macy’s and Penn station is around the corner and also subways are close by.  LOVED THIS HOTEL and I will be returning to stay there in the future!;5
What a great palace woww... Is was a veerry vwerry nice oplace to vit with the friends and family . Soooo great palace to visit. Soo leaceful nd enjoyfeul expirience it was . I just cant explain that amaging tour woowww sooo great. Soooo sooo goood tourrr;5
great location , easy check in & good service. Hotel is very accessible to all new york attractions , wyndham membership makes it easy to book & use points to book stay very quickly. Historical hotel near metro & bus terminals for other cities.;5
great location and friendly hotel. The building retains the character of when it was built and some of the rooms are a little small, but comfortable and provide a safe base for what just needs to be a place to eat, drink and rest. Across the road is The Madison Square Garden, and a few blocks further away is the famed Empire State Building.;4
Lynda was amazing at check in, we loved the Tick Tock dinner, the trattoria next door and the restaurant below.  Everything was amazing including the location.  I love the 20s and this was all of the charm but service of a chain hotel that you trust.  The maid service was so great, it was like we had our own service for our room.  After staying out late with family my husband used the pull out sofa to not wake me.  He couldn’t believe how comfortable it was and actually slept in!  Usually we stay in a different hotel every trip and in a different area but wewill definitely be staying here again!;5
A disappointing stay. The rooms are small, very dated, dark, no amenities. The hotel is busy and crowded with waits for reception and even bag check. The location is not great - busy and noisy part of town, limited good restaurants near by, far from good places to visit like museums, Central Park, etc.Can do much better at other hotels.;2
Myself and 3 friends stayed here for 4 nights. Our rooms had two beds and two bathrooms which was great. We knew about the room tax before we arrived so although we didn’t understand  what we were paying for it wasn’t a surprise. A mess up with check in saw us having our tax reduced by half. The staff were all friendly. It says a lot when you see Virgin flight crew there, can’t be bad!! The hotel is in a perfect location and close to great shops and areas of interest. It could use a lick of paint in some areas but the room was clean and tidy. We had tea/coffee making facilities (no milk though so had to use their creamer). During our stay we got advice about Uber and were advised on how to get a taxi to JFK. The guys outside flagged us down a taxi easily and we got to the;5
"The hotel is in a great location, close to Penn station and the best of New York City. The hotel is very safe and my room was super clean and modern. I stayed in a queen suite and I couldn't be happier with the room. It was big, comfortable and quiet. On the negative, the hotel seems to nickel and dimed you throughout your stay, starting with a ""daily facility fee"" of $29 and ending with a charge of $2 per bag for storage after checkout. As long as you understand and you are ok with the fees (and they are clearly disclosed in their booking engine), this is a great place to stay in Manhattan.";4
The hotel is a great location as your in the middle of New York, the rooms are clean which is perfect as it’s only to sleep etc , great value and great views.staff are helpful and always there to assist;4
I stayed here from 2nd to the 5th Dec 2018 with my 2 daughter's, sister-inlaw and niece, What a pleasure it was to stay here, We had a suite room with a view and wow what a view it was.  Showers were amazing, lovely hot hot water. Rooms were spotless.  We are definitely going to return in future.  Staff were very attentive and helpful . Only thing I would say was there was no tea/coffee in the room although you could get for a further charge.   alive attached some of pictures with the view from one of our windows.;4
Overall, I was not satisfied with my stay. When I was reserving the hotel, it showed a price of 220 per night and I was so excited to try this out. After I reserved and got the final receipt, I saw a slew of taxes + a facility fee of $30 each day for stuff I did not use! The facility fee should have been included upfront in room rate for sake of transparency. The breakfast at $20 was below average at best, and there was no amenities in the room - No microwave, no fridge, no bathroom counter to keep stuff on. Heck - not even a shower cap and shower gel (who uses soap cakes now, really?). The flush didn't drain properly and adjusting the shower head to get medium hot water was sucha task! I called the reception desk to request an iphone charger (since the lobby and the 36th floor;1
This hotel has been around a long time and despite renovations is weary. The decor in the room was dull and beige.  My room did not have a good view and was dreary and dismal, not much light was let in from the window.    While the bedding was new and updated, the furniture seemed old and dated.    The worst aspect of the room was the plumbing and heating controls.  The dual hot and cold water controls in the shower were unstable and hard to control.  It resulted in the temperature vacillating from scalding hot to freezing cold.  The tub surround also had been updated with new tile, but the tub was old and worn in appearance.  It took an extra ten minutes to take a shower to maintain the water at a comfortable temperature.  The room was drafty and it felt like turning the heat;2
Stayed for two nights on a brief trip to NY. The location is great, right by Penn Station and loads of shops nearby. We arrived much earlier than expected and were pre checked in and were able to leave our bags whilst we went sight seeing.  The room was good, although pretty cold and the heating a little noisy but worked to heat the room enough. If you’re a light sleeper I would bring ear plugs. Stayed on the 36th floor and the views were great. They have security in the lobby to stop non guests using the facilities which is reassuring. Friendly staff and ideal location.  We ate in the tick Tock diner for breakfast on the last morning, which was excellent;4
Spent 4 nights at the New Yorker and we opted for a Double Metro Room with a View, great view of the Empire State Building!   Only downside to this was it was a little noisy with the traffic and the sirens, but I expected it in New York.   Rooms were clean and the Double Metro room was larger than I thought it was going to be.  The hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to Time Square and Broadway, longer walk to Central Park but was not that far away.   All the staff were really friendly and very helpful.  The only disappointment I had with the hotel was the lack of Gluten Free food available. When I asked at the Concierge Desk on our first night (after a long day and we just wanted to eat and rest) they indicated that the Tick Tock Diner had options, I had;4
Just reopened does pub food, not a massive menu but what it does do it does very well.Love the place. Good beer and wine also.you can take dogs into the bar where there are doggie treats for them. Service is excellent and everyone is very friendly,;5
This is the third year we have stayed at the New Yorker and I wouldn’t stay anywhere else when visiting NYC. The views are breathtaking, the rooms are clean and spacious, the staff is friendly and professional. I always recommend this hotel for travelers!;5
We had two rooms on the 27th floor of the New Yorker. The plus point were the views directly of the Empire State Building and the friendly staff in the hotel (especially the cheery guy who serves the coffees and teas in the foyer)  The shower was a bit weird it was either very hot or cold and had to adjusted delicately to achieve the right temperature! Also for some reason the entry cards for the room stopped working (three times) so all the way back to the reception from floor 27 to get them fixed. There are plenty of lifts but be prepared to wait a few minutes each time for one as it is a huge hotel with hundreds of guests. That said we had so much to do during our stay that we were not in the hotel very often and the rooms are ideal. I'd definitely stay here again but would;5
Stayed in the new Yorker hotel for 4 nights on our first night stayed in a room on floor 22 the room was very tired and dated needed a lick of paint but on our second night we were moved to the 31st floor which had been refurbished and was lovely very clean , towels and soap and shampoo provided and hairdryer and iron and ironing board. Very central near Macy’s and Maddison square garden walking distance to Empire State Building and Times Square and Port Authority bus station where you catch buses to the shopping outlets such as jersey gardens and Woodbury common would stay here again and recommed to family and friends;4
Really good stay here, reception is beautiful n staff really helpful, in the morning there is a small coffee bar open serving drinks and pastries.  Lifts are a bit of a pain stopping at every floor when you are on the 27th or 40th floor.  Rooms are very clean but do need updating.  We visited for my 60th birthday and were given a room upgrade and a bottle of fizz also a cake made out of towels which was a really nice touch. We used the 8th Avenue concierge service for our airport transfers and they were excellent  Everything is within walking distance, maceys is 2 minutes away, Penn station and port authority 5 minutes walk  Would definitely stay here again;4
Great location close to Empire State Building, Macys and walking distance to Times Square. Tic Tock diner attached to the hotel good food and quite reasonable. Rooms in hotel are small but adequate for 2. Security is good in the hotel.  The staff on reception are unfriendly we had a problem and they were completely unsympathetic we had to ask to see a manager who was apologetic and helpful. There is a daily charge of $40 payable daily from your credit card some of which is for hotel amenities WiFi gym and business centre this adds substantially to the price.;4
Great location! We traveled into NYC by train and it is only a half block from Penn Station. They upgraded us to a corner suite with an incredible view so we were blown away by their service. We will be back!;5
Rooms are a good size with twin beds being double beds.  You have to ask for a coffee machine in the room but there is no charge for this facility, when requested, one was delivered to our room along with tea and coffee and paper mugs.  The machine made a decent cup of tea.  All staff very helpful and no one got access to hotel rooms without showing room cards so felt secure.  There are 2 restaurants to eat at, we eat at Tick Tock on our first night and it was reasonable. Hotel is in a great location for walking to most places of interest and is around the corner to Macey's.  It is also in a great location for Penn St station.  The down side to this hotel was a $22 dollar a night per room facility charge which was unexpected and came to £75 for our 4 night stay.  For this you;4
The hotel staff was extremely helpful and accommodating.  Located close to Penn Station.  The rooms were clean and nicely renovated.  I was visiting for work travel and this is definitely a tourist hotel.;4
The Wyndham was a pleasant hotel, yes it’s dated in some aspects but the whole hotel was spotlessly clean,and all the staff were so pleasant and could not do enough for you. Anyone wanting the perfect base to stay in NYC should not look any further than the Wyndham New Yorker.;4
Stayed here for the first time.  It is a great location if you go in by train, about a half block from Penn Station.  It is about a 20 minute walk to Rockefeller Center. The hotel is very nice, beautifully decorated.  The staff was all very friendly and welcoming. This is New York and it is the holiday time but..  I have never stayed in such a small room.  Just enough room to fit a bed, desk and desk chair.  The bathroom was THE smallest I have ever seen in a hotel.  You can't open the door if the shower door is open at all.   One negative - a towel from the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the door, with hair on it.  I called Housekeeping for more towels but none arrived.  I had to call again in the morning to the front desk.  We ate in the Butcher & Banker;4
Your typical NY hotel. The USP of this place is its location. Closer to Penn station/Macys and other touristy stops.  The rooms are typical NY, small but functional. The bathroom was well appointed. The gym is particularly great. As a place to spend few nights in NY , this is as good as any out there.;4
We spent a week here, celebrating my wife's birthday in NYC and this hotel was an excellent choice. Perfectly located to arrive from JFK Airport and to do our daily tips, Penn station and the subway is at the corner. Madison Square Garden is next door, came very handy when we went to see a game.  Upon arrival we were upgraded to a renewed executive room on the 8th floor, which was nice but didn't have a great view. Driss at the front-desk was very attentive and went over and beyond to please us. He managed to find a room from the next day on, arranged for moving our stuff while we were away - and then it was magic. We got a room on the 38th, with stunning views, facing the Empire States building. It was amazing to wake up to that view every morning.  The hotel was built in 1929,;5
Booked a last minute trip to NY with my daughter in law and 3 month granddaughter. We actually struggled to find many hotels that would accommodate 2 adults and a baby as we wanted 2 beds and a crib. Booked a Deluxe double (824) at the New Yorker and couldn’t have been happier.  The room was massive, with everything we wanted including 2 armchairs and a coffee table.  We asked for a crib, fridge and microwave and all 3 requests were granted without charge.  Beds were super comfy, towels were thick and fluffy and the heating was great.  The staff were all very friendly and everywhere we went people stopped and fussed over the baby, including suited business men and groups of teenagers.  The shower room was compact with not much space to put our toiletries and water pressure;5
I only live an hour from the city but I have never stayed overnight until recently at this hotel. All I have to say is that I couldn’t have asked for a better first experience! I was staying over in the city for a very special occasion and this hotel made it even better! I got to check in early and upgraded my room for a small fee. The staff were friendly and welcoming. When I got to the room, I was blown away by how nice it was! And the view...we had a gorgeous view of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden! At night it lit up very nicely! The location is very good as well, close to Penn Station and all other popular NY locations. If I were to ever stay in the city again I will most likely stay here again!;5
Me and my friend stayed stayed here on our first trip to New York, it seems to be the most popular in the travel agents & New York forums amongst many different travellers! We got the train and off at pennyslvania station it’s right across the road so easy access and a short walk with your cases if you don’t fancy the taxi fair to and from the airport! Check in was very quick we were informed prior to this that there are hotel taxes to be made which accumulated to $90 for our 4 night stay (Between us) although they do charge $150 off a card on file until you check out incase you use any of the amenienties (not sure what as there isn’t a fridge or mini bar in the room? Maybe just room service) the $150 did get refunded back into my card and we paid the $90 cash upon check out.;4
"I was not a guest of the New Yorker Wyndam Hotel; however, I was so disappointed by the hotel staff that I will never stay there. My husband was staying there on business, which happened to overlap with his birthday. In the 18 years, we have been together, we have never been apart on his birthday. As a surprise, I wanted to send something to his room on his birthday to let him know I was thinking about him. I have done similar surprises when we have traveled together, so I know it’s a common request.  I called the hotel around noon the day before and asked to speak with the concierge. I was transferred, and it went to voicemail. I left a message with a brief explanation of my request and my phone number. I did not hear back, so around 2:30 I called back. Someone answered the";1
I am a travel agent and recently had 2 clients come and stay in this hotel. They are very laid back clients. But they called me at 6:00 AM to explain to me that they were in the middle of a disaster. While they paid for an extra night to be able to check in early, they were denied early check in. Even though they had bought the room for that night. They were denied because it was still an 'early check in' which they couldn't do. They were finally let into their room hours later. Only to discover it was the wrong room. And even  though it was not the room on the reservation, they still had to pay $275 to upgrade rooms. And not to mention, he had to deal with the rudest staff ever. They then charged him twice (on 2 different cards somehow!) for his meal at the restaurant. Then;1
I booked this hotel in November, taking the time to speak to someone on the phone and booking as such.  I made it clear that I needed a suite with 2 bathrooms and a kitchenette area.  We had 4 adults and a teenager in our party.  The room they gave us first, had one bathroom and hardly enough room to move around in.  I made it clear that this was NOT what I booked.  They then gave us a room with 2 bathrooms.  There was no kitchenette area - not even a coffee maker.  When the sofa was pulled out, it took up the entire sitting area.  The paint was chipping off of the doors and the hinges were all rusted.  The room was unbelievably drafty!  When I called to speak to a manager, he told me that I was already upgraded at no charge and there was nothing more he could do.  This was NOT;1
The location is the only real positive. They gave us a “standard room” and I’m assuming because it was booked through Hotwire we were given the smallest room. We asked if we could pay for an upgrade and the gentleman rudely said no with no reason why.  The room kinda smelled funky. It was somewhat updated with new paint. The bed was so so. Security, maids, and bellman were nice. They do have a diner connected to the hotel which was great. The subway is located just outside which was a plus. This place is not a four star like the Lotte,  Westin, or the W. I would much rather have stayed at the Holiday inn or Crowne Plaza.  For the money you can get a better hotel. Will not be staying here again.;3
the hotel is very convenient to the to the subway ---just a few steps to the door of the hotel...starbucks is just across the street (but it is a small store but proficanet) about a 20 min walt to time square....or about 7$ Lift ride... Madison Square Garden is just steps away... the hotel is old and grand.... the lobby is new and refreshing... but the rooms do show their age with modern decor -very clean.  the shower water pressure could be a lot GREATER--but its ok.....there are 10 elevators (i think) and it can still get quite congested waiting on them (6 service the first 20 floors and the other 6 service the 20th thru 40th floors)  we were on the 40th floor in a suite that was comfortable with a separate siting area from the bed and bath and a TV in each room.   we could;4
Our first impression of the hotel was not that great.  We got dropped off but no one assisted us with our bags.  The doors were hard to open and one struggled to get into the lobby despite there being a doorman out the front.  Check in was fast but we had ask for someone to bring the bags to the room and then when we went to get the lifts up to the room we get bailed up by salesperson trying to sell us a share plan for the Wyndham  hotel chain.  After a very long flight we just wanted to get to our room. Also we were there for  a holiday not to buy a share in property.  Why would we give us some out time just to get a free breakfast to listen to their sales speil.  Unfortunately our impression got worse when we got to the room - it was small, old and had no fridge or coffee;3
While the check-in and breakfast lounge staff were friendly and helpful, this place is really part it’s heyday. I stayed there for a last minute business trip because it was the cheapest chain hotel in NY even remotely near my meetings, but I’d gladly fork over an extra $200 next time to stay somewhere without cracked tiles in bathroom, chipped painting and just gross infrastructure. Bedding and all was fine but slept kinda skeeved out.;2
Just a wonderful hotel & so artistically decorated. Very comfortable & the location fantastic - just two small blocks from Grand Central Station.  Also, great place to eat breakfast or lunch right here n the corner;5
We stayed here last month for 5 nights on 34th floor.  The room was extremely spacious with two double beds, bathroom although a little tired served it's purpose.  We could not have asked for anything more, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, housekeeping were fantastic.  The coffee pods were replenished every day, our beds made and towels changed daily. Fabulous hotel, looking forward to staying with you again next year!;5
My partner and I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel in December 2018. We had no problem booking a room here. It was my partners birthday whilst we were away so I  secretly contacted the hotel via email and asked to reserve the Muhammad Ali suite for the last 2 night's of our stay. This was simple and they confirmed this multiple times for me. On arrival we were met by one of the reception / guest services staff members, Alforza I think her name was. She remember emailing me about the suite and was ever so helpful. She had a bottle of champagne sent up to our room for my partners birthday and changed some fees for us which was very kind of her! He was so helpful to us.  The hotel itself is very art deco and old fashioned. But this is just so in keeping with the theme and feel of the;5
Everyone I interacted with from Doorman, Front & Bell Desk, and Restaurant were extremely polite and welcoming. I appreciated how staff asked guests entering the lobby elevator bank to show room keys.;5
Hotel is clean with fresh towels provided each morning, view from room was good ( on the 20th floor). Staff are friendly and helpful, including the room maids, security is good and not to intrusive or inconvenient. Great location, 10-15 minutes from Times Square on foot, Macey's slightly less. Penn subway 2 minutes, and Madison Square Garden across the street. The on- site diner, Tick Tock, serves good food at fairly reasonable prices and is convenient. The only negative point, could hear the taps and shower being used in the adjoining room either late at night or early next morning.;4
Fast check-in, small room but clean, comfortable with individual controlled air conditioner / heater, strategic location where near to Penn Station, coffee maker available upon request, very good services.;5
I stayed here in the very busy holiday season so rates were inflated ($450 per night all in)  This is a busy, large hotel and it’s well located in midtown Manhattan. My (late) checkin and normal checkout were quick and the staff courteous and efficient.  The room is fine, actually an OK size by NYC standards and the beds comfortable. The room shows a few signs of wear in places but everything you need is there and works. Bed was comfortable. The shower was a little temperamental but pressure was good. Room was wonderfully quiet on the 34th floor.  The Wi-fi was excellent in the room.  The lifts are busy and slow, so much so that you will want to limit travel back and forth to the room if you can (I bought my suitcase to breakfast).  Although it’s not classy I really liked the;4
Yes, you get 50% off room size (expect a tiny room, mabye 100sqf), 50% off tv size (mine was aprox 27 inch), 50% off service (we had to carry our four bags ourselves, no room service), 50% off room amenities (NO fridge inside the room, but yes, al least you have a safe box).  What gives a three star? Only location, a block away from MSG and Penn, and Macy's... Also, if you go expecting to see an Art Deco historical place, please, look for another Hotel. You will only find an old Hotel with no service at all.....;3
I was in this hotel for my honeymoon. My travel agency booked a room for me in this hotel for three days, then I left for a feq days and finally I came back for other five days. When I arrived in this hotel for the first period it was night and I was really tired beacause of the journey so I decided to say nothing: the room was not what I expected it had to be...small and with old bathroom. When I left I complained with receptionist asking to be placed in another room for my next stay.But they told me that my travel agency chose for me this room so they could do nothing.. After a few days out, I came back to New Yorker Hotel and I met Mohammed,a very nice a kind man,who after having listened to me, tried to help me...he waste a lot of time looking for a solution that could make;4
The New Yorker is in a perfect situation, close to Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens, and Macey's! If you arrive either by Subway or Long Island Railway ( bit dearer, but much quicker), the hotel is a hop, skip and a jump away. Lovely Art Deco hotel with warm, friendly and helpful staff.  Go for a room with a city view, it's well worth the extra. Breakfast has to be at Tick Tock, the restaurant adjoined to the Hotel.  This was our third stay at The New Yorker and we shall certainly stay there on our next visit.;5
The location is 5 min. walk from the bus terminal and across from the Penn Station subway stop..perfect location in the city.  The Hotel staff is exceptional and they have ground floor security and you must have a key to get to the elevators. They are connected to the  Tic Toc Diner is has fabulous eggs benedict and Nutella crepes! The art deco is grand!  I've stayed here 4 times and it's always first choice to stay here!;5
"When checking in we were offered a higher floor room but warned that it was a much smaller room. With that in mind we declined the offer. What we were given was a room barely large enough to fit the bed in. Thinking we had been mistakenly given a lower grade room we contacted reception twice to confirm and were told this was indeed correct. What size the smaller room was is anybody’s guess but this room was not large enough for both of us to get dressed in at once. Only one side of the bed had enough room left over for a table.   There were six taps in the bathroom; two in the sink, four in the bath servicing both the bath and the shower. All of them dispensed piping hot water. Upon request the hotel tried to address this and eventually we were able to get a reasonable shower";1
We stayed at the New Yorker  during the week of Thanksgiving. It was our 3rd trip to NYC and this hotel was by far the best! The location was great being so close to Macy's and all the other shopping. Also close by was Penn Station and the Empire State Building. We loved having the restaurants in the lobby too!;5
We had a four night stay in this hotel from 23rd November 2018 and can not recommend it highly enough! Excellent location close to MSG, Macy’s and ESB on 34th st. The room and bathroom were spotless and cleaned daily. A lady at check-in needs special mention- Kristle, who was extremely warm and welcoming and willing to help with anything. A great ambassador for the hotel.;5
I traveled to NYC with my family during Thanksgiving to see the Macy's parade and visit some of the sights.  I was very happy with the New Yorker.  The staff was very courteous and accommodating during a very busy time.  We had a corner view room on an upper story and the Empire State Building was gorgeous - especially at night!  The hotel is in a very convenient location - close to the subway and within walking distance of Herald Square and Rockefeller Center. We loved the Tick Tock Diner which was open 24/7 and had good food at reasonable prices.  For Thanksgiving dinner we tried the hotel restaurant and had a good meal there as well.  I would stay at the New Yorker again and recommend it to others.;4
I was so happy with our stay at The New Yorker. You can’t beat the location. The staff was amazing and having the 3 dining options in the hotel is great. The diner offers just about anything you’re in the mood for. The subway is located just outside of the hotel and Madison Square Garden, Macy’s and the Empire State Building are all in walking distance, plus much more. The bellhops are happy to help with a cab and are very friendly, as well as the rest of the staff.  Our room was great and the view was fantastic. I gazed at the Empire State Building from my bed every night.  I would definitely stay here again and am so glad we booked at The New Yorker.;5
Upon check in we were met with pretty unhappy staff.  Nobody seemed very happy.  There was no offer of assistance to get the luggage to the room.  The door man who you would think would help you get a cab was not very helpful either.  Every time in was faster to request another ride service rather than wait on him. The room was just okay.  Bathroom was extremely tiny.  I thought the rooms had a mini refrigerator in them but that was not the case.  I did call the front desk and they brought up a small one to keep in the room for a $20 charge.  The bed comfort was okay but the pillows they have are the really small ones.  Instead of a couple regular size pillows, there are like 6 half size pillows that were not very comfortable.  When taking a shower, the water would only get hot.;3
The  hotel is clean, the staff is great, the price is reasonable (for Manattan) and the amenities are complete.  I use the subway as much as possible when in Manhattan and the New Yorker is within a few yards of 3 subway lines and within a five or six minute walk of 11 more.  For anyone not wanting to use the subway, their cab stand nearly always has cabs or ubers standing in front of the hotel,  the doormen are quick to assist, and Penn Station and The Port Authority are within a five minute walk.  Security seems to be much better than many other hotels I have used in Manhattan.;4
Each year, when we go to see the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade in the Hersld Square area, we stay at tha Wyndham New Yorker.  Perfect location, excellent security and hotel services and most appreciated—indoor access to the Tick Tock Diner, a place that offers quality meals, 24/7, at low, low prices compared to outside the hotel. Love the views from the upper floors too! We always feel safe and comfortable at the New Yorker and will be back next November for sure.;4
Staff extremely friendly and helpful and must give a special mention about Charmine who we dealt with on check-in.  She ensured we had a fantastic stay.  Loved the location as extremely central. The Tick Toc diner served us well during our stay particularly as we had one of our party who required a gluten free diet and this was available to her. Will be returning to New York again and will definitely book the New Yorker😊;5
"We stay at The New Yorker Hotel every year on the night before Thanksgiving (we're in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade).  The location is perfect for our needs, and it's a terrific value for the three of us.  This year we stayed in the Nikola Tesla room, just for fun.     Nothing extraordinary happened (we left the Ouija Board at home . . . ); just a nice clean room in a great hotel in the center of Midtown.  We arrived a bit before noon on the day (Wednesday), and I went to the desk just to let them know we were there (fully intending to leave our bags at the bell desk).  The gal at reception told us our room was ready (!!!), so we went right upstairs.    They even accommodated our need for a late check-out after the parade.  Great people; great place.  The New Yorker is part";5
For the 2nd year in a row, my client has booked us into this spectacular vintage property! Completed in 1929, the Art Deco feel is there throughout the hotel. Comfortable cozy rooms with super-strong hot water pressure and easy to use heating/AC.      I wanted to extend my stay on my own after the conference I was attending, and Alexis helped me out first on the phone before I arrived, and then turned me over to the lady in charge: Kader, who arranged the switch-over at a far better rate than the client had paid for the group! Thank you, Kader! AND when I arrived onsite I was greeted and assisted by not only Kader herself, but the outstanding Lynn as well, who even did me one better by conferring with Kader and arranging an upgrade for me.       This hotel has a million guests;5
The staff was friendly, the rooms were clean and spacious, and everything we needed was with a short walk. The view from our room was amazing and the breakfast in the morning was great. You can’t go wrong with the New Yorker. I will definitely stay again.;5
GREAT! My chicken was fast and efficient. The check in staff and concierge were outstanding, great service.  My room is a little small, but I’m 6’4” so most rooms are small.  The bed was very comfortable. I have a slight problem with my television which was quickly repaired.;5
This hotel is in a perfect safe location for access to Penn Station, subways or walking...the hotel is in great condition...loved the fitness center...excellent security...room decor lovely...great having easy access to the Tick Tock Diner...;5
The hotel room was very clean and nice. The breakfast was very nice, on the 39. Floor with a stunning view over New York. The Empire State Building was very close, and Times Square, Central Park and lower Manhattan within walking distance. There were excellent shopping possibilities, Macy’s, Saks and many shops on Times Square. Would recommend eating at Black Burger and Lobster and Burger!;5
Really nice hotel, security on the lifts, plenty of seating in the lobby, one of the rooms we had was on the small size but was okay as we don’t spend a lot of time in the hotel, very good diner attached and a tea/coffee counter with pastries, very good position across from madison Square garden and penn street station.;4
I'm a travel agent based in the UK and we had an issue at check-in where in the client couldn't check in immediately due to an issue with one of our suppliers. I spoke with Neida on the front desk and she very efficiently dealt with the issue and managed to upgrade the clients free of charge as a gesture of good will. Neida was very professional and went above and beyond and is a credit to the hotel.;5
"We wanted a queen bed which I reserved online. Then, my son joined us and I called the hotel to arrange for a room that could accommodate a roll-away bed. Apparently, the rooms are so small that a special room had to be selected that could accommodate the roll-away bed. When we arrived, there was no special room reserved for us. The staff at the front desk kept asking ""what was the name of the person you spoke with?"" as if that could make the room appear. In the end, we got a room with two double beds and virtually no window and various explosive sounds from other rooms, including a constant ventilation noise. With the $62 required, daily fee added for ""free overseas phone calls, free internet, use of the fitness center, and taxes, I wouldn't stay here again. I had loved it";2
I’ve stayed many times now, the gym is brilliant for Manhattan when you don’t want the hustle of the city. Tick tock has impeccably quick service may I suggest some healthier options but will not complain as it’s nice service.  Bigger than average rooms in NYC;5
A Good hotel to stay for a few days. Not a luxury hotell but good for you to sleep. It´s ok because when you visit New York you usually return to hotel just to sleep. Thinking about that, for me it´s ok.   The rooms are small. I had to upgrade my room because it was sooo small and I was with my mom.   The best point to evaluate your choice is the location, which is near the Madison Squate Garden.  I truly recommend.;4
We booked the room looking for somewhere central with a bit of space, payed for a larger room. We were on 36th floor with a great view of Empire State. The room was very small, without enough room to put our suitcases out of the way. On top of the daily extra fee which is added to your room cost for use of internet, gym and phone we paid extra again for a coffee maker and fridge. The bathroom was tiny and had very limited shelving to put anything. We heard a lot of noise from our neighbours, including voices, toilets flushing, blow dryers. We also had room service knocking on our door at midnight to deliver pillows and blankets - wrong room and it was hard to get back to sleep.  On the positive side we were close to Penn Station, Tic Toc was fantastic and was the bar and;3
Stopped here beginning of November for one night before joining the Queen Mary 2. Hotel is in a fantastic location and only a 5 minute walk from Times Square . Hotel itself has a grand lobby but once you go to rooms you will find it very tired and in need of some TLC . Room decor is brown and drab and bathrooms and on desperate need of a refurb . Room had a great view . Check in was a bit of a disaster as my reservation could not be found . Found the reception desk manageress quite surly and rude . One great find is the Tic Toc diner attached to the hotel . Will review separately . Overall for one night o would return purely for location and diner;3
This hotel probably has one of the best locations in the city. From here you can get subway access to pretty much anywhere in on the island and surrounding areas. The New Yorker has a very nice old school classic charm to it but I think your overall experience will depend on what type of room you get. We got upgraded to a classic queen suite which was very nice but the bathroom was very small (you had to close the door to be able to get to the toilet paper and I could sit on the toilet and wash my hands at the same time). We didn’t spend a lot of time in the room since we did a lot of sight seeing in the city so it didn’t bother us too much.   Based on location, I would probably stay here again as it was so convenient with Penn Station basically right outside (wish the Knicks;4
What a depressing place.  We had to get a last minute hotel in midtown and this was close.  It seems like a rent by the hour hotel.  We stayed downstairs until it was time to sleep because the room was so horrible;2
From the moment we checked in at reception with Mohammed everything has been superb .. got given breakfast vouchers by him as it was my daughters birthday - great gesture - he is an asset to this great hotel- will definitely stay here when we visit again .. both rooms were allocated especially for the views and WOW!! Thank you Mohammed and New Yorker hotel for making this a great vacation;5
What a good hotel 1929 so plenty of olden charm .could do with a few touch's to bring it up to date but on the whole good location for places if you want to walk everywhere which we did .the room was on the small side but we liked that nice and cosy .beds and pillows are perfect for good sleep .Have a high floor if possible to help get away from the noisy street and cabs honking all the time.the staff were all very helpfully. We did have a small issue but are treating it as a mistake that the room cleaner never owned up to .we had a bag of things on the windowsill which we think she thought was rubbish and it went .no real money value but lots of sentimental things from the trip .the hotel did give us breakfast vouchers for the tick tock diner to compensate.;4
Me & my partner stayed for 3 nights in the New Yorker. Basic hotel. Lovely building in its heyday. The decor could definitely do with updating. Staff mediocre.  Bedroom was small, but done the job. It was clean which was the most important thing for us. The rooms on floor 32 where we were, are located quite close together so be prepared to hear other guests talking, opening & closing doors. The street noise wasn’t too bad, the odd siren here and there, but you’d expect that in NYC. The $29 a day charge is ridiculous and non negotiable. The location is fantastic and for that I’d stay here again. I would completely avoid the yellow taxis outside the hotel and in New York generally.. Uber all the way. Clean, friendly, courteous & nice cars, as opposed to the shoddy, dented,;2
Stayed at The New Yorker for 4 nights. It’s location is fairly central for getting around New York and all the attractions. Our room was always kept clean. The room itself was small and basic but that wasn’t really an issue for us as we were only using it to put our head down each night so it served its purpose.  Be aware they charge a compulsory $31 a night fee for facilities. I personally think this is a bit of a scam. They say it’s to allow use of conference centre, gym WiFi and international phone calls. I wasn’t in New York for a conference or to use the gym and my phone provide 02 charged £4 a day for the internet, phone calls and messages which is a heck of a lot cheaper than they are charging.  My partner is with 3 she didn’t have to pay anything with her contract.  This;3
I would suggest bypassing this hotel.  Checking in took forever.  My room was barely large enough for the bed and I could hardly walk around from one side to the other since the desk chair was in the way and there was no place else to put it.  Whatever, I dealt with it.  But when I woke up in the morning to take a shower before my meeting and had no hot water, that was unacceptable.  I let the water run for a full 20 minutes while standing there sticking my fingers in every few minutes all to no avail.  I ended up having to go to my meeting without taking a shower!  It was horrible.  Not the hotel's fault, but I also had someone try to come into my room.  Since the door was right next to the bed, it felt as though they were already in my room and incredibly intrusive.  Oh, and;1
Stayed 7 nights at The New Yorker. Foyer is a grand art deco style and very welcoming. Staff plentiful even late PM and very early AM.  'Tick Tock' the associated diner is open 24 hours for a typical American dining experience. The bar 'Trattoria Blanco', is great for drinks and bar food.   Although rooms are small and compact and might have seen better days, they are clean, well equipped and comfortable and daily cleaning service was excellent.  Our room was at the front of the hotel on the 22nd floor, with a “view” of the Empire State Building, there was always a slight buzz of noise from the streets, which was actually quite comforting at night.   Trip was planned for my husbands 50th birthday and Mohammad, at the Reception Desk, did a fabulous job of organising a room;4
The location is excellent. There are plenty of security and concierge people to help. My room was tiny, although fairly modern. Wifi worked very good.  The rooms are quite noisy all day and night from city noise, including police sirens at low-frequency rumblers which shake everything. The hotel needs to invest more in soundproofing.  For a hotel of this price range, would it be so hard to have a mini-fridge come standard with the room?  Another issue - check in. We checked in at 1 AM, and had to wait about 10 minutes for the 1 guest in front of us who chatted incessantly with the front desk staff. At least we didn't check in during the day time - the 2 days we were there, the line was often 30+ people deep.  The fitness center was phenomenal - huge, with quite a few aerobic and;4
"Take the stairs in the lobby downstairs to visit an exhibit that shows the history of this amazing hotel. We found we appreciated it more for knowing more about it.   The location is great. The subway and Penn station are right there. We had an early flight and walked to Penn Station with our roller bags and caught the train to Newark. Very convenient.  Our room was small but very clean. The bathroom was ""vintage"" but everything worked and when we are in New York, we do not spend a lot of time in our room. It was perfect for us.  Our room was situated in a corner, with windows on two sides. This was a nice bonus, but it did mean a long walk from the elevator thru a maze of turns. One might be tempted to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find the way, but the signage was clear and";5
We stayed at the hotel from the 20th to the 26th November 2018. I was so disappointed with the attitude of the hotel manager that dealt with our issue. We received an invoice from our booking partner and when our credit card was billed we were billed extras when I questioned what these were I was advised that there are facilities charges wifi that to be honest did not work in the room or in the lobby this is a compulsory charge, whether you use the facilities or not, it should be added to the cost of the room as it really felt like a sneaky extra at the end of our trip. these charges were not factured into our spending for the few days we were there and these hidden charges were added at the end of our holiday please be aware of these hidden charges.  Also Tick Tock diner on the;1
Stayed here for an extended family birthday celebration and it was excellent. Staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. The folks at the front desk couldn't have been nicer and gave us rooms with great views of the Empire State. I would highly recommend the New Yorker, it's a great location with lots of shopping and restaurants within easy walking distance. Also, the hop-on, hop-off bus tours are located within easy walking distance and you have lots of subway access nearby too. The rooms were very comfortable and are kept very clean. The hotel has a number of restaurants located in the building and they are all really good. If you're looking for a hotel from which to see the sites and get around easily then I'd recommend you check out the New Yorker. We will definitely be;5
We stayed at The New Yorker for 5 nights from 18th November. Slight mix up by our travel agent was sorted by the brilliant Cornelia at reception who also gave us some good tips for NY and was generally very friendly and helpful.  Our room was on 34th floor and, whilst nothing spectacular, it was perfectly functional given we didn't plan on spending much time in the room. Bed was really comfortable, lots of hangers in the wardrobe and our cleaner also did a great job. The view from our room was amazing and I would recommend going for a high room.  The hotel really is in the perfect location right by Penn Station. Perfect for travel by air train and LIRR from JFK and for getting around whilst in NY. Would really advise getting the weekly MTA travel card for $30ish which allows;4
Loved hotel. Had room on 19th floor, really large with 2 bathrooms. Beds really comfy. Everything spotless clean. Staff were all friendly and helpful, especially Linda in check in. Had meals in Tick Tock diner. Food was marvellous each time and very reasonable prices. Can't wait to return;5
We had a few questions before our arrival as travelling with a toddler (and wanted to make sure all was in order before our arrival) and contacted the hotel via Facebook messaging. They were superb and nothing was too much of a bother (before and during our stay).   We were informed of the facility fee via the hotel when contacting as our provider didn’t inform us! It’s on there website and they were very apologetic about it. We got our provider to pay us and then paid the hotel when we arrived - as its clearly advertised on their website. This did first annoy us but actually having free WiFi really helped us as could plan, google and share information as well as entertain our toddler by using YouTube etc.   The hotel was originally built in 1930s so it’s got that lovely Art;5
My fiancé and I travelled to NY for my birthday and I have to say I was surprised with how poor this hotel was. The location is good. It’s next to Penn station allowing easy access to the subway. Also within walking distance is the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Port authority bus station, Macy’s. My biggest issue with the hotel was its cleanliness. I wasn’t expecting anything special based on other reviews, the hotel is in dire need of a refurbishment with paint peeling off the walls and very old window frames that allow the cold in (it was -6 the day we left and the room was cold when we woke up, though there is an old noisy heater that can be switched on). For all of its cosmetic deficiencies (which I can get over) I would expect a clean room. Not the case. Thick;2
This is my second trip in which I stayed at the hotel, this time was to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday and her first trip to New York.  Although the hotel is starting to look a bit dated with its carpeting and furniture it is still a comfortable, great location to stay.  Within one block of Macy’s and other attractions within walking distance the pros out weigh the cons.  One slight problem was when leaving left luggage the queue was long and about a 20 minute wait.  Another con is the daily “facility fee” of $29.00 plus $2.57 tax which is an unexpected surprise on check in.  Whether this applies to all hotels I do not know.  The Wi-fi was fast and reliable.  If your looking for a relatively cheap hotel within easy walking distance to most main attractions I would;5
Nice art deco hotel, perfect location. We had a suite on the 39th floor. With breathtaking city views. Don’t expect large rooms. Although the suites are big enough. Would stay there again! On walking distance of Central Park, Time Square and Macy’s. Madison Square Garden just across the street. Don’t forget to check who’s performing while you’re there. We saw The Eagles, and made great memories! Enjoy your stay!;4
Me & my husband  stayed  for 4 nights . Staff are friendly and helpful.  Great location  for times square  , Broadway  , empire state building  , Penn station  , shopping eating out  .the tick tock diner  is a great place to eat . Would go again  . Rooms are nice n big bathrooms are great.  Bed is comfortable  . Had a amazing  views from our room on the 30th floor .;5
Just spent four nights at this hotel and it is a gem. Ideally situated on west 34th and 8th we had a room facing straight down 34th to the Empire States Building. From the 21st floor what a view !!  Given the week was very very cold it was great to come back to a warm room, the cleaning was daily and spotless and all of the staff were polite and efficient.  One word of warning beware the ' resort' fees banged on your card on check in;5
Perfect hotel! Perfect location! Easy walking distance to the parade. The staff is so friendly and helpful. We had a great time and this was the perfect hotel for a visit. We went specifically to see the Macy’s Thanksgiving day parade and we were not disappointed by our hotel location. Very clean and very well appointed rooms.;5
My husband and I stayed at the New Yorker because of the convenience to Penn Station and Macy's, as we are volunteers for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.  We were pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was.  We booked the smallest room with a queen sized bed.  It was small, but comfortable, spotlessly clean, and had everything we needed.  The hotel staff was courteous, friendly and helpful.  We enjoyed the Tick Tock Diner which is located within the hotel.  Great food and atmosphere.  Overall, we have already recommended the New Yorker to friends, and look forward to our next stay there.;5
Our stay was one our best experience in NYC.  Simira (hope I am spelling it correctly) at the front desk and doorman Freddie (Met us with a smile and helpful hand) made our check in and stay delightful from the time we stepped on the property.   Simira put together a thoughtful little gift bag of goodies for our daughters 15th birthday that put a smile on all our faces. Thank you!   Our room was clean and gave us plenty of space to relax comfortably between adventures in the city.   The location of the New Yorker is ideally located next Penn station, Madison Square Garden, Macy’s and plenty of other classic NY sites.  Weather you are walking or taking a taxi or train the New Yorker is perfect. We will be back and would recommend the New Yorker to all travelers.  Keep up the;5
My wife and I like this hotel because it is one block form Penn Station, there’s a Metro entrance at one corner of the hotel. You can walk to most any Broadway show. The staff is very courteous. There are 3 restaurants on the premises. A 24 hr restaurant and 2 others.;5
The new Yorker is a classic throwback hotel in decorum with up-to-date luxury amenities. I was treated with the utmost respect and courtesy by their great staff at the time of my stay. I will say the walk up price charge for check in, is a bit steep. I was really satisfy with the deal I got and worked out with Wyndham rewards staff in allowing me to stay for my time at the hotel. Being from New York growing up there and coming back to visit made it all worth the while at this classy establishment. I can't wait to stay here again. You can't beat NYC views!;4
The New Yorker is about a block from Penn Station, and no more than a block or two from several major subway lines serving Manhattan. Times Square is about a 10-minute away. The rooms were basic, no more room than needed for people planning to spend as much time as possible out in the City.;5
We booked a 4 night stay through Thomas Cook. This was my 1st visit to New York and was looking forward to seeing the city sights. On our arrival at the hotel the reception was very busy but we were checked in by Jessica and although our room wasn't ready we took the opportunity to have a look around.  All the Staff were very helpful and friendly and the hotel is full of memories of a bygone era. Our room 719 is a twin with the comfiest beds and although the shower room is small the shower is amazing. Housekeeping was very efficient . Security is also good and overall we really enjoyed our stay.;4
We stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker for a week during our recent New York holiday. We found the hotel to be very well run with excellent service....nothing was too much trouble. The room , albeit on the small side was comfortable and good value for money with a very comfy bed, crisp clean sheets changed frequently and the shower was amazing! We asked for a coffee making machine and it was provided within minutes. The location was fantastic in easy walking distance to see the Empire State Building, Madison Square Gardens And Times Square. All in all a fantastic holiday ...We’d definitely recommend this hotel!;5
Just back from an amazing stay. It’s the first I’ve stayed at this hotel & it will definitely be on the list to stay here again. The room was clean & spacious we had a view of the Empire State Building. The staff were friendly & helpful.;5
Everyone was very friendly and accommodating. Our room was spacious (for New York) and very clean. The beds were comfortable. Beautiful view of the city and close to lots of attractions. I loved the nostalgic feel of the building. We will definitely be back!;5
We stayed at The New Yorker Thanksgiving Week.  We have passed this hotel many times and we finally decided to book it.  I am glad we did, the service is top notch.    Kudos to Jessica and Linda at the front desk, both of them were exceptional in helping us check in.  There were some issues but it was not their fault.  We decided to upgrade to get a fabulous view of the Empire State Building and a view of Madison Square Garden.  The room was spacious only downside was the bathroom.  It was very small and you had to be careful with the sink because water would just spray out if you lifted the handle to high.  Nothing major, you learned to deal with it.   Location was awesome, walking distance to Macy’s, Target, Kmart and many more stores.  McDonalds and a pizza place was across;4
Love coming to The New Yorker! Right across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Group. Easy walk to theatre district! Rooms are comfortable, bathrooms a bit outdated. Staff very friendly and helpful. Tick Tock Diner in hotel has excellent breakfasts! 😊;4
"First, the hotel is really old but so convenient. The room was very small but adequate for most of our needs.We just made sure we didn't make any sudden movements. We were provided the room by our tour operator, Road Scholars. Since we were going to be in NYC after the tour ended, we extended our stay but in a corner suite on a much higher level. This room had many windows/views, but interestingly it had a ""patio"" that was almost walled in, so one had to stand to see over the edge. Should we ever consider staying here again, we think we'd choose one floor down so we didn't have a totally useful patio blocking some of our view. While convenient to the subway, Penn Station was right next door, we regretted not going back to an earlier hotel that we loved. That was the WestHouse";2
We drove to NYC, and from the moment we arrived to the time we departed, staff at every level and every station were friendly and helpful. Our room was comfortable, and room attendants were always ready to assist. We appreciated the central location, the convenience for both walking and subway, and the overall value of staying at the New Yorker. We will surely stay again.;5
My daughters and I stayed at the The New Yorker during a college visit.   We chose this hotel because it has dorm housing and we wanted a realistic experience of living at The New Yorker as a college student.  The location is perfect!   Subway is around the corner.  View of the Empire State Building.  Walking distance to Times Square, the Theater District, shopping, great restaurants.  The staff was very friendly during our stay. The spacious lobby was perfect for drinking morning coffee.   Only negative is the staff at the Tick Tock cafe.   We arrived to the hotel at 3 am and were excited the cafe diner was open. The food was okay.  The service was slow, and the staff was downright rude.  Overall, a great stay and will definitely be staying at The New Yorker again!;5
Beautiful hotel from the minute you walk in - the chandelier in reception sets the tone for the hotel. Everything thing is quick and efficient considering the amount of rooms and guests. The staff couldn't do more to help you.   There are vending machines on every floor and ice machines. The rooms had everything needed including a great coffee machine with plenty of supplies. Great view of the Empire State Building and everything within walking distance. The Tick-Tock diner is open 24 hours with great food to suit everyone.  This is my second time to stay here and wouldn't go anywhere else. Walking distance to Macys, Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building and Times Square. All other places of interest easily accessible using the Metro and Subway.  5 STARS FROM ME.;5
Myself, my mother and our friend started here 13-19 November and cannot recommend the hotel highly enough: We arrived from the UK at around 2030 and the foyer was full, however, Mohammad took us aside to his desk and attended to all our needs. We had requested a accessible room or one with a shower as my mum has mobility issues. Despite the hotel being FULL, Mohammad took the time to investigate what suitable accommodation was available and then upgraded both of our rooms free of charge to ensure we had a suitable bathroom. Then, after giving us time to settle in, phoned to ensure all was ok!! This man has customer service skills and deserves every accolade. I cannot praise him highly enough and we are so grateful!!   The rooms where very spacious with a wonderful city view.;5
Stayed in this hotel last week. Told them during reservation that we were getting married. On arrival room had been upgraded with great viewsof Empire State Building  and the lovely lady on reception delivered a bottle of champagne to the room. Room was decent size and always clean. Hotel is in a great position on 8th Avenue at 34th street. Subway outside and many places to eat nearby. Stones throw away from Empire State Building and Macy’s. Ate in the tick tock diner downstairs. Food was lovely but we only had breakfast.;5
The hotel was located perfectly with a quick walk to Madison Square Garden, Broadway, or any of the great eateries. The room was clean, the lobby spacious and upscale, and each staff person was friendly and helpful. We are staying there again in two weeks and will be our go to place whenever we are in the city.;5
This is my second stay here it is still wonderful.  Good location, great history, and iconic hotel near the Empire State Building.  Tip when you check in and you might get a nice view.  The beds are comfortable.  The rooms are clean.  The staff are friendly.  We will stay here again.  For a reasonable price room near everything, this is the place to stay.;5
Hotel was nice for a short break but I wouldn’t stay again due the ‘resort fee’ they add on when you leave. I know lots of hotels are doing it but it doesn’t mean you have to. Leaves a bad taste just have clear pricing if you want an extra $30 a night then just put your price up!;3
Stayed at The New Yorker for five days and just arrived home. Really nice hotel not too far away fro Times Square and all the other must see attractions. We booked to include breakfast in the Tick Tock restaurant which is well worth the extra. If we come back to New York we will definitely be returning to the New Yorker.;5
We visited ny for my daughter 21st birthday present. On arrival we were offered an upgrade which we accepted at an additional 75 dollars per night that included all services . This was not the case when we checked out as the service charge was added at 22 dollars per night plus tax . The hotel beds were small more like a large single the draft from the windows meant we had to sleep with heating on which meant for a stuffy room. Overall this did not hamper out holiday and would stay again;4
Room was well furnished. Clean room, with small sitting area. Traveled with my sons 12 & 15. Great location to get around town. Right next to subway. Would definitely stay here again. Bathroom small, but functional.  Restaurant on site.;5
I’ve never checked into a hotel were the reception staff put the pressure on to upgrade basically telling you on arrival your room is small and you should up grade for a more suitable one !  We did not upgrade Thankgod as it would of cost another 130 odd dollars ! The room on the 22 floor was actually ok to be fair but the shower was awful. At best a warm mist came out in the morning and by 7pm only cold water was available, luckily we were only staying for three nights.   The door staff were lovely and the tick tock dinner meal and staff really great.  However lasting impressions again of reception staff who seemed to not want to give back a room desposit of an upgrade we did not have. This was sorted in the end and I will be keeping an eye on my credit card to make sure ! We;2
I selected The New Yorker because of its iconic and amazing building. Location is excellent too. I was though a bit worried of previous reviews pointing out the quality of the rooms. Disappointingly the worry became real.  I had higher priced suite on 39th floor. Bigger room with separate living room space at high floor with a view.  The room is gloomy, tired and had moldy smell. Not fresh visually nor physically. I had the view, but the windows are small and my view was blocked by pillars - it is still better than looking at another building’s wall.  Bathroom followed the suit. The quality of shower was bad, water pressure low, shower head loose and old spattering the water unevenly and weakly.  The room is a big disappointment. Though the bed was good and on higher floor the;3
"I visites NY for a medical reason, needed to have papers faxed, etc., it was a sfressful time for me and my son who travelled with me.   Whatever we asked the guest reception desk, any lobby staff, they said ""anything you need just let us know and well take care of it"". Amazing and true. The entire staff is outstanding. Housekeeping staff is efficient and friendly. Room service is quick and professional. There were days I couldnt leave the hotel and everything i needed was just a phone call away. Tick Tock diner is a classic.  Trattoria Blanca is excellent and both are accessible from the hotel lobby.  The staff's genuine concern put me at ease from check in to check out. Also visit the Wyndham rewards desk in the lobby. Room was amazing 3501 beautiful views, exactly as pictured";5
The Hotel is in a good location and on the whole the staff were friendly. We were slightly disappointed with the room which was a lot smaller than anticipated and a little tired and for the price did not feel like value for money. The lack of tea/coffee making facilities was also a negative.  The bathroom also felt like it needed an update.;3
A fantastic hotel with friendly and helpful staff, especially Muhammad who made this trip extra special when he found out it was a 50th birthday trip.  Excellent mid-town location very convenient to Penn and Pennsylvania Stations, be warned they are different, lesson learned :-)  Close to Times Square, Maddison Square Garden and an easy walk to Javits Center.  Would be more than happy to return.;5
The hotel was in a good area close to every place we wanted to go, shopping restaurants and more.  The rooms were clean and the hotel itself was clean all the time. The staff was wonderful and everyone smiles all the time.  The hotel has 2 restaurants with a bar and a wide range of drinks food and desserts.  We really enjoyed being at a hotel in the centre of business. We would certainly love to go back there but in the summer. LOL 😁😁;5
Just checked in, grotty hotel with limited facilities. Part of a BA holiday. Only thing going for it is location. Hopefully  we will be so busy that only have to sleep here. Will not rush back. Premier inn is cleaner, has better facilities and a higher standard.;1
We stayed here because of the location.  Our first night was on the 23rd floor.  The tv didn’t work, the faucets dripped all night, the bed was really only a double not a queen, the neighbors fought all night long, & the road noise was horrible.  Not to mention that the room was tiny!  I asked to be moved, the next night was better but the tv didn’t work & the bathroom sink didn’t drain.  Very old section—request lower floors.;2
It’s located a good 10 mins from Times Square but bang next door to Madison Square Gardens and Penn St station. When I was getting prices, it was always at the cheaper end of the spectrum but when I went to visit I was quite impressed by the decor. I believe that they are renovating rooms doing 2 floors at a time so you need to make sure you ask for one of those;4
I’d read mixed reviews prior to coming but my room is everything I need. It’s small but the bed is super comfortable, the water is hot in the shower and the views are to die for. The only negative is no fridge but that's not been a problem. The hotel is close to Penn Station and an easy walk to the Theatre district. My room is tastefully decorated, certainly not tired as others have suggested and I’ll definitely stay here next time I visit NYC;5
Well the New Yorker exceeded all expectations! We were recommended this hotel by a friend and we were not disappointed. From the minute we checked in to the minute we left this was a home from home! We were lucky to have been checked in by Michael - it was a busy time at the desk however he took the time to speak with us and congratulate us on our anniversary the reason for our trip. We were staying for 9 nights in total and we were so fortunate that we were upgraded into a suite. Michael was attentive and such a pleasure to speak with that he alone deserves the full star rating for this hotel! I admit we were spoilt with an upgrade and it did make all the difference to our stay. We were on one of the top floors and the view was tremendous. The hotel room was exceptionally clean;5
"We stayed at this hotel for three nights not knowing exactly what the experience would be like since we read some mix reviews, but after the three wonderful nights which was almost four full days we can tell you that this is an excellent hotel.  To start, the location of this hotel is excellent; we walked two short blocks from Penn Station to the hotel that took us less than five minutes.  What other hotel would you find where you didn't need to take a taxi or the subway to get there?  Then as we arrived at the hotel we could see how beautiful it is from the inside.  Compare this hotel to others and you will realize that you will not find many others like this one in NYC.  Some may call it old, we call it grandeur because of its classic look.  The front desk service was";5
The room was great. We were there for two nights. Bathroom a little small. There were no wash cloths, only towels.  Loved being there.  I was happy for restaurants on premises.  Employees were very friendly.;5
The hotel was in a fantastic location! We would definitely go again based on location alone. The hotel is historic, which is nice. The bathroom inside our room felt quite dated and small however, the size of the room itself was great and we were happy with the view. We really can’t find any faults and would recommend staying there!;4
Stayed there with my family for a 4 day break  Hotel a bit dated, rooms were very small and breezy the windows not that great always a draft other rooms overlooking our room, had to keep curtains drawn most of the time shower had a mind of its own going hot and cold My son and he’s girlfriends room was a box room 11 floors below ours . He’s view was a wall . Asked to be moved and was told no they can’t upgrade. Never asked for 1 just a room with some sort of view  But still the answer was no  After having saved for so long a bit disappointed  Apart from that a good location to see all the attractions;4
This was our second time staying here - the location is great, just a short walk to Times Square, and about 20-25 minute walk away from Central Park. The rooms are small with a tiny wardrobe so we lived out of our suitcase, but it was always clean which is all I’m really bothered about! We did have an issue with the room on the first night, but we spoke to a lady at reception and our resort fee was reduced for the inconvenience - dealt with promptly and professionally.   The tick tock diner is convenient but it can be a bit pricey - there is a cafe bistro just around the corner which do  nice breakfasts for a third of the cost, so we ended up going there most mornings.   We also got use of the gym, all the basic equipment for a good workout!  Overall very pleased with our stay;4
Tipical and historical NYker hotel. It's huge, a bit dirty, a bit old style, but confortable enough for 1 single occupancy of the quite small room (I was the only one of our group - 9 people - to have a view). No facilities (forget fridge and coffee/tea set), there's always a long queue to speak to the reception, not so polite... But it's a hotel with character, maybe I'll go back there.;3
I stayed here in October 2018 due to its proximity to the garden as. I had booked tickets to see the eagles. The rooms were clean and spacious and check in is easy. Stayed there last year as well although the view from the room was poor this year. This hotel is in a great location for Times Square, Broadway and the Empire State buildings. The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable.  Staff were very helpful with bus booking etc and were very informative about New York making our stay that much easier. We had a flooded room one night that was immecistely attended to. Can’t thank the staff enough. Will definitely be back.;5
I have just returned from my stay at this amazing hotel. If it wasnt good enough that the hotel is in an excellent location within walking distance to many of the main sights , it even has perfect views from the rooms of Empire State Building, Chrysler Building , Madison Square Garden and others! To top it all off the staff are great! Every one of them were friendly and helpful!  I need to say a huge thank you to Emily and the staff who helped me plan my proposal to my now Fiance and set the room up to perfection the way I wanted.;5
Location is the USP of this hotel, almost everything in Mid Manhattan is walking from this hotel. Central Park, Times Square, Empire State, etc. Very happening neighborhood, gives a real feel of New York streets.;4
When we reached early around 9AM, hotel staff were very courteous and offered us early check-in early without even asking us. Room where we stayed had a very good city view.  The location of the hotel is superb. Many attractions like Times New Square, Empire state building, Fashion street, Metro station are walkable from this hotel.  Flipside of this hotel is no micro-wave oven and no coffee maker in the room.  Room was very clean and staff were very helpful and friendly. Overall we enjoyed our stay in the hotel.;5
"Ideally located beside Penn Station and with the fantastic Tick Tock Diner attached, this is a perfect hotel for exploring Manhattan. McDonald's, Starbucks and the lovely Italian restaurant ""Famiglia"" are directly opposite the hotel entrance.";5
We spent one night prior to a cruise at the New Yorker .. first time in NYC  *used the hotel car service from LGA / no issues and less than 25 minutes on a Friday morning ! *Smack dab in the middle of EVERYTHING!  *the most STUNNING lobby ! This hotel is CLASSIC (built in the 30’s!!!) *terrific receptionist ! We arrived at 930 AM and rather than having to wait - the lovely lady got us into a room early ! *old fashioned bell security where you must show your room card to use the elevators (loved it ) *the room was small (as expected In NYC) but spotless and had been completely renovated. *if you go to the basement you can read all the amazing history of this magnificent hotel on the walls with newspaper clippings etc posted . *we LOVED this hotel and absolutely appreciated its;5
He couldn’t of been more helpful.  Myself and friend were looking for a place to dine and things to do in New York.  He gave us plenty of ideas all of which were fantastic!!!  We went to 911 memorial along with a lot of sightseeing on the Big City Bus. Hop on hop off;5
My family and I loved our stay. The staff were superb in delivering a fabulous service. Our rooms were to die for and the cleanliness of our room was maintained by a hard working housekeeping team.  Would highly recommend to all!   The only issue was a slow check in... But generally what an amazing hotel :);4
We arrived a bit early and were immediately able to get into our room which was nice, clear, though a bit small (but probably not for NYC). However, we had some problems as one of us fell (a couple of blocks from the hotel) and was injured. The hotel employees couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. We even told one employee that we were going to an urgent care place (very nearby) and might be late returning (we were supposed to be checking out. She followed us out to find out the room number and the manager immediately gave us a late checkout - no problem! I highly recommend this hotel!1;5
Wonderful hotel, staff are excellent, very helpful and friendly! They made us feel very welcome. Rooms are very clean and to a high standard. Would highly recommend staying here as it is very central to everything.;5
If visiting New York, please consider the new yorker hotel. Situated in manhattan on 8th Avenue. This hotel is right in the middle of everything. All the major sites are accessible by foot. Pick the right room and your next door neighbour is the empire state building. New York never sleeps but once inside the hotel you get peace and quiet. Decoration is a bit dated but the location far outways that. 24 hr diner in hotel for convenience but many restaurants all around. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Enjoy your trip.;4
We were very happy we chose this hotel. Great view of the city skyline and a very nice and convenient diner. Room was comfortable and clean and staff very friendly and good at their jobs. This location was an easy walk to everything, theater district, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Museums Parks and Shopping. I will stay here from now on. I particularly enjoy older hotels with history and unique character and this hotel offers that with all of the comforts that we expect today.;5
The Wyndham New Yorker was a very good experience.  We stayed three nights during a week’s vacation in New York City.  The New Yorker provided a nice proximity to Madison Square Garden, Macy’s and the Empire State Building.  It’s not a location you would choose for a vacation seeking theatre and Time Square.  The hotel has been updated but does charge a premium for the updates.  Lots of history.  Stop by the history section in the lower level if you have the time during your stay.;4
This hotel is perfectly placed for sightseeing, it’s a short walk to broadway, time square, Rockefeller and the Empire State Building. The staff were friendly and helpful even when busy and there is a lovey relaxed feel about the place. I particularly loved the original Art Deco features which give the hotel a sense of glamour and history.;5
Location, location, location! A short 7-10 minute walk to the Empire State Building (which we visited on a Monday night at 9pm with no queues!), a 15 minute walk to Times Square and Broadway theatres and a subway station right beside the hotel (for longer journeys uptown and downtown). The hotel is lovely, very clean and well-maintained. Spacious room with very comfortable beds and an excellent bathroom (bathrobes provided!). Lots of good places to eat around the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended!;5
A lovely clean well run hotel , From the minute we arrived to moment we left everyone was helpful and friendly, room was kept spotless by housekeeping and nothing was to much trouble. Would definitely stay here again .;5
Had a great night's sleep at The New Yorker Hotel, while attending the Elton John 'Farewell 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' concert at Madison Square Garden! Elton most definitely put on his best show and performance, ever! Also took in Radio City Music Hall's CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR with the Rockettes that morning before seeing Elton John that evening, also saw SCHOOL OF ROCK the night before, which was a great musical play, also written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, as well.;5
I was looking for a centrally located hotel and found this one just across the street from Penn Station. It fully lived up to my expectations. I'll gladly go there again should I be looking for a Midtown location next time visiting NYC.;5
The only saving grace for this hotel is it's location. We travelled by train from Montreal to NYC and this hotel is almost opposite Penn Station. I was previously aware of the 'Facility fee' though Internet research and our travel agent got this removed from our prepaid bill. The hotel say this is a mandatory fee to cover WiFi, phone calls, gym and online check in for airlines. We needed none of these. My wife needed a refrigerator which was $20 but this was waived as it was required for medical reasons. Despite asking for this prior to our stay it wasn't delivered to our room until the second night of our stay. Our room (a twin room) was on the 34th floor. The corridor was dingy and smelt musty as did our room. The room was very small but at least we could move round the beds;1
I generally try to overlook some things when I'm in a NYC hotel (I travel there frequently for work). I know the rooms will be tiny, and there will be street noise. But for a hotel of this rating, brand, and the reviews, I was severely disappointed with the facility.  I opted to try this hotel as it was next door to the building I was working in for the week. Check in was fine - I waited about 10 minutes, but that's not out of the ordinary for such a high volume place. There are a lot of elevator banks, which meant never having to wait too long. But entering the room, I was really surprised at how dated it was. Not only outdated, but also in poor condition. Turning on the sink, it would fill up quickly almost to the point of overflowing while washing my face quickly - the;2
The receptionist was so welcoming.  The hotel is centrally located and very clean.  We also love that the Tic Toc is right there for meals.  The room was spacious.  We didn't have a refrigerator which would be nice.;5
Location is right by Penn station, which is fab for transport. It’s also close to the Empire State Building.  The hotel has 3 restaurants- a 24hr diner, a steak and cocktail place and an Italian. All are amazing! The rooms are small and dated, this is what lets the place down. Disproportionate to the price for the room I felt. However, when I discussed this with guest services, they apologised and sent some complementary wine to the room which I thought was lovely. The staff were really nice.  Overall it was nice, but pricey, then again it’s New York!;4
I stayed here in a suite with my two brothers, my sister-in-law and my mum for 5 days in the October holidays. Below are my scores out of 10 for each area considered important when staying at a hotel...  Staff - 6/10 The staff were not overly friendly but were efficient in their job. There were enough staff on the desk so you were never waiting too long.   Room - 6.5/10 The room was quite spacious, especially for NYC and we had a view stretching to Times Square. There was a fridge, an iron board, two TVs, a dining table and safe. The reason I give it 6.5 is because the room was quite outdated and the bathroom was not very clean upon arrival. There were hairs still in the bath and there were also cracks on the walls. It could do with redecorating but overall, a good room. Despite;4
"It's a big, old hotel in a great location, and it is also a rip off. Yes, it's close to a many great things in NYC, but it's expensive, very expensive for what you are getting. But worst of all, they have a hidden Facility Charge of $30 which is automatically added to your bill if you book through a 3rd party site. When asked about this, the clerk at the desk  said,, ""It covers your free wifi and the gym."" I didn't use the gym and if I am paying $30, then the wifi isn't free. She also said, ""You should have read the small print..."" Well, when a room costs hundreds of dollars a night, seems to me those little extras should be included. Long story short, I said I'd never stay there again. So, beware when you book, and read the small print, if you have an extra five hours to";1
Very good hotel.  We stayed in the Metro Suite (5 adults).  The room was very spacious with large dining table, bed settee and 2 double beds with ensuite and additional bathroom with toilet, wash hand basin and 2 hair dryers.  There was a fridge and a coffee maker which could also be used to make tea which was great.  A safe was also provided in the room.  The room was kept very clean throughout the duration of our stay and clean towels given if required, along with bed change if needed.  The location of the hotel is excellent and within walking distance to Empire State, Rockefellar Centre, Times Square and Grand Central Station.  Also Penn Station across the road along with Madison Square Gardens.  We did not need to use the Subway as we had the New York Pass which offered the;5
Hotel is history it's in the heart of the business and shopping best location for transportation and touring great for group trips business meeting etc rooms are clean and roomy there's space. Lol I would recommend going to State building . Macy's store and try the cellular restaurant they have lovely drinks and food good steak I recommend.;5
The lobby of the hotel was nicely decorated with Art Deco.  The staff was friendly and worked to solve problems.  The rooms were nice, but small.  The location was great and you could see the Empire State Building from the hotel and Madison Square Garden is basically across the street.  The subway is just outside of the building, so it's very convenient to get where you want.;4
After searching for a room in Manhattan, I came across the reviews for the New Yorker, and SO glad I did!! Making online reservations (thru TripAdvisor) was a breeze, check-in on a Sunday afternoon took no time at all. Lynn at the desk upgraded our reservation to a larger room with a view of the Hudson River instead of a view of the next building. The room was spacious and clean, the mattresses are perfect for me, nice and firm. The bathroom was expectedly small and has older fixtures and tile- this hotel has been around for a while- but everything was clean and tidy, a plethora of towels was provided, the elevators are fast and smooth.  One very cool amenity, that is not advertised, is the location of the 74th and Penn Subway Station right across the street- I wish I had known;5
The New Yorker is as close to the hub of NYC as you can get.  Steps away from Madison Square Garden, Penn Station and Macy's Department Store.  If you need anything you can find it in the neighborhood.  The class and elegance of the New Yorker lives on and the legacy of it's heritage brings extra special memories.  It was my 62nd birthday and it was a great weekend getaway.  The staff was friendly, helpful and very accommodating for any and every need.  The rooms are appointed well and the room was larger than expected which is a real perk in NYC.  Highly recommend you consider your next stay in NYC is at the Wyndham New Yorker.  I know it will be my first place to stay on my next visit.;5
The NewYorker hotel by Wyndham was ideal for our needs. We took Amtrak to NYC and the hotel was easily visible from Penn Station. We arrived late morning and our room was ready for early check-in. Subway stations were just across the street and fantastic restaurants were easy walks. Our room was smaller though it had a great view of the Empire State Building Hotel staff was courteous and friendly.  All in all this was first rate.;5
The hotel felt dated and tired. Lots of brown everywhere! In a good location near Madison Square Garden and a few blocks from Times Square. Room was O.K. I guess, good view.   Beware of extra charges!!!! Every room is charged an additional $29 plus tax PER DAY for use of Wi-Fi, the Business Centre and the Fitness Room, whether you use any of the facilities or not. If this charge is not optional (it definitely isn't!!) it needs to be included in the price quoted for the room, when booking.  We felt cheated and it would put us off returning - there is a huge choice of hotels nearby!;3
The location of the hotel was so easy to get to. We took the train from Newark airport to Penn Station which was no bother even with a pushchair. When we arrived at the hotel, the cot was not yet in the room but they promptly brought it to us. The room had only two small double beds so for a family of five. 2AD, 3CH (18,10 & 13weeks) it was a bit tight. The bathtub was very old and had been repainted and the paint was flaking making it look grubby but the water was hot. There were plenty of towels for the whole family but the complimentary shower gel and shampoos etc were not smoke for a party of our size. It was a good job we brought our own. The beds were comfortable and clean despite being in the small side and the staff were friendly enough. All in all it was just somewhere;3
The location of this Hotel is so central it makes it a winner in our opinion. Right in the middle of Manhattan and only a short walk to Times Square and Macy’s. The breakfasts in the Tick Tock diner are immense and set you up for the day. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We had booked a suite as there were 5 of us and we had lots of space including 2 bathrooms which was a bonus. We would definitely stay here again.;5
My husband , my daughter and l stayed in the New Yorker for a week in October and we thoroughly enjoyed and was very pleased with this hotel. We were upgraded to a  corner suite with view of Empire State one side and madison  Square Garden the other side. Our suite was lovely a spacious . A living area with tv  , desk , coffee table and then dining table with a small fridge. The bedroom had two extremely comfy double beds with walk in wardrobe and another tv . The bathroom was slightly dated but everything works perfectly . The shower was super powerful and stocked with basic toiletries and plenty clean towels . But most importantly the room was very very CLEAN !!!! As was the hallways and reception area . All the staff we spoke  with were all very friendly & polite even in;5
Chose the New Yorker for its location as I was taking my son to NYC for his first trip. naturally he was super excited, as would any 13 year old boy. We stayed from the 26/8/18 to 31/8/18. The hotel is situated in a good location close to Macys and having a metro station on its doorstep so you can get around. Check in staff are friendly and have a pleasant manor as they welcome you and process your check in. We had two rooms booked and were given rooms over looking the Hudson next door to each other, which was convenient for meeting when going out. Rooms were a good size and everything worked as it should. Overall we had a great time during our stay and had no problems with the room. On the morning of checkout, there was then usual invoice under the door for the local taxes;1
So, me and 3 friends stayed here on 2 occassions on a recent trip to NYC.  First time was for 3 nights, then we moved to a hotel in Williamsburg and then back for another 2 nights.  We booked a ‘view suite’ so we had 2 double beds and a sofa bed for the 4 of us.   First time - arrived at 7pm... told room was not ready?! Even though check in is at 4pm?! Front desk staff were quite rude, unable to say when the room would be ready, not apologetic at all... Not great after a long flight. Finally checked in at 9pm. Had already emailed in advance and asked for sofa bed to be made up, and asked again on initial arrival at 7pm... got up to the room... sofa bed not made! Took at least an hour for them to come and do it...    The room was fine, clean and reasonably spacious, definitely no;3
Right in the heart of manhattans entertainment with everything accessible by foot. Penn station and Maddison square garden around the corner. Macy’s, Times Square and Empire State less than 10 minutes walk.  Rooms/beds small but very stylish and comfortable- we had a standard queen and got wonderful views of Empire State Building. Tick tock diner great value and the New Yorker is opposite a Mac Donald’s and a great pizza place la famiglia. Wonderful 1920/30’s style throughout. Staff courteous and professional. Rooms cleaned daily. Definitely recommend.;5
Hotel is nice and clean in a perfect location. Restaurant is very good. I specifically asked for a quiet room for the marathon. It is horribly loud. I phoned to ask why so loud and front desk was quite rude. We’ve not gotten much sleep since we’ve been here because of the very loud noise. If you’re a light sleeper, be aware. The first morning we all had a cold shower due to no hot water. Second night there was bad wifi and spent a long time getting it to work with the third parties help. Again, front desk was not friendly. We are still here and I would go talk to them about the troubles but the last two times on the phone they were too rude and they tried to put me to a manager that never did phone me back or answer.  Again, it’s a nice room with comfy beds but with the rude;3
An old Art Deco hotel with lots of character. We were upgraded by Mohammed to a room with a view. Lying in bed looking at the Empire State Building was incredible. Mohammed also gave us vouchers for a complimentary breakfast in the Tick Tock diner. Excellent food. We used the subway a lot and this hotel is in the perfect location to go everywhere. Would definitely stay here again.;5
Whenever I am in New York I stay at the New Yorker Hotel.  it is extremely convenient to Newark airport, penn station, Broadway and the subway system.   A great buffet restaurant around the corner provides a large selection for breakfasts and lunches.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The rooms and hallways are quiet.  The beds are very comfortable.  For me it’s a home away from home.;5
Unfortunately we received confirmation for a different room above the 19th floor. We expected a small room, it is NYC. But we didn't expect a room where you could actually here everything that happened outside. Between the sirens, jack hammering and honking horns there was not one peaceful night. We were too close to the street on the 8th floor with absolutely no view of anything.;2
Just checked out after a lovely 6 day break, Great hotel, great location and staff are very helpful. Had a lovely room with a great view.  Tick Tock diner next door to hotel was a great place to eat breakfast.  Hopefully will return one day;5
The proximity to Penn Station and the subway make it a great choice for easy travel. I've chosen the New Yorker every time I've visited NY over many years. Love the Tick Tock diner and looking forward to trying Butcher and Banker.;4
A good hotel veiw rooms very nice and clean this is a very busy hotel close to Empire State Building and Times Square and buses food is very expensive as any where in New York on a very busy road.some parts of the hotel are a little tired hotel reception staff very helpful we had an upgrade champagne and half price resort fee very nice birthday treat.steak house ok not fantisic like the prices tick tic very nice;5
On our first morning we went to Tick Tock which is a 24 hour diner. Monday morning around 10am it was so busy!  Food delicious and staff work very hard. Service.... they come to you to take order. After food they give you the bill then either pay at counter or pay your waiter with tip of course. Butcher and banker is downstairs and a very classy cocktail bar and small restaurant.  £30 For 2 cocktails but a very unique location being an old bank vault until the 1980s.;4
"OK, so this place is iconic and boasts some undeniably lovely original NY Art Deco touches in and around the lobby. The location for Penn and The Garden is great and if you get, or request,  the right room on a high floor you’ll get a Manhatten or New Jersey view to die for. But it ends there for me.   Firstly it’s vast, by my calculation over 1000 rooms, which results in long lines for the elevators (of which there are 12!) and reception at peak times. Don’t doubt they’re in a constant state of maintenance, but this high footfall also means, the floors themselves and certain aspects of the rooms are shabby; it could do with a refurb in fact.   On my most recent visit my key card kept failing, resulting in 5 minute round trips back down to reception (praying there wouldn’t be a";2
We stayed at the New Yorker for 4 nights last week and it was absolutely first class, which was fitting because we where there to celebrate my daughters 16th birthday.  We were upgraded to a suite which was marvellous, the room was very nice and we had plenty of room. The room was very clean and very welcoming after a day of sightseeing round such a fantastic city.  Having stayed in various hotels over the years I would happily recommend the New Yorker as a place to stay, the location in mid town is ideal for sightseeing with Times Square just a mere 20 mins walk.  We enjoyed it that much that when we return to New York i would definitely stay there again.;5
This is one of our favorite hotels that we've stayed in when visiting NYC.  It is usually our preferred hotel because of the price for a hotel that has a great location with access to everything midtown and a classic Art-Deco design throughout.  We've also always found the staff to be top-notch and always find them accommodating.;5
5th time staying at the New Yorker, my go to hotel when staying in NYC. Have not been back since 2014 & was pleased to see a significant number of upgrades since then.   Hotel is in a great location near the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden & 10 minute walk from Time Square. Numerous subway stations close by. We had a great suite on the 39th floor with a great view down 34th Street towards the ESB. Room clean & spacious. TV in both living room & bedroom.   Hungry? Tick Tock Diner attached to hotel. Go there for a hearty breakfast of pancakes, sausage & bacon (always a treat!).   We’ll be back to NYC & The New Yorker!;5
Great location, and very friendly staff. The hotel is lovely. It is a wonderful way to embrace the city, because  the location puts you close to everything.  Walking distance to Macy's and some of the Historical spots as well. Diners everywhere and even in the bustle of the city I felt safe. I will return. Loved this place.  I had a standard room. which is very small but perfect  for one person. IF you are traveling with someone get an upgraded room.;4
We booked our the suite for our family holiday to NYC which consisted of 2 double beds in the main room and a pull out couch in the living area. Comfortable beds to sleep in. For being a suite I expected the decor and facilities to be a bit better - there was no kettle for a cup of tea which you’d think for buying a room for 2000€ you’d perhaps get that at least. Towels and linen provided which was a bonus. Room smelt a bit damp on arrival.   The cleanliness of the bathroom was extremely poor. First shower I took the curtain was off white and there was black hairs in the bath/on the tiles. Bit off putting and disgusting especially when your in there!!   First night we stayed was a Saturday and on the Sunday morning room service approached our door and walked in at 6.50am!!;3
It was notMy first time in this hotel and as last time I found the hotel getting a bit « old » I booked and prepaid for a Double Executive view room as it was described as « recently renovated room, with renovated bathroom and Nespresso coffe machine in the room »Unfortunately I didn’t get what I paid for, instead I got a Metro room (same as last time) . When I asked at the reception they explained me that this room was bigger than the executive one and then more convenient with my 2 kids.They propose me to bring me a coffee maker , I accepted but it was not a nespresso one ( bad coffe, really) . I asked to see an real executive room but it was not possible as none of them were free ! And they refused to refound the difference price between metro and executive !The bathroom was;2
"Partly chosen because of its proximity to Penn Station (which means a direct train all the way from Newark Airport).  The New Yorker is just across from it - in my best Rizzo accent I crossed the street shouting ""I'm walkin' here"" to the yellow cabs and into the lobby.  We were almost immediately served by the recptionist; she was very friendly and asked if we wanted to upgrade rooms for an extra $22.  The implication was that it was just $22 but I asked the question and it was per night; remember that there is also a 'resort fee' of around $32 per night that you have to pay extra.  I agreed and we went to our room.  The room had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building, but there was a downside... someone else was already in the room.  So, we went back downstairs and spoke";4
I stayed for one night to attend a concert at MSG. So easy to navigate to and from that venue.  The staff was amazing.  Prior to my stay I had to call and the front desk staff was great. I asked to check in early and they accommodated me no problem. Mohamed took great care of me when I needed a roll away bed.  Overall I highly recommend staying here if you are visiting the city. I will again.;5
Upgraded to a larger room  with two queen beds for an extra $23 PER NIGHT... thought it was just $23, till I checked my card. Had a nice view of Empire State Building , rooms were cleaned daily. Bathroom was old and shower bad. Linen was clean and fresh . No room service that I was aware of but there is a 24 hour restaurant. Security is good, and taxis easily available to everywhere including jfk. Starbucks and maccas across the road conveniently. Good central location. An hours walk to Central Park. Very noisy location, mind you I think everywhere in this city would be the same;3
Beautiful executive room with two queen beds, very clean, cleaners so willing to do anything for you. Security staff do an excellent job checking to make certain you are staying  there, each time I went out I was checked on re entering which made me feel safe. All the staff so pleasant. Very good poisition  for Times Square, Empire State Building, Macy just round the corner, Central Park at the end of the Avenue.we were on 8th Avenue. Only used a taxi once in the city to go to Ground Zere 16 dollars, used the subway way back only 5 dollars for the two of us. If you want  good , cheap food go to Essen, couple of minutes walk from the hotel, excellent choice of food, very tasty. For something special Red Lobster Times Square, don’t order a starter if ordering unlimited prawns,;5
I stayed at The New Yorker on 8th Avenue New York City when visiting to attend the AES convention at the Javits Center.  It was very convenient for this as the Convention Center is a short walk away from the hotel.  The hotel is also just a 2 minute walk from Penn Station and also right by the 34th Street Subway Station, making it a very accessible Hotel.  Built in 1929 it has an art-deco feel in places but the rooms are in need of a good refurbishment.  I stayed in room 3305 which had a nice view towards the Hudson River but the room was very tired.  At over US$300 a night for room only I really do expect better standards, hence my 'Average' review rating.  Check-in was very slow and at check-out they only had one person on the front desk.  There are some great restaurants a;3
We chose the New Yorker because it was in an art deco building and we were not disappointed. The front desk staff were great and all around the hotel the building has been well decorated to show the art deco features. The view from our 48th floor suite of the New York skyline just great. Close to a subway station and bus stop - so very easy to get around New York. Our 4 day stay was most enjoyable;5
The New Yorker is a beautiful hotel right in the heart of it all.  It is close to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and Broadway.  I have stayed here multiple times and enjoy the beautiful lobby and and the proximity to all that New York has to offer!  The rooms are a little small, but you will be right near all kinds of things to do.;4
Impressed with the room...small but clean. The staff were very helpful from the get-go. Centrally located...near Penn Station, walkable to all the places we wanted to go. Would definitely return to this hotel. It was very reasonably price for NYC.;4
Our stay at The New Yorker could not have been better. Our premium suite on the 38th floor afforded panoramic views of the city while providing all the comforts one could want. We will definitely be back to The New Yorker!;4
Stayed one night for work. Very convenient to Penn Station. The room was small but it’s NYC so to be expected. Room & bathroom were clean so that’s a huge plus. Connected diner off the lobby which is also a plus when getting in late from a meeting. I would stay here again;4
Just next to the Penn Station and the Madison Square Garden the location is near unbeatable. This is an iconic Art Deco building with a lot of charm. (Must check out their historical archive on display in the basement)   While comfortable, the rooms are showing age and is good time for them to consider renovation.;4
We stayed in this lovely hotel in October. We were delighted with the view but the customer service from Michael and Mohammed was outstanding! We felt like royalty! I would most definitely stay here again. Lovely people made the holiday.;5
This hotel was very centrally located. I had a corner room with a terrific view of 34th Street and the Empire State Building. The room was very small but clean and comfortable. It was a bit costly as most NYC hotels are. I do recommend this facility to all.;4
"The location is one block from MSG and Penn Station so it's the perfect location for easy access to the city.  However, at $240 per night, it was a really small room.  The bed was comfy and it was a nice view, but wish there was more room; especially in the bathroom.  Hats off to Anthony at the Concierge desk for being friendly and attentive to everyone; especially considering how busy he was when I was there.";5
Great location, wonderful hotel, helpful and friendly staff. Love the history of the hotel, and the location to the Tic Toc Diner. Pricing is often high but competetive. Security, although important can seem tedious at times especially when the hotel is busy. All the bathrooms could use an upgrade but overall very happy with the New Yorker.;5
Very comfortable rooms and staff very helpful. Close to major attractions, good location for shopping and restaurants. May need a bit of updating, but certainly clean. USB ports in bedroom clock were very handy.;5
"Great value and convenience if you are attending events at Madison Square Garden. Hotel was built in 1929. It is ""art deco"" and has a classic Tick Tock Diner off the lobby as well as a very nice Italian Restaurant.";4
"Positives: (1) Location if Penn Station is important (2) great little breakfast diner in the Tick Tock (3) art deco if you are into that. Negatives: (1) the day that I was there all reservation systems were down and they could not check in guests until in my case after 6 pm. It was sheer chaos with lines of 50 plus people. Apparently no redundancy in their systems. I had traveled 1500 miles and had a dinner meeting lined up at 6. So that eliminated any opportunity to get into the room. From observation, it seems like the check in process is repeatedly in chaos. (2) they hit you with a $40 per night ""resort fee"" which buys you exactly nothing except access to a fitness facility that is just poor. In my view it just seems like a way to inflate the room rates without being up front";2
Great location and amazing stay as always. Service was impeccable and staff was super-friendly. Haven't stayed here in a few years but it was as great as the last time. Highly recommend staying here when in New York.;5
I could wax lyrical all day and night and still not be able to say how happy I was with our stay in September.  We stayed 3 nights and as it was my partner's first time in New York we asked if we could have if possible a room with a view.  We went for a brief walk to wait for the room to be sorted and when we went back we were not disappointed.  Where else could you get a room where you could see the empire states building from your bed! and view the one tower from the other window.  Then to top it off you could also see the Chrysler building in the distance. My man was made up.  We couldnt tear our eyes from the view each night and early morning dawn over the empire states was just beautiful.  Thank you to the kind receptionist who went over and beyond to make our stay so;5
Beautiful top of the hotel premium suite with panoramic view of Manhattan and the Empire State Building. Historic ambience and highest quality. Perfect pre-cruise location in the heart of midtown with ready access to the subway at Penn Station.;5
Great location get off the train and only a block away  About a 5-10minute walk to time square and all the local attractions  Subway station just outside the doors and a great bagel place a block away  Liberty bagels  Other then the fact the rooms were small everyone there was great hostest;4
Location is everything, this is a great one. Subway station is on the corner and the AEC trains can take you almost anywhere in the city, quickly and cheap. The rooms were extra clean and the cleaning staff for room 888 (10/25-28) was WONDERFUL! The lobby is crazy busy but the staff makes it work, doormen during the stay were great. I was there for business and will defiantly make this my go to Hotel when I am back for fun.;5
From check in to check out everything was smooth. The beds were comfy and the room clean! The Bell staff was great in storing our baggage for both early and for late checkout and very prompt when we checked in getting them to our room.;4
We had a Queen Suite. There was a door onto the roof/balcony to see the City lights. Very enjoyable and most importantly, quiet. The beds are nice and cozy! We borrowed an umbrella from the front desk to use when it started raining.;5
Ok.....so, super small room but I know that going in...and even super smaller bathroom but whatevs  The service:  I just have to rave about how welcome we felt.  Upon our arrival, we met a lovely gentleman at check in. I forget his name but he wears Gucci eyeglass frames.  We were early (1:15 pm) and he was able to secure a upgraded room that was ready for us. He was super personable and very pleasant.  I saw him again when we checked out and the same congeniality and friendliness.....really nice man!  Thanks for being a cool dude!  The doorman on duty Sunday morning, October 28.  Another super friendly and engaging gentleman.  Another cool dude that was fun talking to!    I would not hesitate to stay here in the future.;4
"I spend loads of time in hotels for work and can honestly say there is nothing ""wrong"" with this hotel. The location is fantastic to start with. The rooms are clean, the beds are small but comfortable, the water-pressure in the showers is good and the staff are friendly. Its a massive hotel with very little eye for a ""personal touch"".";3
Arrived at the New Yorker Hotel for a brief, 4 night stay. The hotel is in the middle of Manhatten very close to Penn station. The welcome was warm and friendly and the room comfortable. We dined at the Butcher & Banker restaurant which is in the basement of the hotel Food excellent as was the wine. ( Wine is very expensive in America. You will be lucky to find a bottle of wine in any retardant for less than $60 ) Waiters were attentive and service good. Also tried the Tick Tock diner and Trattoria restaurants. Both very good. But beware the tipping system. Entirely different to the U.K. Tips are often added automatically to the bill. The New Yorker was clean, comfortable and friendlet. Security is good and from its location on 8th Ave & west 34th street. Most attractions are;4
I'm used to travelling a lot, and I'm used to the New York prices too.  So, the price we paid was reasonable if we had a room of a decent size, which we clearly didn't. First, because the room was not ready at noon, we could actually get in at 4PM. Travelling with my wife and 2 young children, we booked a room with 2 beds. We barely could put our 2 suitcases + the baby stroller in the room... and when we did, we had to walk on the beds to go from one side to the bathroom. The beds were small (140cm) and basically: no place at all on the floor. We had a small portable baby crib for our little one, for which there was absolutely no space at all.  The sound isolation is catastrophic: you hear your neighbors go to the bathroom or take their shower, and there was no way to adjust the;1
Came here hopig for nice vacations, but the hotel is just bad. Terrible shower temperature, very hot or very cold and constantly changing on it's own. There's an alarm that was set for 6 am, we never asked for that since it's a holiday trip, when I asked about that they just said that it must have been the previous guest (so how much do they check the rooms between guests?) But it was a lie since it happened again the next day. The worst part is that the bed has a SHARP broken spring that almost cut my leg, fortunately it was just a scratch. Would never come back;1
Although the rooms are small, you can't beat the location, just one block from Penn Station and close to many New York attractions.  My room had a view of the Empire State Building.  The staff were helpful and even agreed to give me an unusually late check-out, which was helpful given the timing of my train travel.  The room was clean and comfortable.;4
· We probably had the best one double suite in the place on the top floor - brilliant views of Empire State, WTC and even the Statue of Liberty. New York is not cheap and this room helped compensate for an otherwise jaded icon as a hotel in a city that is going downhill fast unless the city planners can sort out traffic, rubbish and social problems  · Location in central Manhattan is great on paper.... the reality is that Manhattan is not a romantic stay- the traffic is horrendous and constant noise from emergency service sirens to make a way through it only stops in the small hours- rubbish is piled every 50 yards on the pavements on all the main streets/avenues in bags for the nightly collections. There is a massive homeless and vagrant problem evident all around with rough;3
"The great thing about The New Yorker is the location. Right in midtown, you can easily reach most of Manhattan's ""must see"" spots, as well as being conveniently placed for shopping. The hotel also has the fantastic Tick Tock 24 hour diner which is great for breakfast.   Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.   The second we stepped out of the lift and saw the dull brown depressing corridors, we nearly turned back.  Our room was tiny. A corner room with two queen beds, there was literally no space to move around the room, let alone store a suitcase! The decor was old and tired, the TV didn't work at all and the bathroom looked like something from an old movie.   Under no circumstances would I ever return to this hotel again. There are so many choices in Manhattan - do";2
This is the first time my family and I have stayed in the iconic New Yorker hotel. We cannot wait to come back.  Easy check in with such brilliant staff and caring. I wasn't feeling to great after the flight into Newark and rather than have us waiting we were able to check in early. How wonderful and customer orientated is that?!  Our room was on the 28 floor and it had a great view of Madison square garden.  The housekeeping staff are all super friendly and always said hello when we saw them and always asked if there was anything we needed. The rooms were spacious ,extremely clean and it takes you back to old style new york. The beds were comfy and with plenty of space.  The location of the hotel is closer to things than we realised. You have Macy's down the road,Penn station;5
This was my second visit to the Wyndham New Yorker, my first being in February of last year with friends, this year however I took my Mum for her first trip to New York for her 60th! I couldn't fault this hotel at all. Has the nicest staff ever so helpful! Super central to attractions, subway and bus terminal. Has great facilities as well but the only one we made use of was the Tick Tock diner which is lovely! The rooms were clean and had the comfiest beds ever! On arrival we were upgraded to a city view with 2 double beds and opposed to 1 as I had let them know of my mum's birthday prior to arriving so I'm thankful that they managed to do something memorable for us. I'm already looking into my next visit I love it! Realised I never took pictures of the room but I do have one of;5
Stayed here on Wyndham points over a long weekend. We'll start with the Pros: great location right next to a metro station and Madison Square Garden, easy walk to many key points in midtown Manhattan (though countless hotels can boast this), good Italian restaurant and bar on site, in the room shower was hot and strong, WiFi reliable, historic exhibits about the hotel's early years were nice to see.   The Cons: We've stayed in Manhattan many times in recent years and this hotel had the smallest room and bathroom we've ever seen, even for NY hotel standards. The remodeled room was perfectly nice in design, but I wish the architect had configured the bathroom to be just a bit bigger, as you could barely open the closed door while inside.   The hotel is enormous, and the foot;3
Hotel was just that, a hotel. Its advantage at the time was its location,  close to Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, The Javitz Centre and a short walk to Times Square. No call out on special service or anything. Nothing to rave about nor nothing to complain about. Rooms were smaller than expected,  with 2 queen beds, not much space for 3 or 4 suitcases.;3
A really good location and some great views from my 23rd floor room! I was commuting from Manhattan to Newark each day and, with the hotel being a 2 minute walk to Penn station, it was the perfect spot.  Additionally, it’s close to lots of shopping, within 10 minutes of Time Square and a short subway ride into downtown.  Only slight reservation of the hotel would be that the rooms are a bit small and I would have appreciated a small fridge in the room for my water.;4
I came here for my birthday/Independence Day and was not disappointed , the hotel staff were very nice and we didn’t have any problems. The actual rooms are of a very high quality even though we didn’t get one of the higher tier rooms. There is also a nice underground location talking about the history of the hotel which was a nice addition. The lobby is beautiful and the Tick Tock Dinner , practically inside the hotel , provided great food , maybe a little expensive. The hotel can be seen from around the beautiful city with the famous sign standing out. The hotel is at a great location as it’s only a short walk from a lot of the main attractions in central Manhattan such as the Empire State Building. There were a few minor down sides such as the poor view from a lot of the;4
The Wyndham Rewards loyalty program’s  generous point system enabled me to justify an impetuous decision to travel from Maine to New York City for the Half-Earth Day program at the American Museum of Natural History.  I used one free night (15,000 points) and another 3000 points to reduce the price of a two-night stay at this landmark hotel to around $140.    The New Yorker hotel turned out to be an easy 6-block walk from Penn Station (40th St) along 8th Avenue to 34th Street. Entrance to the subway system (E, A and C lines) is right outside the hotel’s front door.    Wyndham members have their own check-in desk at the New Yorker, which sped up my registration if not access to the room, an un-expected upgrade for which I chose to wait as it was still being cleaned at 4:00 pm.;4
Loved staying at the New Yorker, and loved the amazing view!  Would stay there again, in a heartbeat. The view in the 35th floor facing, The Empire State Building was incredible.  Having many train stations located close by, made my arrival, my stay and my departure very accessible.;5
The New Yorker is a huge hotel of 1050 rooms which had me scared when I entered the huge and busy lobby. No need to have been scared as all the staff were helpful, concerned and very pleasant. Whilst our room was small it was spotlessly clean. The shower had great pressure, which was definitely lacking in the previous hotel we were in! We would be happy to stay at The New Yorker again.;4
Very nice hotel. Close to MSG. Very helpful staff. Tick Tock Diner on site. Room was very clean. Good view. Easy walk to Empire State Building and Times Square. Valet parking was easy. Wyndham Rewards have a good discount.;5
The location of this hotel is fantastic. A block away from Madison Square Gardens, down the street from Empire State Building and Macy's and just around the corner from the subway entrance. Highly recommend staying at this location for the views and for the history! Also the room had great water pressure and hot water for being on the 34th floor. Ask for directions from the information desk and they were very helpful even provided a map and which subway to ride.;5
The New Yorker was a beautiful hotel, spotlessly clean, and perfectly located! Penn Station NY is right down the street, and Time Square was an easy walk. We were able to get everywhere we wanted to go, including stopping by our room to drop things off or change without feeling like we were wasting a bunch of time. Also, the view from our room was wonderful! I couldn't be happier with our experience!;5
A good hotel near to Penn Station and Subway which makes getting around very convenient. Staff were very friendly and helpful at check in and throughout my stay. Good internet access in the room and a comfy bed gave me what i needed for work and rest.  One negative was the shower temperature which was difficult to control.;4
Clean, quiet, except for the occasional sirens...I would definitely stay here again. Good security, staff was helpful and eager to please. We didn't dine on site this time but would in the future. Great bagles around the corner on W34th.;4
The only reason I am marking this hotel as average instead of poor is because the management was nice enough to upgrade our room for no additional cost when we were first placed in an EXTREMELY old hotel room/floor. From what I can tell, half the building (or less) is renovated while the other half is not. They typically charge more per night to be on the renovated floors which is ridiculous given how much the non-renovated rooms already cost. The non-renovated floors look like old office buildings and the rooms are unacceptable with the faucets making loud noises, etc. I would not recommend staying here unless you are willing to spend more to make sure you have a renovated room. The area is good if you want easy access to penn station but because of that is extremely busy and;3
The New Yorker is a great standard hotel for a short stay in Manhattan. Like most hotels in central Manhattan the rooms are small but if you’re traveling with a small group or a single it’s a great option. The hotel is very old with lots of character and plenty of Art Deco remnants left. The rooms are a little dated but always clean. I would recommend it for a quick business trip or weekend holiday.;4
This hotel is in the ideal location. It is right next to Madison Square Garden/Penn Station and within a 15 -20 min. Walk to the theaters. We were on the 7 floor with a nice view of the Empire State Bldg.    Rooms were spacious although the closet was a little odd shaped. The shower was great - mega pressure. Black out drapes on the Windows were a nice touch. Liked that there were 2 restaurants attached to hotel.  Would definitely recommend this hotel for short stays in NYC.;5
Fantastic location close to to the train station and the Empire State Building. The hotel is an Art Deco building that has character but in need of a coat of paint in places. The room was very small but clean the bathroom was functional and the bed comfortable. This hotel is an excellent base for a short break we managed to most of the sights on foot, only using the underground once to get to the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and Ground Zero. We had planned our holiday well as we wanted to see as much as possible in only four days, but on the few occasions we needed to ask for advice we found some of the hotel staff as well as the staff at a couple of places we visited ignorant, rude and unhelpful. This is not something that we encountered in LA or San Francisco on the same;3
I love this gorgeous art-deco lady. Everything I need, incredible location and great price. The staff is great and the rooms evocative of another time with all modern conveniences. I stay here each time so come to Manhattan...my home away from home.;5
"Unfortunately the reservation system for check-in was down so they couldn't issue any room keys.  The result, spending 45-60 minutes in line to check-in only to find out you can't get a room key.  Had to fill-out a sheet of paper with info and they write down the time, and say they will call you in the order that people ""checked in"".  Sat around for 1.5 hours, checked the expected time for me as I saw people showing up after getting ""the phone call"" that checked in around the time I did.  They said they were working close to my time.  I had a broadway show to get to, so had to leave.  At the show, never receiving a phone call about my room, I called during intermission, finally getting through to front desk, and was told yes the system is working and I can get my room key";4
We were visiting to celebrate graduation from school, birthday and family time and New York was our choice of holiday.  This hotel location was amazing- central to most attractions and actually we walked almost everywhere!  Staff were accommodating and when I mentioned the reason for our trip, they offered to upgrade us... unfortunately they ‘upgraded’ us to a higher floor, but less facilities and very old room. The view was really good though!  We asked if they could change us to another room, but there was nothing available and our first room which was actually nice was taken by another.  The staff genuinely tried to help.. but I was a little bit disappointed.  One other thing was that hotel is being used for student accommodation, although it didn’t bother me too much... in;4
I want to start by apologizing to the employees of this hotel - if it were based on them only this rating will be a 5 plus.  Every employee that we encountered throughout this hotel were friendly, welcoming and seemed to enjoy their job.Three stars for the physical condition of the hotel & rooms.  I understand this is an older property but older doesn't have to mean run down and dirty.  Hallways had dirty in the corners, air vents in the room had tons of dust, the couch in our room was stained and filthy, crumbs in the drawers of the desk. etc. etc.  This property could use a major deep cleaning and replacement of furniture.  We had a suite room with a balcony which was awesome but the wind just blew through the balcony door.  That is an easy fix as well.  I am disappointed in;3
We had an amazing view! Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was nice and clean, it was a good size. The bathroom was small and dated but water pressure was great. They made my daughters bday stay very special with a plaque on the door with her name on it.     We'll be back!;5
My wife & I stayed here for 9 nights & didn’t have a problem.  This was our first time in NY but by the middle of our stay, it was clear the location of this hotel was convenient, with Penn Station & many major attractions within walking distance.  All the front desk, reception & concierge staff we had contact with were friendly & efficient, as was the daily housekeeping service.  Because it was our anniversary we were kindly looked after with an upgrade, so enjoyed views of the Empire State & Chrysler buildings from our room.  We are happy to recommend The New Yorker.;4
We were here to accompany our son-in-law's choir performing at Carnegie Hall. We reserved a suite to be able to host the family for this event. The suite was very spacious for NYC. The hotel was very well located. The dining and amenities were excellent for our needs. The lobby was a bit crazy at times, but the staff was excellent at directing traffic.;4
Our first visit to New York and we were delighted with the location of this hotel. 10 min walk to Times Square, 3 min to Madison Square gardens, and 5 min Penn Station.  This is a huge hotel, we stayed on 36th floor, lots of lifts, no delays and check in was efficient with friendly staff. Room was clean, functional and had everything we required (views were a bonus).  We didn't include breakfast which seemed very expensive, instead preferred to try a few city locations for this each day, this worked out great for us, with a number of great diners and cafes within 10 min walk.  Have stayed in Wyndham Berlin previously and again we were not disappointed. It's not necessarily cheap, but we felt the price was worth it and we will definitely go back again next time.;5
Be warned that this is an old hotel and the rowdy people next-door to us might as well have been in our same room. Additionally our room smelled like moldy cat urine. My husband declares that this is “just New York” I think for the outrageous price we paid a room should smell much better. Also the rooms are extraordinarily tiny again this is probably just a New York thing but it bears mentioning. I will say that if you were in town to attend anything at Madison Square Garden the location can’t be beat. There is also a creepy McDonald’s across the street and two Starbucks within eyeshot. Also very convenient to Penn station.;3
We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights after visiting family.  On arrival there was a queue at the check in desk, however, Mohammed took us over to a separate desk and checked us in. His service is impeccable, he upgraded our room to one on a higher floor with a fabulous view of the Empire State Building..wow!  The hotel is ideally placed for and within walking distance of Penn Station, Madison Square Gardens, Macy’s and Times Square. We used the gray line tour bus which was good and enabled us to see all the sights.  We ate in the on site Italian restaurant, this was a good meal and they made a decent cocktail as did the bar in The Banker restaurant. Our only disappointment was when we had a lunch in the Tic toc diner, on paying our bill, the waiter actually asked for a large tip,;4
1/2 block from Penn Station, if you are taking the train.  Very convenient. I have stayed here many times.  Always clean.  Check in is slow, there is usually a line. Rooms usually not ready till after 4 PM but they will let you check your luggage, so you can get your visit started.;5
Plus is very centralMinus we paid extra for a room with a bath- the bath was really old with parts rusty and other parts of the tiles on wall broken. Not worth spending extra in that.Staff were helpful but sometimes very noisy.Hotel is old and needs refurb;2
Concierge was the best. Check out the tick rock restaurant in lobby for 24 hour breakfast and bagels. Felt safe with security at elevator. Room was smaller than most And basically had room to walk around the bed and get into bathroom. Bathroom old and paint on woodwork was peeling. For the location it was ok and it does have the Art Deco feel.;3
The New Yorker is in a prime location to walk to all the main attractions. Walking distance to Times Square, Macy’s, Broadway, Chelsea Market, Little Italy and Chinatown.  You can store you luggage for free if you get there early before your room is ready and want to expire the neighbourhood.  It costs a small fee to store your luggage after checkout if your flight isn’t leaving yet.  About $50 USD uber ride from LaGuardia. The room we had was on the smaller side and had an older character to it.  It was clean and had a closet, safe, hairdryer, and the bed was comfortable. Lots of places to eat (eg. NY style Pizza) nearby. Street food vendors everywhere including hot dogs and fresh fruit stands - at really reasonable prices. We only stayed 3 nights, so we wanted to be able to;4
First visit to NYC, stayed in New Yorker for 6 days. Check in 4pm but hubby started vomiting whilst sitting in Lobby waiting on room. Upgraded to first room avail which was exec double. Lovely fresh spacious room, coffee machine, quiet area on 32nd floor. Staff are all lovely and approachable. Handy to have a diner and restaurant attached to hotel. Very central to Times Square, MSG, ESB, Penn Station, Macy’s.  McDonalds & Starbucks over the road. Housekeeping left room spotless. Would happily stay there again and highly recommend.;5
This hotel was exceptional. Great service, nice rooms, an amazing view of the empire state Building and lots of history. We were in the middle of everyrhing, close to sub way crossings, and could easliy walk to time square. You can catch a cab if walking isnt your thing... but its not that bad. We loved the hotel and will be back soon!;5
Location excellent for subway especially if you work out which access to use. Also easy walk to times square or amtrak. Rooms are nice . We were lucky to be given a larger one. Staff helpful. Unfortunately I think the double bed was smaller than average.;4
Location is great. Close to penn and metro stations with walking distance to Port authority, times square and other highlights. Room was surprisingly big compared to what we expected from Manhattan. Hotel looks a bit old trying to keep working. But… The hotel is very expansive and not so welcoming. We were 2 families traveling together. We arrived before checkin time and found our room ready. Our family companion room was not ready (no offence about that) so they had to stand in a very long not welcoming line in order to put their luggage.  The building has 12 elevators. 6 for 2nd-20th floor and 6 for 20th-40th floor. We had a room on the 19th floor. Some floors between 3rd floor and 17th are not used by the hotel. They are used as offices, foundations, dormitories so the people;3
This hotel is a bit dated but it was very clean. The rooms are small. I was alone in my room but think it would have been a bit tight if I was with someone. There is not much room for your suitcase. I kept putting mine on the bed and would zip it up and store it on the floor. The air conditioner could have been colder but that is because I like a cold room to sleep in (approx 65F/18C).  The shower was great. Lots of pressure and hot water. The location was pretty good. It was close to Macy's but a bit of a walk to Times Square and Broadway. Also, a hike to Central Park and the Rockefeller Center. I am older and I was able to walk to all these places. Empire State Building was a bit closer to walk to. It is right by Penn Station (almost next door) and Madison Square Gardens.;4
We loved this hotel so much we have booked again for October 2018. Really excited to go back.  We were so impressed with the New Yorker it is now our Hotel of choice for any visit to the wonderful NYC. Next week I will be looking at dates for next year too! We arrived at Newark Airport and not too sure how to get to Manhatten we discovered that there is a bus to 42nd Street which is less than ten minutes walk to the New Yorker and conveniently stops right outside Carlos Bakery so we treated ourselves to a wonderful but overpriced cake. It just had to be done. At check in we were looked after by the infamous Mohammed. He is the most efficient, professional and very friendly gentleman. He organised a coffee machine for our room and gave us an upgrade on our room even though it was;5
I really enjoyed my recent trip to New York for business. Upon check-in, Mohammed was fantastic! He not only checked me in and provided me a room with a view of the city lights (which I was really hoping for), but he quickly checked-up on me once I made it to the room to make sure all was good. When I shared one minor thing that I saw in the room, he immediately had it taken care of!  Mohammed was wonderful to work with and he truly made my visit to New York fantastic! The New Yorker is right in the center of all the city action, so it was a perfect location! I can't wait to come back!;5
Great hotel with friendly staff who were very willing to help with anything that we asked.  Fab location close to Macy's and The Empire State Building. We were upgraded to a room with a beautiful view when I told them we were on honeymoon.;4
May seem reasonable for a room rate BUT- after you check out, surprise a host of extra fees and they hold security money for 5-7 days. Id suggest, go to a reputable hotel chain that doesnt try to hide the cost.;1
"My wife and I wanted to stay overnight in Manhattan after spending a few days on Long Island visiting family.  We booked through Hotwire (the mystery 4-star hotel...) and we're ""assigned"" to the New Yorker.  So here's my thoughts on this hotel:  Check in:  Starts at 4:00 but we arrived around 11.  We were given the option of paying for early check in ($50.00) which we were willing to do at that time.  We were given a room on the 25th floor which had a pretty decent view of the Empire State Building.  Room:  If you've read any of the other reviews I'm sure you've picked up on that they are small.  And small was an understatement.  Hell, even the front desk clerk mentioned that the room was on the small side.  We had a queen bed and there was just enough room to move around it.";4
I stayed here whilst attending New York Comic Con. It was a fantastic location being literally across the road from Madison Square garden, a short walk away from Times Square and a subway entrance just outside.  The staff were all friendly and extremely helpful even when we locked ourselves out of our room! We’d had quite a few packages delivered to the hotel, these were easy to collect and again the staff were lovely.  The room was small but more than big enough for the 2 of us, it was clean and practical. The only downside was the water temperature in the shower had a mind of its own and frequently fluctuated. Other than that it was a great place to stay. I would defiantly stay here again;4
Always clean and fairly quiet, this location is right in the heart of Times Square and the theatre district.  Rooms are nicely appointed and never disappointing.  Sadly they removed the revolving lounge overlooking Times Square years ago, but it's still a nice cocktail lounge for drinks and a munch.;4
The rooms are modest, and even their newly remodeled areas show a slight lack of polish, but this is made up for by truly exceptional customer service.     We arrived around noon, (check-in is at 4:00) and were offered complimentary baggage checking until our room was ready.  Once we checked into our room (we requested a nice view, and they made sure to give us one) we noticed that a patch of carpet near the bathroom was soaking wet.  We reported that to the front desk, and they sent someone up within a few minutes to assess the problem.  The staff member was profusely apologetic for the inconvenience and assured us they would find a solution.  Less than five minutes later, we were called by guest services and offered an upgraded room (it was a busy weekend, and the hotel was;5
We arrived exhausted from the Middle East and were so grateful for a bed we didn’t really focus on how small our room was until the next day when the money we were paying didn’t equate to the size of the room. Luckily, after speaking to reception a MUCH larger room was found which was brilliant.  A great spot for walking from and fair value for money for nyc. The diner downstairs was a typical ny diner which was great to experience. Breakfast fast and good.;4
We checked in after 23 hours travelling to find that there was someone already in our room. They had just checked in also. Went back down to the lobby and received keys to a different room to find the room was so small that we could only walk around the bed if the other stepped into the cupboard! We were so tired we couldn’t be bothered complaining. The next day we were contacted to see if the room was ok, so we took the opportunity to say we were not happy. The staff member was fantastic and straight away organised a different room, much bigger and more comfortable. Not an ideal start. The history of this hotel is interesting, the staff were very pleasant and the location opposite penn station is great. All in all it worked out in the end.;3
We had a bit of a bug issue in our Airbnb but we have the New Yorker hotel to thank for making the rest of our New York stay AMAZING! The staff at this hotel are phenomenal. They got us into a room later that day and were incredibly nice and helpful. We were so lucky to find this hotel on such short notice and very thankful that this hotel was so amazing. Mohammad helped us check in to our room and was very nice and made sure the room met our expectations. We also got a call from the hotel manager the day before check out asking about our stay and I had nothing but great things to say. If you are looking for a hotel that is central to all the great New York sites, this is the hotel for you. FLAT OUT AMAZING!!!!;5
My favorite hotel in New York.  A respite from the crowded street below, my stay at the New Yorker was, once again, excellent in every way.  From the friendly staff throughout the hotel to the excellent accommodations, the New Yorker does not disappoint. Simply the best in all respects.;5
Great Customer Service Thank you to Mohammed in Guest Services for looking after us at check in. Not only we got an early check in but also upgraded us to a room with a view of The Empire State Building.  It has made our holiday in NYC more memorable and would definitely would come back & stay here again. Mohammed is very kind & lovely to deal with.   Mant thanks again.;5
I stayed here for one night.   Pros: Superb location, good bed, great view from the 33rd floor, friendly staff, free wifi, bathroom reasonably clean.  Cons: long lines to check in and out, no fridge, very small room, bathroom outdated. Ok for a solo traveller like me but too cramped for a couple.   I would stay here again for a single night, but would look elsewhere for a longer stay.;3
"I get it. It's New York and it's an old building. The way I look at it, I was paying for its great location. Otherwise, it was way overpriced for a small and very outdated room. Do a quick search for ""small"" or ""tiny"" then you'll see I'm not alone in my assessment. Staff was friendly but check in was a bit slow. Cleaning service was good. I was by myself for a conference, so this place worked fine. When I visit NYC with family next time, I'll definitely look elsewhere to get better bang for the buck. Felt like I was staying at a red roof inn - which I like on my road trips quite a bit - just with a much smaller room.   I saw the automatic response from the hotel on other average and bad reviews about how they'll investigate the issue. LOL, you don't know how small and dated";3
We needed to book a hotel that is near Times Square but not as extravagant as the ones located in the central Midtown Area so this was a good option for us. We could easily reach Times Square and Broadway within 10 - 15 minutes with no trouble. There is a Mcdonald's and a Starbucks right opposite to the hotel (some sketchy people here and there at night). The lobby was spacious and had an ATM along with a concierge. The employees were very efficient as the lady who checked us in was amazing, her name was Rachael. The guy who checked us out was also a lot of fun and extremely nice, I forgot his name he was a chubby guy who dressed like a hipster who was on the early morning duty on the 3rd of September.  My main issue with the hotel is that it was a bit dated but I gave it the;4
The hotel is in a perfect location on 8th Avenue, with roughly a 10 min walk to Times Square and the Empire State Building. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful during our stay, nothing seemed too much trouble. The hotel is slightly outdated and in need of modernisation, however it was clean and tidy so we couldn’t complain!!;4
Overall stay and impressions of the hotel are great. Beautiful and clean. Easy access to subway, lots of places to eat and shop all around the location. I like the security of having to show your key to get past the lobby or to use any of the facilities downstairs. I felt very secure and safe.;4
I had one of my worst hotel experiences at the New Yorker Wyndham Hotel. The only positive aspect of that hotel is the very nice housekeeping staff. The front desk has very poor customer service and does not seem to care for the guests needs or requests at all.  The rooms also vary considerably. There is a part of the hotel that has not been remodeled which has absolutely awful rooms. Although, there were two of us, we were given the smallest room in the hotel, just over 100 square feet.,with a tiny bathroom. Looking at the floor plan on the door, we could see that our room was 1/2 the size of all the other rooms on the floor and was the only one that size. When I asked the next day to change the room, I was told that if there was another room, it probably wouldn't be available;1
Stayed here for a weekend trip to NYC. Best location as you are close to MSG and Times Square. Old historic hotel that has been updated and provides wonderful service. Well worth the cost. After all you are in NYC!;5
The  New Yorker, is a fantastic hotel, clean,comfortable, friendly and knowledgable staff. My husband and I fancied Chinese one night but prefered to go to a restaurant where the local people eat. The receptionist gave us an address which the cab driver hadn’t even herd of but found it ok for us, all I can say is it was a no frills restaurant and only locals in there but the best Chinese I have ever had. Without the receptionist we would never have found this restaurant. However, the restaurant has now closed down due to the owner retiring. We would recommend the hotel to anyone. I did have a WOW moment when we first walked in as it was like stepping back in time. One word FANTASTIC.;5
This hotel is perfectly situated in the middle of everything..close to Broadway and times square, next to Madison sq garden, walking distance to the empire state building, and right around the corner from penn station, where you catch the subway.  Restaurant in the hotel is also very good.  Thought it was a bargain for the price given the location.;5
Have stayed here twice. The location of the hotel is perfect. 15 min walk from time square. MSG and the empire state building are just round the corner. Would highly recommend this hotel. The staff are very helpful, they have a concierge service available. The tik tok diner attached to the hotel is also very nice.;4
In my opinion as a travel agent this hotel should be higher than 4 star!  Only a 10 minute walk from Times Square, 15 min walk from Empire State and across the road from Penn Station.. this hotel is in an excellent location!  We arrived by taxi from the airport and upon arrival were taken aback at how grand the lobby was with the chandelier and spacious lounge area. It didn't take long to check in and we were upgraded to an executive room which was great with 2 double beds, 2 wardrobes, coffee machine, table and chairs and a safe. Our room was very quiet and we didn't hear any noise.;5
5 nights marvellous stay in this remarkable historical hotel in a comfortable and clean large bedroom, near Pennsylvania Station providing many connections to any directions, especially airports. Moreover, we had an amazing view from our 29th floor room. We guess that it is recommended to ask for higher floor rooms.;5
After 52 years went back to New York and stayed at the same hotel. After a makeover the hotel still has the art deco look that makes it unique. Welcomed by courteous professional staff who made checking in a breeze. Great central location with all the facilities you need including a diner and restaurant. Small rooms a tight squeeze with luggage etc. A great stay.;5
"The New Yorker a Wyndham Hotel is well staffed with professional, courteous service at every turn.  The hotel has an ambiance of old elegance and class and  it's location is superb for easy access to all points in New York City's five boroughs. Of course, Pennsylvania Station, Madison Square Garden, Macy's, Times Square, Broadway and that ""manhattan energy"" add to the ambiance of the location .";5
Booked a double room for two nights, the room was not big enough for one person with luggage let alone two people. The bathroom was tiny with no shelves by the sink to put shaving/toothbrushes on. the shower controls looked as if they had come from the local museum, we were on floor 20 and the view looked straight across to other bedrooms not 25ft away so had to keep curtains closed. If you do decide to stay there please check your room first.;3
This is a historic hotel located centrally in Manhattan. We had a 11 days stay and it was very comfortable. The hotel needs a renovation especially in the rooms and bathrooms but it was very clean and the staff was great and very responsive to our needs. The building is iconic and you feel the real experience of New York there. I strongly suggest to try the Tick Tock breakfast place and the Banker and Butcher restaurant for excellent steaks.;5
Supposedly a premium hotel, so we expected better...  The rooms are non-smoker, but ours smelled musty, and there must have been smokers there before us.  The air conditioner fan was so noisy, we had to turn it off to sleep.  The shower controls are ancient with no temp control, and I would be boiling one second, freezing the next, and then boiling again.  On the day we were leaving, the maid just walked in on us at 9AM. One knock, then used the key and walked in. No calling in. No verifying that we had not yet checked out.  She saw us naked, but that was her problem. She had no business coming in at that hour, let alone unannounced when we were checking out 3 hours later.  The location is excellent. That is about the only positive thing I can find to write... :(;3
I currently have medical needs. I had requested early check in but understand it’s not guaranteed, so no big deal that my room wasn’t ready when I checked in. They took my cell number ( which I double checked was the right number) to text me when I checked in. 5 hours later, no text. Go back to the front desk to ask about my room and they say my room is ready to check into. NEVER received a text, why bother to take my number and promise to do so.  I needed a refrigerator in my room for medical reasons. I called in the morning to confirm it was in the notes that it was for a medical reason. They confirmed. Checked again when I checked in later. They said yes no problem. Got to my room, no refrigerator. Called downstairs to ask, they said they’d send it right up. 40 mins later I;1
We spent six nights in this hotel. Thanks a lot to Mohammed at the check in desk, who gave us a free upgrade to a room on the 19th floor with a great view to the Empire State Building. The rooms are not that big, but decent for Manhattan, clean and they have everything you need. Got a coffee maker on request to the room with a decent selection of coffee and tea. Penn Station is across the street and the Tic Toc diner on the corner has ok food. Be sure to visit Pizza Suprema close by for some great NY style pizza. All in all, a very good vacation for a family of four.;5
The New Yorker has the good reputation of an excellent located hotel. The fact that it is right next to the Penn Station helps with train travellers (or tourists that come from JFK airport like us).  Very good staff service.  The room was particularly small, no kettle for coffee or tea.  Excellent view!;4
Mohammed was so helpful. He was the most amazing concierge we’ve ever had. I want him to be there every time. Mohammed was so awesome. I will stay here every year if he is here. I have never had so much help.;5
The hotel was very conveniently located to Penn Station, with a short walk to the theatre district.  The room was clean and sufficient for our needs.  Staff and security were excellent.  The adjourning Tick Tock Diner was a great place for breakfast and late night dining.;5
This is the third time I stayed at the New Yorker. I love the Art Deco architecture, the nostalgic and at the same time cosy, friendly and homely atmosphere. The staff takes care of you, seeks to really ensure you have a great stay. The location is hard to beat, conveniently located near Penn Station, Port Authority and C line. Walking distance from downtown and uptown, closer to the High Line. Macey's, Times Square, Madison Square Garden all just a short walk away. The rooms are a decent level of comfort, good size beds, sufficient space in the room and bathroom.;4
Super location. Delightful original 1930s hotel. Very helpful and friendly staff, especially one delightful lady on the reception desk who gave my boys and I a SUPERB room. Thank you so very much! It was very large and had an amazing view towards the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. We were on the 33rd floor. It was amazing. The Italian Resturant was excellent, as was the Diner. Beautiful grand entrance too. Would definitely recommend and would love to return.;5
I, unfortunately, had a family event and it was the UN General Assembly week and they had doubled the rates.  The room was about 12' by 11' and you had to go outside the room to change an idea.  The lamp on the desk had a plug but it would not hold the connection for the iPhone charger. The bathroom shower was the only good thing about the room if you did not mind the wait for hot water and you like strong showers.    The positive was the staff was very nice.  There are many cheaper places to eat in the area Food at the hotel was about average.;3
The most greatest part is the location. Very convenient and safe to walk in town. Room is small since it's in the heart of NYC there's nothing to complain about it. Service was okay, a bit slow but average.;3
This is a wonderful property in the heart of the City and near everything. Clean, well staffed and accommodating .. We enjoyed our stay very much. The room was clean and well stocked with a Keurig matching and plenty of Dunkin K-cups. Bathroom stocked with towels and amenities.;5
On 8th Avenue & 34th street the Art Deco hotel still has the authentic feeling of a 1930's building. The check in is quick a smile from the receptionist would have been nice!! The rooms are of adequate size with very comfortable double beds. There are a lack of accessible power sockets as some have been capped off. The bathroom has an excellent shower. A good range of meals are available at the Tick tick dinner. The situation of the hotel is great with Penn station, Macey's department sore just around the corner and Time Square a short walk away.;5
Great shows in town.  And the take home wine glasses will always bring back for memories!  We signed in for breakfast in the special room they have!  Loved all the fresh fruit! Would go back to New York in a minute if only to see my goddaughter!;5
Featured in How I Met Your Mother, I was curious to see if this iconic hotel was in fact visited by ghosts of the past. After visiting its museum, you came away with the feeling that you were staying in a place that was a part of history.  The service was exceptional, the rooms modernized, even if mine was a bit small. As I was in NYC for a writing conference, just being there got me into a creative frame of mind. Overall, it was a legendary experience!;5
Very pleased with a recent stay at the New Yorker Hotel. The staff were all very pleasant and accommodating. The room was beautiful - 30th floor with great views and a very comfortable bed. The food in Trattoria Bianca was outstanding and for the BEST eggs benedict in NYC the Tick Tock Diner is fantastic! I highly recommend this classic landmark NYC hotel for your next visit.;5
I have always wanted to stay at The New Yorker because it is so iconic (make sure you check out their mini museum in the lower level)...and the fact that Mr. Tesla died there.  The hotel is a grand old girl so remember that when you book.  Some of the rooms are smallish, but I was so fortunate to get room 3327 with a fantastic view and a separate sitting area.  I have to rave about my check in experience.  I was super tired from driving from Florida so maybe Jessica took pity on me and gave me an excellent room.  She was so professional and lovely to deal with.  I actually complemented her about how she handled the couple who were in line before me because they were quite rude to her about something in their life they didn't like but she kept her professional and pleasant;5
The hotel had beautiful views. Inside the hotel was clean and really quite beautiful. The room was plenty big enough for three of us and was very comfortable. The hotel is centrally located and close to everything. The staff was friendly and welcoming. We would highly recommend this hotel, and we will be back!;5
Stayed for 5 nights in September. The service couldn't be faulted, we arrived a couple of hours before check in time, after 14 hours travelling, so i asked at the desk if we could get into a room early. Not only did they let us into the room they found us one on the 36th floor with a stunning view.  The room was fairly small but had two double beds, and was manageable with three adults. The room was clean, beds comfortable and the shower worked, which is all we needed really. There are no coffee / tea making facilities and no fridge which would be the one point they could improve on. The Bar is Atmospheric evenings and great to sit up and watch people go by, but expensive. (4 glasses wine $48). The Tick Tock Diner joined to the hotel is good too for breakfast or a snack, enjoyed;5
"Nice Retro hotel however I seriously have issues being lied to about the beds.. they state it’s a QUEEN.. it’s somewhere around 55x74 because we measured it and that is the size of a double/full.  So if you want great reviews Wyndham don’t lie to people.  Our backs were killing us the entire stay and in the 3 nights I’m sure I slept less then 5 hours each night.    Now let’s talk bathrooms.. take note; if you plan a bathroom the size of one on a cruise ship at least be smart and turn the faucet to the side so you can wash your face wifhoyt hitting your hands on the middle I stalled faucet.  As for the sink itself, it’s less then 2 inches deep so the water absolutely flows over the sides no matter how low the flow.  Showers; the showers are built with a step in recessed base of";3
The hotel has good location. The stuff are very helpful. Room service is good . They clean it every day. However they provide coffee  machine only after a few requests. The room is very small. Old fashioned bath. They don’t serve breakfast. You  have to add extra money for the continental breakfast at the attached diner and to add extra money for every item.;3
Great view straight on to the Empire State Building as well as the Chrysler building, Madison square garden and downtown towards 1 World Trade and the Statue of Liberty. Balcony terrace was a bit neglected but the views were fabulous day or night even in the rain.  Wonderful art deco features throughout. 24 hour Tick Tock diner, Trattoria Restaurant and in the basement Butcher and Banker restaurant where you can dine in an old bank vault are all attached to the hotel.   My 1 criticism is the additional fees for phone, fitness centre, business centre and Wi-Fi which is compulsory. I didn't use any except the Wi-Fi which wasn't very responsive anyway so felt ripped off by this. If it's compulsory include it in the booking price. Even budget hotels in the UK provide free internet;4
We booked our trip and loved the location but overall stay wasn't great.   Hotel is old and dated but I'm ok with that. The problem is it's also dirty. Sheets, bed skirt, walls. Dirty  Front desk service was really great but the rest of the staff was pretty rude. We had to get a package and that was very difficult due to poor customer service.   Cliffs notes: hotel is in a great location but dirty.;2
Great location, value and staff! Staff have always gone out of their way to accommodate my needs, whether it's an early check in or a late check out. The attached restaurants are excellent if timing won't allow you to venture further.;5
This hotel is in a very central part of New York and very close to the subway.  It is not a new hotel but still lovely and the rooms can be small if you do not upgrade. Within walking distance to most main areas.  The diner downstairs is not that flash with a basic breakfast.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  The bar is very good.;4
We stayed for five nights, centrally placed, ten mins from Time Sq, 20 mins from Central Park. A block away from Empire State  Comfortable rooms, with good amenities, we had breakfast in Tick Tock one morning which was convenient and reasonably priced.  Staff are friendly and accommodating. I was given a bottle of bubbly for my birthday with was very kind of them.   We would definitely recommend staying at this hotel;4
We spent 11 days here in September and It was a nice stay.  Overall, the room was huge and more than enough for a family of five, but the rooms (and rest of the hotel for that matter) is tired and needs a massive renovation.  The staff seemed quite rude most of the time and only seemed interested in helping if you were going to tip them, plus I heard a lot of people complaining at the front desk.  The location is right in the middle of midtown and right next to Penn station so this saved a lot on taxis.;3
This is a great place to stay. It is convenient to subway stations, Time Square, Central Park and more. Two attached restaurants, ine is 24 hour diner, makes getting a bite very nice. I really liked security - you must show room key to get to elevators. Hotel is older, rooms are small but still in very good shape. I would stay there again.;5
Very disappointed. Paid $20(us) + resort fees per day for upgrade. Room had no coffee facilities, very dated room. Couldnt get TV working properly, had to get the TV replaced. Only good thing about this hotel is the location and the tick tock diner. Would never stay here again. As for the noise it was like the traffic was in our room. And we were on a higher floor.;1
Beautiful window view at intersection was lovely,  bathroom was welcoming and well laid out.  Comfortable sleeping accommodations.  Security guards were on their toes ensuring the safety of hotel guests at the lobby lounge area.  Although their approach was a bit rude,  I understood the intent.  Perhaps best they first announce they will be going around verifying those who are hotel guests and request others be prepared to exit.  As a guest, I felt very uncomfortable the manner I was approached by Security.;5
Great location for coming in from Penn Station. Friendly staff and easy check in and out. Room was very cold due to a/c not being able to regulate well. I would stay there again.   I walked to Times Square at night.  It was a lot of fun and an easy distance from the hotel.    The rooms were recently redone on my floor, so the bed and furnishings were nice and very comfortable. The bathroom and shower were updated too and worked very well.;4
Good hotel in a central position but definitely needs an upgrade !  We were moved 3 times for various reasons and the rooms were pretty much the same in decor and condition.   Staff were mostly helpful and friendly. Hardly a 4 star hotel but this is New York!;4
Small room, but that didn’t matter much to us since we spent most of our time out sightseeing. Wonderful location in Midtown, short walk to Times Square and the Empire State Building and right next to a subway station which made for easy travel. Pleasant staff.;4
Great Hotel with very nice facilities and amenities and staff in a wonderfully convenient Eighth Avenue and 34th Street location.  The very fast elevators are greatly appreciated and the atmosphere quiet and peaceful.;5
The last time we visited NYC, we stayed in New Jersey because of the hotel savings....there's no saving of either money nor TIME spent travelling back and forth to the big city! This time we chose The New Yorker and what a difference that made! It's within walking distance to both Penn Station, and the Port Authority if you want to take the subway or a bus anywhere. It's also walking distance to Times Square, Macy's and that whole shopping district. The Tick Tock Diner is attached to the hotel and I recommend it for breakfasts or that last snack of the evening...it was so convenient and the food is plentiful and tasty...best reuben sandwich I've ever had!  Felt very secure in the hotel itself, since everyone has to show their room card to the security guards before entereing the;5
The Location is very good, right next to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. The Rooms are small and outdated, but Hey Your in New York City that's the Norm. Staff was nice and helpful, especially Bell Boys, they really got a great system down.;4
Stunning hotel in the heart of the city! We stayed with our son for two nights and enjoyed it very much: The service was excellent and the familyroom organized by Mohammed because our room wasn‘t ready on time was outstanding! Will definitely recommend the hotel.;5
This hotel is right in the heart of things and considering the high prices of hotels in this area, the New Yorker is good value for money and we will stay here again on our next visit. Room was very clean, although the view wasn’t that good but it didn’t matter too much as we only slept there!;5
The receptionist at check in was incredibly rude, she wanted to swipe my credit card, but couldn’t explain properly why, so I’m still unsure why you’re holding around $200 on my credit card. The room and bed were incredibly small for two people and we’re small. The decor on 20th floor and in the room were tired, sound proofing was poor- the shower and alarm in the next room woke us up! Our room looked onto a derelict building. The door man arranged us a taxi to Newark. It was $90 and ten miles away!! Take the Air Train. Positives- Tick Tock diner and the Italian on ground floor we’re both good and not expensive. It’s one block from Macy’s.;2
Genuine hospitality. My brother was there last year and suggested me to stay at this particularly hotel because he was very satisfied. The food was great,service was excellent and room was top notch. Furthermore, it’s location it’s absolutely amazing and very convenient. Will definitely recommend this hotel.;5
My partner and I stayed here for three nights. The location is fantastic as the subway is right across the street and a short walk from Times Square. When we arrived we were quickly checked in. The room was really small and I think it would have been more suited to a single traveller. The bathroom needed a little upgrading, however, the room was always clean and tidy when we came back from being out all day. Hotel was quiet in the evenings. We always ate breakfast in the diner downstairs and we couldn’t fault it. It’s really handy that it’s open 24/7. Staff were all really helpful and friendly. Would stay here again.;4
Overall the hotel is in a good location, very central to everything.  Most of the rooms are small and outdated.  The check in experience was one of the worst I've ever experienced.  After at least a 30 minute line I asked to pay for a room upgrade and went upstairs to find one of the smallest rooms I'd ever seen.  We went back downstairs, waited again for approx. 20 minutes and were given another room.  In both cases the front desk clerks could not do anything without talking with a manager, a process where they disappeared for 10-15 minutes each time.  Upon checkout I was given a different room upgrade rate from what I was quoted and after waiting in line again...the lady at the front desk just stared at me like I was an idiot and it was my fault.  I travel 100+ days a year and;2
very well located in the hub of time square, very vibrant and busy hotel, free wifi and friendly staff, The breakfast is a bit expensive, but you will find many bakery and coffee shops near by. I stay at Wyndham hotel and recommended to many friends, up to now nobody complained , in fact all of them come back to thank me.;4
Great location for 24 hour  in NYC, walked to Time Square & Empire State  Building. We explored by foot until after 12am. The view of nigh lights from our room was beautiful. Hotel staff ++  The hotel held our luggage for the day, while we explored the city.;5
Front Desk Staff- Mohammed very accommodating & helpful.  After a long drive into the city it was great to see that he was able to assist me at check in. Definitely a good hotel that believes in customer service.;5
Spent a week in NYC and stayed at the New Yorker Hotel. Our view out of our window was the Empire State Building. Hotel building is beautiful - a block from Penn Station so very easy to get around. We took Amtrak from Virginia to NYC. We did a lot of walking. Hotel is 3 blocks from Macy's. .There are several coffee shops and places to eat within a block or two of hotel. We really enjoyed it and plan to go back;5
"I love New York City, I travel there about 5-6 times a year. I grabbed this deal off Hotwire. It it a beautiful old hotel, because it's so old an original I expected certain things like small bedrooms, small bathrooms, outdated styles. Though old is still appreciated by this young interior design intern. Not necessarily luxury, but gives you a true authentic New York experience. GREAT Location! Walking distance to Times Square.  Beds were extremely comfortable!!   The men who stand at the elevators give great service always talking to the guests as they pass. I do like that you have to show your pass key to get to the elevators, just a little safer.   Has the large red ""New Yorker"" sign been taken down? I didn't get to see it.   Nothing ""WOW'ed"" me but I did really enjoy my stay.";4
Stayed here for the 2nd time to celebrate our 17th wedding   anniversary. We asked for a high room with a view. This hotel not only gave us a high room, but we had a terrace on the 38th floor. Thank you for helping to make our celebration so special.  That is two visits, and two great experiences.  Recommended you visit this hotel.;5
I stayed 7 nights. On arrival wifi was down for almost all nigh, the second day my room was not serviced although there was not a NON Disturb sign out of the door, and finallly the worst of all as the hotel is making refurbishment in the restaurant on the entrance, there was no place to sit and work  or relax inside the hotel. The only option was sitting outside where there was no security from the hotel and of course homeless people from the street were coming and disturbing! Also from none of the reooms there is aEmpire state view as it shows on the interent!;2
Checked into the hotel yesterday. The staff were friendly and helpful. Really disappointed with the room. There is only one small window and because the carpet and furniture is dark the whole room looks dark and dingy. Room and double bed is very small. Furniture is very dated. Bathroom, although clean is very cramped. So although it’s in a good location I would not stay at this hotel again;2
Handy to walk from Penn Station. Great view of the Empire State Building. Comfortable beds. Very helpful staff- Mohammad made our check in very smooth. 15 Minute walk to Times Square. The staff were very helpful, and we were able to store our suitcases on checkout day so we could continue to tour around NYC.;5
Very special place in the middle of Manhattan. Great location, walking distance to all Midtown attractions. Fantastic design, NY classic. Super friendly staff, received great front desk welcome from Mr. Mohammed, including excellent room recommendation.;4
Our stay at the New Yorker was fabulous. I was emailed prior to my stay with offers and an opportunity for personal requests. They were able to put us in a room with a spectacular view of the Empire State Building. I was impressed with their personal attention—especially from a hotel with so many rooms. We’d loved learning about the history of the hotel too—there’s a historical display downstairs.;5
hi just wanna give a shout out to two great employees at this hotel. Rachel & Mohammad . we came in on the red eye  from the west coast Rachel noticed from my i.d it was my birthday and helped us get in off the street early from over night travel . they upgrades our room and gave me a bottle of bubbly for my bday. they were polite and courteous  in a town thats not known for this . kudos and thanks  we had a great time here;5
Treated to a short break in NY by my son. We shared a room on the 32nd floor with amazing views. Made very welcome at check in. The room was very clean- being British would have liked a kettle. The bathroom was clean and the shower great. No complaints at all - perfect location toget about. If I am lucky enough to ever c9me again - this is where 8 would like to stay.;5
Arrived at this hotel around 15.30 Friday afternoon. 1st impressions was chaos has so many people around but soon has they saw us made a beeline for us by Chris. Wife is a wheelchair user and he made a fuss. Our room was not ready so had a drinks voucher until room was ready. Chriss upgraded the room has accessible room was small with a tub. We needed roll in shower. Chris came and got us when room was ready. Accessible room 2121 very roomy. Only drawback grab rail by side of toilet to high. Staff could do no more for us especially concierge who really looked after us. Had a breakfast voucher but very limited what you could have for breakfast. only a little niggle air conditioning in lobby so cold.  Tic toc restaurant was fab but you had to eat food fast and drink rapidly has;4
Arrived on a friday evening before labour day weekend with my 19 year old son. very busy reception and we ended up in the smallest room ever (2119) in a double bed. we somehow got a fold away bed in the room and told the concierge. she informed us to come back in the morning and request the duty manager. i did and he was very helpful. we went out for the day and they did a 'hot move' of all our luggage to a great room (3232). a great recovery and the service you dont get every day. Thank you. Any issues ask for the duty manager first thing in the morning. Great location and good service.;4
Terrible services!!! Terrible concierge!!! Dated room!! The fourth floor to the eighteenth floor are dorms and small schools, not a hotel! And we were put on the 19th floor! We reserved the room with king size bed but was given the twins instead without any explanation. The receptionist just said it would be more comfortable for you two. But I wanted one King size bed and she could not make the decision for me!! The concierge's manner was really bad. When we asked for the cheapest way to get to the airport, he offered the most expensive choice first, which is  to get there by taxi! We had to find the information on our own until we got to know that there s a shuttle to the airport. We bought the ticket from the concierge, who was not really pleased with our choice. Our flight;1
Had a city view room on 29th floor - beds were comfortable and room well equipped. Bathroom/shower needs updating. Staff friendly, food options around the area good (Tick Tock Diner) and of course the location is perfect for the Metro;4
A very pleasant hotel, superb location. Penn Station is right around the corner. Book room 3714 on the 37th floor. Stunning view! No breakfast included but there is everything you need around - pharmacy, supermarkets, good take away food corners.  Will choose The New Yorker hotel again if I come to NYC.;5
If you want to visit New York City, I strongly recommend to stay at The New Yorker Hotel! It’s THE best and authentic place to stay, with gym, business center, fast WiFi, and really wonderful rooms. It is my third stay here, and every time it was just perfect. AND: It has not only one of the greatest lobbies, but also one of the best receptionists in town: Mohammed! So friendly, so helpfully, I was really well received - he made my day! Mohammed is in a class of his own!;5
Top location, nice staff, excellent view. You have a lot of Diner, coffee shops and other shops around the hotel. Subway and Penn Station just around the corner, also Empire State Building, Macys and 42th Street not far away. Rooms are very clean and cosy.;4
I was very lucky to have been given a room with dual aspect. From my front window  I had The Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building, and from my other window  I had the One World Trade Centre.  The staff were excellent, friendly and accommodating. My room was extremely clean.  Location very central. My first choice of hotel every year when I visit New York.  Great hotel.;5
While checking into the hotel in the late evening with my three young and precocious children, I became aware that I had booked the wrong dates. After traveling half the day in a car, my children were bouncing off the walls and creating a disturbance which raised my blood pressure. Mohammed to the rescue! With a reassuring smile he told me not to worry and reminded me that these moments were to be cherished. Mohammed then went to work and guided me on the best path towards adjusting my booking so that I would be able to stay at this historic hotel that evening. I truly appreciated his demeanor and professionalism. He even followed up the following day to make sure our needs were being met. This gentlemen is indicative of the hospitality and beauty of this hotel. This hotel is;5
Our 1st trip to NY and it was during NYFW! We stayed at the New Yorker and it was fabulous. Everyone was very helpful and nice. It is a beautiful place to stay and in a great location. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that will be traveling to NY.;5
Booked a Queen room with a view of The Empire State Building, View was great but disappointed with room. Found the room small but at least comfortable, tick tock diner was easy for breakfast before touring and hotel position great to get around New York.;3
Rooms are a little small and bathroom tiny but it's expected in New York! Fast and friendly check in. Tick Tock diner great for breakfast and cake. Brilliant location beside Madison Square Gardens and a few minutes walk from Macy's. We had a view of the Empire State Building from our room. Planning to revisit soon!;4
If you like old world elegance and charm then this is your hotel.  I call it a favorite when I stay in New York city.  Location is incredible and the workability factor is great.  Note of caution if you do not like older charming hotels, then you might rethink your plans.  Along with charm comes smaller rooms and also the building shows it self as being older.  Service and atmosphere always outweigh these factors for my stays.  Great place to stay for Broadway plays.;4
We arrived at the New Yorker exhausted from traveling and Mohamed greeted us with a warm smile and fast service. He even offered to upgrade our room so we could have a better view of the city. I definitely recommend this hotel not just based on location but how the staff is so invested in your experience.;5
The lobby has been restored to its 1920s grandeur. It is beautiful! The service is quite good. I had a smelly room upon checking in and they moved me immediately.   This is an old building, so the infrastructure reflects that. However, there is a certain charm, and if you get a quiet room (Hotel is at the corner of 8th ave and 34th street = pretty busy, and noisy), you will be just fine. Rooms are small. Bed is comfy.   The great thing is that this hotel is central. You can walk to almost anywhere in the city from here!;4
Planned a overnight get a way trip into NYC to see a couple of Broadway plays - we got to the  New Yorker no reservations on file. I had my confirmation having gone through TripAdvisor to book my room, and to my regret prepaid for my room thinking I was safe with the TripAdvisor affiliation. TripAdvisor takes no accountability in problem resolution for companies they partner with, so  I called Cancelon customer service was told they were working on it and would get back to me shortly. Well 2 1/2 hours later no response, called again and told it would be resolved in 15-20 minutes. Well 2 1/2 hours later (yes now over 5 hours) no response,  it rained all day, we had no hotel to change for the evening and we had a prepaid hotel room that did not exist.   Finally sometime around;1
Visited NY and stayed in the New Yorker. Great location and in walking distance for lots of the attractions. Rooms slightly small but when you consider when the place was built it’s fine, and there’s so much to do that we weren’t in the hotel that much.  MSG, Empire State, Central Park, Macy’s, Times Square and others all near to the hotel. Bus stop for Big Bus Tours nearby which is a great way to see more, from a different perspective, and with a quality audio commentary, would definitely recommend this.;4
The room although small was sufficient, clean, comfy bed and pillows.  Staff is very helpful and friendly.  We only stayed one night, queen bed, hotel was quiet.  Located close to Broadway for shows and great restaurants.;5
Had another fantastic stay at the New Yorker. Arrived on 2nd Sept for 6 nights and were given a lovely upgrade room. Although the room was quite small it was totally modernised with a walk in shower. All the staff we spoke to at the hotel were very friendly and helpful.   The hotel is ideally located to get around the whole of Manhatten.  Already booked to come back next year though we are coming at the end of June for 1 week for Independence Day.;5
Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in April, I had booked a room with 2 twin beds but when I checked in I was given 1 double bed. The hotel was fully booked so they couldn’t give me alternative room so gave a fold out bed to compensate. The room was rather small and a bit dated but served its purpose. On the plus side it’s a great central location which is worth the booking.;3
My stay was great i hate there was no swimming pool. I love to just get in the water. I come to shop and see am i missing. I would only visit i would never live here. To many people and bad parking. You do not need a car to live in New York.;4
We spent 4 nights as we arrived to the big apple.  The checking in was very fast . We arrived to a quiet small double bed room which the beds where very comfortable how ever the was badly furnished and the maitanence wasn’t good.  It’s a good thing we only had to sleep in the room and not stay in it more than we should.  All And all great location 8av /34 th street but a very average hotel !;3
We loved the location it was just a few blocks from everywhere we wanted to be.  Room was small but lovely. Clean & compact. We were room only so didn’t eat here. I found the business room downstairs a great idea free of charge for printing flight documents etc & also we could make free calls. Would definitely return.;5
We have stayed in New Yorker hotel when we have visited New York. Nikola Tesla’s room was still there. The hotel is pretty central to everything. Empire state building, 5th Avenue and time square are within walking distance! Will definitely go back.;4
The New Yorker has an interesting history with many celebrities lives intertwined. Roaming around certain areas provides visual cues about a fascinating background. The Art Deco features are also very attractive.  It is an older building and those are challenging to maintain.  While we had issues with bedbugs, we did get moved to better accommodations and the last one did not have bed bugs but bed bugs are a new challenge in warmer climates. The specialists did not find evidence in the first room but my husbands reactions on his arm from the first bedroom and mine from the first and second led to a horrible experience. The last suite on the 38th floor (there are 40 floors) provided a breathtaking view of New Yorker. The managers tried to provide better alternatives and the suite;3
From beginning till the end, just simply amazing. Top notch right i  the heart of the city. Doesn't get any better then this. Will definitely be back. Till next time Ask for Randy at the Front desk. He's a cutie;5
The Wyndham New Yorker was a great hotel to stay in while we were visiting NYC.  I booked it originally because it was close to Penn Station and the rates were acceptable.  I would definitely choose this hotel again, because of the location, cleanliness and price, but mostly because the Front Desk staff went above and beyond to accommodate our needs.  Who says New Yorkers are not friendly!!  They were great!;5
When we requested separate sleeping accommodations - there was not a room to meet our needs available. However Mohammed worked with us to gain access to a room with added space so a daybed could be set up - and provided complimentary drinks for us while we waited for the room to be cleared after a late departure.   Working with clients in this way takes a little extra time - and really does leave a positive lasting impression.;5
My wife, brother in-law and I visited the Wyndham Hotel the first week in September 2018. We found the rooms dated but adequate.   On arrival, we queued at reception to book into our rooms. We had been travelling from the UK for over 8 hours and were quite tired. I noticed the queue moved very slowly and it seemed to take ages to get to the desk.  I noticed there were 2 receptionists at the desk checking guests in. What was very annoying was 1 of the receptionists was chatting to the other and not taking care of the guests standing in front of her. She even said to me, when I reached the desk that she can't help interfering with what her colleague was doing. It was very tiring watching her talking to her colleague whilst other guests stood waiting to be checked in but being;3
I had the best NYC stay at the New Yorker ! Historical building has some very cool architecture—- Really a great room - plenty of space for me and my three kids. We really liked the location - minutes to Times Square and we even walked down to Chelsea market and a nearby park to run off some steam on a nice day !  I can also say that the front desk, the bell staff, the hotel lobby attendants were all very attentive and friendly. The breakfast diner was perfect for a pancake breakfast.  The housekeeping staff was also wonderful. I really can’t say enough good things .  I have stayed now at almost all the big chains and a few small ones and this one was the best for me and my children .  Thanks !;5
New Yorker is perfectly placed for visit to NY! We picked it as it is right across from penn station which we used to travel for Newark and onward to Washington ! Don’t expect anything fancy, rooms are small but clean, no extras like water, tea coffee etc in rooms. Good choice when you are not going to spend anytime in room apart from sleeping!;4
Yes the rooms are not necessarily the best not helped by the tired carpets when you walk out of the elevator but the New Yorker remains a great location being so close to Penn Station and a hotel with great tradition.  Staff are alway most helpful and accommodating, I love finding another nugget of memorabilia from times past and it simply works when I visit as it has such easy access to both metro and Long Island Rail Road.;4
We want to complement the concierge staff of the hotel. They were helpful, thorough, courteous and clear. Their information greatly enhanced our experience of New York outside the time share presentation. Thanks;5
Had a fantastic few days in this Hotel, very clean room, very comfortable bed and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The Hotel is located perfectly with the Maddison Square Garden, Empire State Building, Broadway and Time Square all within walking distance. Great security;5
I haven’t stayed in many hotels in New York so I don’t have much to compare this one to, so this review is completely objective.  The location is amazing, right in the middle of so many things and walking distance to many more.  The lobby is beautiful and is a very impressive welcome to the hotel.   The rooms, however are downright appalling. Cleanliness is not an issue, everything is spotlessly clean. Even the tiny size of the rooms is not a real issue. Although annoying that in some rooms you can only just about walk around the bed you can accept it because the hotel has such a great location.  The lack of amenities is very disappointing, no coffee machine although I hear they will provide one upon request?? No fridge. The toiletries provided are of shocking quality, I don’t;2
"We extended our stay at the New Yorker, which was booked for a 6-day guided NYC tour. We were able to see all the highlights on our bucket list using public transportation and walking. We tried 2 of the 3 hotel's restaurants. Italian very good, and diner pretty good. Some rooms apparently have not been renovated; ours was, and it was attractive and very clean. The first room we saw was tiny, but we were able to stay in a slightly larger one. Penn Station, Macy's, Empire State Bldg., pubs, and a drugstore close by.";5
I originally took my husband (then boyfriend) here for his 30th back in 2002 and had an amazing time. Although we have returned to New York since, it has been for work/to see family so we have not had to choose where to stay again until this year. For his wedding present, I surprised my husband with a skiing trip to Canada and then a weekend in NYC for St Patricks day. For nostalgic reasons and based on our trip years ago (see the 5* review I gave), I choose the New Yorker.  We arrived after a long connecting flight from Vancouver and were checked in fairly efficiently. We had hoped to upgrade on arrival as I remembered last time, it was easier (and cheaper!) at the hotel but thought we would check the room first. The room was tiny. Even by NYC standards. To this day, I suspect;2
The best hotel in New York. Central location close to all attractions transport and restaurants. Had a suite this time it was amazing. No beverage facilities in the room which would be appreciated especially in the mornings and on arrival after international flights. That said no problem using a travel kettle. Coffee shop straight facing hotel.   Love everything about this hotel.;5
Loved the location of the hotel and staff were great. Dined at Tick Tock a few times and food / drink were good quality, well priced and generously portioned. Did have a lengthy wait one night but overall very pleased with Tick Tock experience. Guest room and room corridors were clean but somewhat tired - our double room was small, dim and seemed dated (especially bathroom)  with slight odour of tobacco smoke. Everything was clean, well serviced and fully operational, though hot water did take some minutes to appear for shower / washing.;4
No having stayed any where else in midtown Manhattan, I found the room small and in need of update.  Everything was clean but the grout around the tub was in dire need of replacement, very mildewed. For over 250$US per night, I expected more. The location was excellent for access to the subway system and for walking everywhere though so I guess that is what you pay for. The next time I go to New York, I would stay outside of Manhattan and just utilize transit to get in and out of town as it's super easy to use, fast and efficient. Well worth the unlimited use Metro card price.;3
Our family stayed here in August ‘18 We had a very pleasant stay. Arrived in the night, smooth friendly check in.  We booked a standard bedroom with two beds.  Being first time in NYC, looked out from the window and the view was just overwhelming.  So majestic, only NYC can be.  I could not asked to be in a more central position as we were. Empire State Building, Crysler and Time Square just in a reach.  We use Tic Toc restaurant few times and always complemented their meals.  Being with our son, and the Restaurant being open 24/7 was very handy for us.  We were always treated with a great customer care.  I love the fact, the hotel has it's own car, we had used to get to the Heli Flights and to JFK.  We felt the hotel offered comfortable and safe place to stay.  I would happily;5
Terrible experience at this hotel. Everything is outdated here. The rooms are small, the customer service is terrible, was charged for a movie we did not watch, and they do not have enough carts to load your own luggage. Take your business elsewhere. You're better off at a Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton, etc.;1
I had already booked and paid online so check in was quick with minimal wait. I had booked 3 rooms but unfortunately one wasn’t ready and we had to wait until 5.30pm for the key.All rooms had a view,floors 21 and 22. Two viewed the river and one the Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens. We found the hotel to be quiet at night and the beds were the most comfortable I have ever found in a hotel. We requested coffee machines in two rooms and it wasn’t a problem to get extra supplies. Six lifts served floors 20 upwards and there was never a wait.We dined in Tick Tock four times, two breakfasts and two evenings, the food and service was great.The staff we encountered were friendly and helpful and we had a great stay.I would recommend The New Yorker to anyone.;4
Had two rooms at The New Yorker for a 3 night stay in August. The hotel was perfectly situated for seeing as much of the city in such a short stay as possible.  The rooms were excellent and immaculate and all the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Loved the Art Deco styling and the hotel history display in the basement was interesting.  We used the Airtrain and LIRR/subway for our journeys to and from the airport which were easy, convenient and faster than a taxi. Penn Station is just a very short walk from the hotel which was an added benefit with 5 cases!;5
We found the Hotel was great, situated opposite Madison square garden, a short walk to Macy's and the Empire State Building. The Marble entrance and and chandelier makes an impressive welcome. The staff were very friendly and couldn't of been more helpful.;5
The hotel is very clean, professional in a great area. The cost was surprisingly good for the location. Walking distance to the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Times Square. The room wasn't large but I was just there to sleep so not an issue. There is no pool. There is a lot of history to this hotel, so go downstairs and check it out. There is a restaurant and bar so you can always eat right there if needed. I recommend it if you don't care about all the extras you typically don't take advantage of anyway (besides a pool haha).;4
Stayed for 5 nights 23rd-28th Aug. Hotel staff very friendly & helpful. Great location for seeing the main sights/attractions. Tick Tock restaurant good value and staff very helpful and friendly. Would definetly stay again!;4
This would be like a time-travel to the past with its old, classic and vintage architecture, great location in the middle of the City, walking distance to Madison Square Garden, simply a great stay and affordable as a bonus. I would recommend it with only compliments.;5
Stay was fine, the room was good. One of the concierges was very rude and unhelpful when asked a simple question. Overall pleasant stay but Ive had better stays at the Roosevelt and I liked the locale better.;3
My room was disgusting -- filthy headboard, rusted towel racks in the bathroom, grime in the shower, and old/musty smell. I was really disappointed because the building is my style (art deco and vintage) and I do love the vintage fixtures, however my room was just so gross. The room had no amenities --  no fridge, no microwave, no coffee machine. The cups in the room are plastic. I felt like I was at a roadside motel in 1980.;1
"The staff at this hotel is insanely rude. We had a couple of questions and issues and everyone answered with an ""I dont know its NYC do it yourself"" attitude. If you are expecting customer service, do not stay here. Also, this hotel does not have reliable room service so get ready to venture out if youre hungry. AWFUL experience. Would not recommend to anyone.";1
Had a three night stay with family and was really impressed with the location of the hotel, right by Macy’s and a short walk to Empire State Building and Madison Square Gsrden. Also close to Penn station and subway so easy to get around.   The room was compact but was fine for us. It had everything we needed.  The hotel is in a noisy area, but it is New York and visitors shouldn’t expect anything different.  The staff were very helpful and knowledgeable.;4
A historic hotel with a proud history. Today, hotel-wise, I consider it average. On the plus side, it is in a very good location in midtown Manhatten, opposite Madison Square Garden and next to Penn Station. It is a decent place, good for a quick stay or for a business trip, just don't expect anything fancy. Some of the floors are rented out as student accommodation so you will see a lot of students there. The 24-hour diner is very handy if you need to eat or drink at odd hours. You can visit an exhibition about the history of the hotel in the basement for free.;3
Stayed for 4 nights at the hotel, great location, right across the street from 34th Street and Penn station, so ideal to travel around, plus in walking distance to a lot of attractions, such as The Empire State Building and Times Square.  The lobby is wonderful, this is an Art Deco hotel and the lobby is of a high standard, shame we couldn't say the same for our room, which was 'tired' and in need of refurbishment, having said that the bed was very comfy and the maid service very good.  Some people have said they only check if you have a hotel card dependent on the colour of your skin, this was not true, they check everybodies, and do so in a casual friendly manner.  All in all a good hotel, that is just in need of some TLC in some rooms.;3
Was pleasantly surprised with this Hotel. Check in was a great experience, fast and made us feel very welcome. Good location near Penn Station and many NYC Trains. Madison Square Garden close by. Many restaurants and bars near by. I would stay here again. The only complaint is they are following the Time Square Hotels by charging a so called BS Resort Fee. It is far from a resort.;4
Excellent, clean hotel with a lovely room with a fantastic view of the city. Ideal location for getting around the City of Manhattan. Excellent customer service from all the staff. Great price.....and I would most defiantly recommend this hotel to friends and family;5
Review WYNDHAM NEW YORKER- STAYED AUGUST 29,2018  Great hotel for the money. I have stayed at the New Yorker before and was not disappointed this time either. I am 83 years old and traveling alone. Prior to my stay, I called and asked for early entry so that I could take a nap prior to attending the show, Pretty Woman. I was told that it could not be promised but that they would do what they could to accommodate me. When I arrived at the hotel there was no one at the Rewards Desk. There were about thirty people in line for registration. I could not stand in that line and could not get anyone to help me. I noticed, Crystal standing behind the Wyndham Vacations Desk which had nothing to do with registration. I said to her, “Would you please help me? I am 83 years old and too weak;5
I haven't been to NY for many years. I was so very impressed by all of the staff. Everyone was so pleasant and polite, nothing was too much trouble. The housekeeping staff were just delightful. Now If you are looking for modern and fancy, you might be a bit disappointed. We just needed a place to sleep and bathe. The rooms are very retro, but clean and functional, exactly what I need in a room (its not like I'm moving in or anything!!). All in all, a great trip!;5
I would recommend staying at the New Yorker.  It is very clean and centrally located although the rooms are not spacious or fancy.  You do need to ask for such things as coffee maker and fridge for your room.;4
We had a great five nights stay, with an amazing view of the Empire State Building. We were celebrating my partners 30th and we received an upgrade and a bottle of champagne. The lady who checked us in was so friendly and couldn’t help us enough. Great location and the most comfy beds! Highly recommend!;5
Shopping for 3 nights in The New yorker a wyndham hotel in NY and the advertised price is imposible to found in the whole year, groupon advertised a price for this hotel that do not exist or is only available 2 or 3 days of the whole year. just for this we are booking in another hotel. beware offers form hotels in general from groupon.;1
We arrived at Newark and were taken to the hotel by shuttle bus – at about 4pm – the journey took over an hour ( god knows what a cab would’ve charged) The hotel is easily located in Midtown 34th and 8th . Less than 5 mins walk from Madison Square Garden Less than 5 mins walk from Penn station Approx 10-15 min walk to 42nd st and broadway Approx 15 mins from Times Square Therefore with rail links it is ideally located. The lobby is very grand and it felt great walking through the revolving doors into the air conditioned lobby from the heat and noise outside. Staff at reception and the concierge desk were very friendly and helpful. Security was good too, nobody has access to the lift area and floors above without presenting a key to a security guard. There are plenty of lifts;4
I had a corner suite, it was a spectacular view of the city and I had two rooms, one sofa bed and one queen bed and or three people t was a great price. Bedding and rooms were very clean, there is very good breakfast in the the restaurent and best bagels in five minutes walk on 35th street.;5
I was at The New Yorker recently for a weekend break, the hotel is located very close to Penn station and within walking distance to all tourist attractions. I had a lovely room at the front of the hotel with beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline. The product is slightly monochrome to my taste and little dated but it’s well maintained. The team were very welcoming and friendly, provided exquisite service specially from Miguel and Jolson at reception.;5
Love this hotel every time I go to New York this is where I stay, close to Times Sq, MSG just over the road the staff are really friendly and very helpful. There is a restaurant and Tick Tock diner open 24hrs,this hotel is ideal and also getting a refurbishment.;4
The New Yorker is now my 'hotel of choice' when I visit NYC.  The handicapped room was fantastic, service was excellent and the location was the best when using Amtrak.  The breakfast was delicious.  It was fun being in a hotel with so many historic features!  Read about the history of the hotel on their website before going! Very interesting!;5
this was our first visit to NYC and this hotel was perfectly positioned for our needs. It is only 2 minutes from Madison Square Gardens, Train and Subway Stations and 10 minutes walk from Times Square, we were on the 18th floor with a view to the rear which was fine and we could just see the Hudson River. The room had two beds which was a little tight for 3 people, we were there for 6 nights and the storage space for clothes was very limited. The lobby is very impressive, the Tic Toc dinner that is connected to the Lobby was very good and cleanliness of the hotel was excellent.;5
This is the most fantastic place to stay while in NY. The building is incredible, centrally located for access to all tourist hot spots, and it oozes Art Deco design and charm from its every pore. The standard rooms are clean, basic and a little on the small side but what do you expect for a mid town hotel? Enough room for 2. The staff are incrediblyfriendky and helpful especially the wonderful Samira on the front desk,who assisted in sorting out a booking error made by my travel company when they had left me stranded - this woman was an angel and is a true asset to the hotel staff, turning a disaster into a great stay. This was my second stay at The Wyndham New Yorker and I hope it won’t be my last. Why would anyone stay anywhere else?;5
We stayed on the 29th floor, the room was quite and comfortable. The hotel staff were friendly and were helpful with any problems or enquiries. They have a lovely  tick tock diner attached to the hotel as well.;4
I booked this hotel through an outside agent (flyporter escapes from Toronto Canada) and the requests I had for a room with a cot were met with confirmation through them and you.  Closer to the date, I did go online and even called the hotel to make sure my reservation was confirmed and realized I had two different confirmation numbers listed.  One from Porter Escapes and one from your Hotel.  Immediately I inquired with Porter Escapes to explain this discrepancy in which they would contact the hotel to clear anything up.  With an hour, my issue was resolved and explained to me both from your end and from my booking agent.  The attention to my concern was certainly addressed in a timely matter and the booking department was absolutely on the ball with making sure my one little;5
The location and hotel was perfect. However, the suite was small. The restroom was right next to the pull out sofa in tight quarters. The restroom is very small. The hotel is older but well maintained. I would stay here again but in a different room.;4
Brilliant hotel, very central too pretty much everything, obviously walking is involved in New York.  Penn station is pretty much next-door which is a good thing if you don’t mind the tube from the airport.   Staff were all friendly and helpful and I’d defo stay again, also the restaurant attached to the hotel is great for pancakes in the morning.;5
I wish I had pictures of this place.  Not sure why I forgot to take a picture??   This hotel is very centrally located.  It is very busy!!  My room was nice and big but I seen and heard of others that are tiny.  It has nice architecture though and the staff were lovely!  My room was clean and well stocked.  My friends room had a kitchenette that was also very nice.  It is very old, but I think that gives it character!  It is also very close to the subway.  All in all it was a great stay!;4
A nice hotel in a good location. Very cramped for a family of four in one room and a tiny bathroom. A smell of damp throughout the 29th floor where we were staying.  Hotel staff were friendly and helpful.;4
The biggest asset of this hotel it is the great location, in the middle of Manhattan, close to many central touristic spots like Broadway, the Times Square etc’. It is also surrounded by many shops, restaurants and a few subway stations. Besides that, everything else was just ok. The room was small but clean. It had thin walls so every noise was noticeable. The bathroom wasn’t comfortable, mainly because there was almost no space to keep all the toiletries. The service was just fine, quite polite but not really friendly. The lobby was always overcrowded and it looked like a busy train station. Also, they charge you to keep your luggage and in addition, tried to charge (30 dollars per day!!!) for something strange such as hotel services (wi fi, gym etc). After arguing with the;3
Stayed for three nights. Room was very small and not very well insulated from outside noise. The bathroom was really grotty featuring mould on the grouting of the wall tiles in the bathroom.  Great location though - very central.;2
Incredible welcome on checking in. Hotel is in a fantastic location close to main subway station, Macy’s etc. Found the team who sold tours etc a little brusque and impatient which is completely at odds from the rest of the staff we encountered. Do think the bathrooms could be updated, without losing their original charm. But all in all a great experience and we would happily return !;4
We were a party of three adults. We stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker for six nights. It is so so central to everything a stroll to times square Penn Station or Maceys. The room was small but excellent. It is New York so you can expect smallish rooms. Air conditioning good. Shower and bathroom excellent. Security checks everyone before they reach the elevator so we felt very safe. We ate breakfast three mornings in the tick tock diner which we found great. We ate the other three mornings from the coffee shop in the lobby- coffee and danish as we were on the go we also found this excellent. Great hotel all round- my tip is to ask for room with view of Empire state Building on check in. We did and it was great to view it especially at night. We will definitely stay here the next;5
Check in staff was great - long line moved quickly. Verified our stay, directed us to bell services to store our bags as we checked in early. Room was beautiful - 40th floor, view of the river. A/C working great - much appreciated as it was a hot, muggy weekend. Comfortable queen size bed, nice bathroom with tub/shower. Room had a fridge & a Keurig with a nice supply of coffee/tea products. Bag storage after check-out is available - $4./bag. Very convenient to Penn Station - barely a block walk. Security staff was very efficient & guest services was most helpful.;5
We reached late night, after a long journey.  09th 08 2018  Room was small. Didn't look very inviting. As we were really tired traveling, just crashed out for the night. Next morning we had the impression the breakfast was on the house, - so it was on booking. But were not served. Otherwise an average stay.;3
Location is super, close to everything.  Room are also super clean, the front desk is always  courteous and sees to your needs.  I stay at this hotel at least 5 - 10 times every year.  The restaurants are great, really good food, restaurant staff also kind and courteous to myself and my family.  I highly recommend this hotel to everyone!;5
Visited with a friend for my birthday. They upgraded our room and we had the most amazing view. Fresh bedding and towels daily. The room was spotless. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were to die for, could not fault it. The only downside was we weren't told there was a daily fee until we checked out and when I asked what this was for they said use of Wi-Fi and telephone calls. So don't fall for the free WiFi because it's obviously not free. We had to pay nearly $100 this was extortionate as we were only in out room to sleep. Didn't get a chance to use the so called free WiFi!!! If we had been told when we  checked in we would have been prepared. Lesson learnt!!!;4
"First the pros; the hotel has a lot of historical charm, and nice art deco style.  Our room, while small, had only one queen bed, so it still seemed plenty large.  We had a view of the Hudson from our 29th floor room.  The bed was comfortable, with crisp, cool sheets.  The lobby was nice and it was handy to have three restaurants right on site.  We had a 5 hour delay on our flight, so it was great to have the Tick Tock Diner right there, open 24/7, so we could still get something to eat at 10:30 p.m.  Staff was pleasant. Even though the street outside was busy, we had little to no noise to disturb our sleep.  The con; really, only one--the bathroom is a typical footprint for what would have been standard in 1929, in that it was SMALL.  No room to put your toiletries, and one of";4
Checked for seven nights. Beautiful helpful people. Can’t do enough for you. 34 dining, room clean bright with air con. Centrally location for all your shopping and attachion needs. Food at the diner is you typical fare. Only downside in room is no facilities to make a drink however with the diner downstairs it’s not so bad;5
We had to book a last minute reservation with the Wyndham New Yorker, and thus ran into obstacles that might typically accompany booking a room in New York City at the last minute. Linda at the front desk, however, was AMAZING, and she helped us successfully navigate those obstacles, making our experience there one we won't soon forget. Thanks for all your help Linda!;5
We stayed here for 5 nights in July and found the hotel to be fantastic for our needs. The location was great, we received an early check in, a bottle of bubbly on arrival and a big congratulations as it was the start of our honeymoon. Yes the hotel is older in style but we thought that it added to it’s charm. The diner and bar attached were really handy for early morning/late night snacks & drinks and the staff in both and the hotel were friendly & helpful throughout. The only small negative was very poor water pressure in the shower - to be fair we didn’t raise this as an issue with the hotel, wasn’t really a deal breaker for us for the short duration of the trip but could be improved. We stayed on 21st floor and our room was really quiet & peaceful - would certainly recommend;4
This hotel has old units that they give to people that use 3rd parties to pay . It's like they purposely save the outdated , smaller rooms for  customers they feel shouldn't get a good deal on their rooms. The Tv's are even smaller. And when I asked to be in an updated room they said they did t have any available. However, my sister. Hdckrx I. After me and she was given an updated room, probably  because she agreed to take a timeshare tour. They begin harassing  you as soon as you enter into the lobby of the hotel.  And everytime you go anywhere near the front desk. I wouldn't stay hear again. The Wyndham 345 is much better.;2
Stayed in the New Yorker as part of my wife’s 40th birthday celebrations in May half term. Firstly flew Bristol to Dublin and on to JFK, would recommend as no hassle with immigration at JFK as all sorted in Dublin so walked straight out of JFK. We caught the monorail to Jamaica Station and the LIRR into Penn station. From JFK to the hotel lobby in 40 mins, so easy and safe and cheap, would 100% recommend.  Hotel staff were very friendly, we explained it was my wife’s 40th and first time away from the kids and we were upgraded to a suite high up and with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building and a complementary bottle of Fizz and some breakfast tokens for the attached TicTock Diner, this was an amazing gesture. The room was spot on and the location is great and central;5
This is a great vacation snooze joint for those traveling on a tight budget. I was in room 3621 and I couldn’t have asked for a better room. Mine had one of the most beautiful views of the city. The housekeeping team is incredible. They are doing the most.  Tip: ask for corner rooms with a view of the Rockefeller Center and Empire State Building. NB: I thought it could use mini bars in the rooms though;4
I know The New Yorker is an old hotel, so I was prepared for it to perhaps be a little dated. And it was. I had hoped it’d be charming. But unfortunately I was not charmed.   Cons: Cleaning: Sub-par to say the least. Long dark hairs on the towels, grimy looking tile, mold in the bathtub, a strange wet spot on the carpet inside the door.   Past it’s prime: Decor and carpeting in the hallways was old, dingy, and smelled stale. Felt a little creepy in a strange way.   Bathroom: Very compact (ie. tiny!) No storage space for your toiletries- just a very narrow glass shelf above the sink - with barely enough room for one person’s things. Also, extremely  high hooks to hang your towels or whatever. As a short person that was very annoying.   Bedding: No blanket or cover on the bed or;3
Booked this hotel for 1 night in July. The room was clean, well appointed but probably one of the smallest I have ever stayed in. The bathroom looked dated but was also period which I think made it more charming. There was a diner downstairs (Tick-Tock) which was modern retro, 60's style. We only had drinks but enjoyed sitting at the bar watching people walk by outside.  I would stay here again if I could get for the same low price.;4
I was here for a funeral, so I didn’t have time to address the issue with the early checking schedule. I was disappointed that the desk clerk didn’t follow through and notify me that the room was ready, especially since I let her know that I was there for a funeral.;4
I would recommend this gorgeous hotel in the middle of everything in New York CityAll the employees are very  kund and the room and bathroom are clean and comfortableI had a great time during my vacatio there;5
Very good location and the staff are pleasant and friendly. The rooms are small, basic and a bit tired and our corridor was a little noisy as was unfortunately put in a room across from the ice dispenser machine. The tick tock diner downstairs was great for breakfast. WiFi was also very good. All in all, good stay but have stayed in better city break hotels in New York.;3
The New Yorker is a grand dame of a hotel - fantastic lobby with detail to satisfy the most ardent Art Deco lover. The hotel has some sort of museum downstairs to commemorate Tesla, who lived in the hotel for a period of 10 years.  The rooms are typical New York: old, smallish (compared to South African hotels) and with older bathrooms. Brown horrible carpets seem to be the norm in NYC and the New Yorker does not disappoint.  Great hotel though.Great location, with loads of shopping nearby. There was a ComicCon event around the corner so long lines snaked around the hotel, creating a fantastic sight.;4
Came down for a show at MSG from Boston.  Service staff were awesome, walked across the blockto get to show, maybe 120 yards- fabulous. Walked up 34th st, great sites, haven't been there for almost 40 years.  Gotta love Manhattan. Best people watching area in the world!!!Don't eat at the tick tock, service good, food ok at best.  New Yorker is a classic art deco hotel from the 20's, beautiful inside and out.  Spend the timeto check out the architecture and the classic art and decor you won't regret it.Will be back a lot sooner! JM Boston;5
Always a pleasure. Nice clean rooms. Wonderful staff. Right in the heart of NYC. Historical and the Art Deco is beautiful. We arrived late on Tuesday and got an upgrade on our room. It was fantastic. Lovely view over the city and a nice escape from the crowds.;5
Found the hotel excellent, great history to it, Tesla lived here for 10 years, close to time square, opposite madison square garden and subway, can see the Empire State Building really close by. Only downside if your Irish no kettle in room or fridge for the cup of tea😂 and the taxes were a bit much, €120 dollars per room for five nights;5
Excellent hotel in a superb location. If you are arriving by train-Penn is one block from this hotel. The New Yorker has the quickest check-in of any hotel I have stayed at. Maybe 45 seconds is all it took. Very secure hotel as you will be asked to show your room key before getting on elevator. Gorgeous lobby that includes a 24 hr diner. If you need a taxi, they are usually right out front or the doorman will gladly pull one over. The rooms are very nice with powerful showers. Slept great-no noisy hallways. The New Yorker is close to so many attractions. Empire State Bldg being 2 blocks away which is perfect if you are looking to go to the observation deck late. Short walk back to this hotel. Directly across the street will be Starbucks, McD's, and a pizza shop. I usually stay;5
We picked this hotel because of the proximity to Madison Square Garden. We didn't realize how close it was which was awesome!!! Parking is a short walk away in an underground facility. The hotel charges a facility fee. Not happy about that. There wasn't a pool or jacuzzi to use and we didn't use the business center. Basically, the discount on our parking ($30) we ended up paying for with the facility fee ($29). Plus there are taxes on the facility fee! The room was nice. Reminded us of a cruise ship room. Very small but clean. The door to the bathroom did not close, not even close to being able to close. The shower leaked onto the bathroom floor. Metro view is a view of the other side of the hotel. Would we stay there again? Possibly but I would look around since there are other;4
Subway stops on both sides, in the middle of everthing, 10 minutes walk to Times Square, 250 m away from the Madison Square Garden, what can I say? The room was small and we didn't like the bathroom, there was no kettle and minibar. But I would probably stay again due to its location and cleanness.;3
Our stay was very pleasant, we traveled with a group. Everyone enjoyed our time at the New Yorker. All rooms are equipped differently- 1 room had a fridge & microwave the other rooms did not. 2rooms offered robes & another room had a terrific view of the city;5
the hotel has a great location, and holds 2 restaurants but the rooms were very small and it's an old building. There isn't much to explore if you're looking for historic New Yorker hotel stuff. The staff was great.;3
My best friends wedding and my 50th Birthday so we wanted to stay somewhere nice, so we did. The New Yorker is one of the city’s oldest and most classic hotels. This Art Deco hotel has been preserved and is well located in midtown (34th street) We had a suite high up facing the river with a large balcony directly under the red New Yorker sign which could have been used for a party if we’d been organised. We found the staff friendly and interested. We’d definitely return to this hotel. Aside, New York has changed a great deal since I stated going in 1995 and in recent years, a range of local city taxes are now a standard feature on all hotels bills - expect a quarter of your bill to be additional taxes so something to bear in mind when booking a hotel room, particularly one in a;4
Stayed at this lovely hotel for 5 nights. The location is excellent . Madison Square Gardens,Penn Station and the Subways. You are approx 20 mins walk from Times Square and also the Empire State Building and Macy’s is 10 mins Walk.The staff were excellent and nothing was to much trouble. The room was very pleasant and in Art Deco style and had a bath and shower.Our room was cleaned daily to. There is always a security person checking to make sure you are a resident at the hotel before you get into the lift . There is a fitness suite which guests can access. Do not forget the taxes charge for your stay. The staff will explain this more to you.There is a dinner and another bar attached to the hotel. Down stairs there is the hotels vault bar and dining area which is set in a piece;5
"First time in NYC for both my daughter (we're from Philly) and my fiance' (he's a transplant from NOLA), and I truly don't think we could have found a better place to begin and end our adventures. We started off with a room booked via groupon- but it  was not able to accommodate us. In floats ( seriously, she was so amazing, I would swear she was floating!) Gabina, and with no muss or fuss, and a world class personal touch, she was able to find us perfect accommodations. We had a suite with two bathrooms, and beds so comfortable, my daughter would tell you she had the best night sleep of her life (she's eleven:-)). Central to Times Square; Madison Square Garden, and literally a block down from Penn Station, we were able to have a wonderful time exploring and just walking around";5
From check on to check out, the staff was extremely friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. The Customer Service Manager went above and beyond and accommodated my friends and I during the check in process, he gave us complementary continental breakfast and allowed a later check out time. I will be back for the year is over, it was like home away from home and I actually live in NYC!! :)));5
This hotel is about 1 block from Madison Square Garden and about 4 blocks down and two blocks over to Times Square.  I am a Wyndham rewards member so I was upgraded to a room that was updated.  It's a typical NYC hotel room with a small bathroom (don't plan on having much room to store anything) and a desk, chair, small closet and king size bed.  My colleague had access to the free breakfast on the 39th floor but after checking it out, we went to the Tick Tock Diner in the main lobby instead.  If you are worried about safety, there are security guards that make sure you have your key out each time you go to the elevators so no one can just walk off the street and head up to a floor. I gave it 4 stars because the lobby area is a bit small and outdated so when you walk in you are;4
We had a nice stay at the New Yorker Wyndham Hotel last week.   Check in was easy, we liked that there were security guards making sure that no people who didn’t belong were going up in the elevators. The room was quite large. We had two queen beds, plenty of room to move around for a married couple and our adult son. The tick-tock diner on the ground floor was great for breakfast, the Italian restaurant on the other side was great for supper. You never actually had to leave the hotel, but if you wanted to, Penn station was right around the corner. We took the train in and rolled our suitcases right off the ramp onto the sidewalk And walked for about a half a block to get into the hotel. We had to ask for a coffee maker, but it was delivered quickly.  There is a McDonald’s right;5
We stayed 3 times and will be stay another 3 times.. Main reason for first stay was Tesla!!! But aftet,we loved location,places,foods,rooms etc..  Stayed 2 times room mumber 3327 because of Nikola Tesla. Walk away to all points of interest!!!Little bit old but smells history everywhere.  İf the money is not imporyant for you,just go and enjoy +++++;4
Great atmosphere and staff. Will definitely be back! The room was larger than any other I’ve stayed in in NYC and I visit about 4 times a year. The added security of checking room keys before guests entered the elevators was very comforting. Come on, it’s New York!;5
We had booked to stay five nights at the New Yorker as a family - service was faultless from the minute we arrived. (Do make sure if you stay to check out the little museum on the lower ground floor - lovely quirky feature with lots of hotel history!) Our room was prepared quickly as we had arrived earlier than expected and the room itself was perfect for the four of us - much larger than I was expecting. Staff could not have been more helpful - when our flight home was cancelled at short notice and we needed to stay another night, they made sure we were able to keep our room, despite being very busy - hugely appreciated during a very stressful time - thank you, Wyndham New Yorker!;5
This historic hotel is a perfect lovely place to stay if you’re doing business at the Javits Center-only a two block walk. The diner on the first floor isn’t quick and delicious for a quick bite before you head out to your meetings.;5
Small bed for two.  No toiletries at all.  After checking out we decide to leave the bags with the bell service while we had breakfast. They charged us $2 for each bag.  Poor service.  So crowded every time you go to your room need to show your key to security.;3
We stayed here for one night as a stop over to meet up with a cruise the following day. i and my family could not fault the hotel the room the view or its location. The only let down was the facility charge that we were not informed about. We had no knowledge that we would be charged this fee for a service that we did not use. When we booked in we should have been were of this charge. You pay a fee for a service you do not use.;4
We went on our first NYC trip last year (just getting around to writing a review) and stayed at this beautiful hotel, we weren't sure what to expect as we'd never been to NYC before but wow, as soon as you walk in it is so grand. We had a run in with one of the hotel staff members on the check in desk who was quite rude and abrupt and wasn't very good at explaining things so we ended up having to come down again after we'd realised something had gone wrong and talk to a manager as we were going to be out of pocket $200 with no warning whatsoever, and the staff member wasn't taking no as an answer, this was sorted promptly by the manager who couldn't have been more lovely. Although this is just a small niggle. The hotel itself is amazing and I would stay here again in a;4
This 4 starts hotel can not deliver fork & knife to your room. “If you really want them you can get them from the restaurant at the lobby”, that’s exactly what they told me. I have talked to the room service manager but unfortunately he also couldn’t make my simple order happen. Besides that, the room is not equipped with a water kettle and you can not have a hot cup of water delivered to your room.;1
I stayed at the New Yorker with my daughter November 2017, the hotel was clean and tidy and the bed was very comfortable. We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building which was a bonus, the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The bathroom could do with updating but apart from that I would definitely stay here again.;4
I started staying at the New Yorker hotel since 2004. I always was satisfied with everything at the hotel. The staff has come to know me well. It’s clean and comfortable and fairly nice and very very accessible to everything.;4
Very bad experience in this hotel... When we made the reservation, we could not select a single room because of the crib so we reserved a double room, we asked for a nice room for our wedding travel and a crib on the reservation. When we arrived at 4 am after 12 hours trip we had a single room ?!! whithout crib on the 8th floor (818) (there are 40 floors...) we waited for almost 1 hour for the crib with a baby really tired. The second day, we asked for an other double room as we reserved, we had it (2523 25th floor) but whithout the crib, we waited again more than an hour to have it at 11 pm. I had to call 4 times...  Furthermore, for the wedding day I asked 3 times on 2 days some stuffs for my hairdresser, every time they told me they will bring everything in the room, I never;1
We stayed here when we visited the Empire State building so the location was perfect and very convenient. The room was a bit small (even for NYC hotel) but the staff was very friendly and accommodating. We were able to see the top of the Empire State building from our (very small) window but it was a beauty to see at night. The showers need a little more pressure. Overall it served the purpose.;3
Clean. Comfortable bed. Wonderful service- staff try very hard to please. Breakfast good variety. View from our room 19th floor amazing. Pool excellent view.Unbelievable excessively loud music comes from gig over the road every night until 11pm- even shook our windows! Ear plugs made no difference. Is a real shame as means will no go back to this amazing  property or recommend to others. The local organiser needs to respect tourists and the money they bring into area;4
We spent four nights in the New Yorker and enjoyed our stay in this very attractive hotel. Our room was quite small and I'm not sure the view was worth the extra that we paid, but the air conditioning was wonderful and it was clean and comfortable. The staff that we met were friendly and helpful.;4
This iconic Art Deco hotel is set in a cracking position, handy for the sights and easy access to the subway. Comfortable beds clean rooms pleasant and efficient staff, Tesla stayed here for quite a while back in the day, in fact he died here.;5
This hotel is in prime location for shopping next to Harold square and Macy’s. Every time we walked out of the hotel we looked up and you can clearly see the Empire State Building it’s like a block away. Rooms are remodeled very up to date, Beds were comfortable, staff is amazing it is very clean. Some people mentioned no coffee pot in room so I requested it when I made my reservation and see the pictures I was stocked up with water, tea and coffee.;5
The director of the hotel Barry did an amazing job with my Boyfriend's 50th birthday!!! From the incredible room/ view to the birthday decorations, candy, and cake!!! Best hotel in NYC!!! We will be back;5
This hotel has huge brightly lighted and clean lobby. Great location with a view but the room is small and there is no soundproof walls and doors. Was awaken a few times people walking along the hallway.;3
We were allocated a room on the 30th Floor that had recently been renovated. Room was small but very nice. No refrigerator so had to go to 28th Floor for ice machine. 28th floor looked a little shabby. The location was great, close to Maddison Square Garden, Penn station, lots of other attractions and shopping area. I dont know why they charge a resort fee??;4
I stayed because I didn't get a chance to take a vacation because I started another job but I had a great time with my fiance.This hotel is a great place to stay so you can get away for awhile and take a breather from stress. Prices are great and the sites are wonderful. People are friendly and the food in the area is great. I stayed in alot of hotels in Manhattan and this one is one of my top 5. I enjoyed myself.;5
Spent 4 days at the New Yorker and found it to be a very pleasant hotel within a great location. Room size was more than adequate for a hotel in a prime location. Furthermore the views I had from the room were fantastic. Undoubtedly I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.;4
I had good expectations of this hotel with its 4* status - but I was really disappointed. The check in process was slow, and although I was pre-warned about charges on arrival, it was a big chunk of money to pay for 2 rooms for 3 nights - still waiting to see if the refund arrives as promised. The room was the most disappointing - old and dated and not enough space to swing a cat.  Two people in the room with nowhere to store suitcases meant there was no space to move.  Small bed - although comfortable - and very noisy air conditioning.  The bathroom was tiny and needed updating.  A lot of noise came in from the streets 25 floors below. However the big selling point for this hotel is its location - it is right in the centre of the tourist area with Empire State, Times Square and;3
Great location.  You name it, it is right near CVS, Starbucks and etc. I would definitely stay again.  Super convenient to subway.  Love the fact need to show room key to access elevator. Only downfall is no refrigerator in the room.;4
After a long trip to get to NY and looking it, Mohammed at the check in desk was just super gracious in finding me a room even though it was before standard check in time.  His recognition of my need at the moment had him going above and beyond to take care of a guest.  Can't thank him enough for the excellent service. Even called the room to make sure everything was to my liking.;5
We had another wonderful stay at the New Yorker !!   Our room was very clean and had a wonderful view of the city !!  Very easy check in and out, Jose was Great !! Great location, near Penn station and we were able to walk to several places we wanted to visit..;5
Walking distance to the theaters, close to Penn station and subway.   Room was a nice size for a NYC hotel.  I've stayed at more expensive and gotten much less.  Street was full of tourists and some homeless, so if you're looking for something quieter, this may not be for you, but we enjoyed our stay.;5
A very enjoyable hotel with priceless location for when travelling as a family to New York and interesting history. A point worth noting is the staff and service in this hotel, and more specifically, Mohammed who stood in the reception the night we wanted to check-in and improved our stay. Our room having a view of the Empire State, Madison Square Garden, and Chrysler Building also gave us an incredible view over three of the iconic buildings of Manhattan.;4
Room was old and very small although we booked suit. Room doors made too much noise from neighbors. Service was not good and took in some cases more 40 minutes to arrive. Breakfast does not include eggs or ham , just bread and some butter, cream cheese. Too crowded.if you arrive late you are busted  They charge for each bag when you store it in their store room. Great location.;3
The hotel location and appearance were excellent.  However, the check in process was awful!  We had to cancel our dinner reservations and almost missed our show time.  If you are coming to this hotel for a show, arrive the day before, not the day of, as check in cannot be guaranteed.  All other aspects of our stay were adequate.;3
"Our room was wonderful although the view was your topical NY roof tops.  it was within a couple minute walk from Penn station and 9 blocks from Times Square and the shows. There is the Tick tock ""diner"" attached to the hotel for breakfast and other meals, as well as a decent Italian restaurant for dinner. We had a wonderful time.  The only thing I'd recommend is that they paint the halls and rooms something brighter and up-to-date.";4
We stayed 5 nights at the Wyndham. On the positive side this hotel is in a fantastic location and our room was spotless and cleaned every day to a high standard. On the negatives our room was very small and quite dated and our view consisted of a brick wall so that was disappointing (if we did return I think I would pay the extra for a better view). Had breakfast in the tick tock diner twice and it was good and obviously very handy. Two drug stores and a McDonalds are right outside the hotel too.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who was new to the city who was looking for a central base.;4
I spent one week in this hotel and the only good things are the location (5 min walking from time square) and the view (my room was in front of Madison square garden). The building is so old and dirty, doesn’t look as a 4 star hotel. The restaurant is 4/10 points.;3
The New Yorker hotel is in the best location ever! About a 6 minute walk to Penn Station and pretty much in the middle of everything - Central Park is about 30 minutes walk away.   The lobby area was lovely and was home to a lot of Virgin crew! The staff at the hotel were friendly and we were explained the local taxes and everything we needed to know about the hotel. Very nice as a lot of hotels fail to tell you about this until the end!   Our room was on the 20th floor and was slightly on the small side, but for the amount of time we spent in the room that really wasn’t a problem. The room was spotless, bed was really comfy and shower was powerful. What more could you ask?  We had an issue with the WiFi during our trip but after chatting with the lobby staff, they were very;5
"From the outside; this hotel looks amazing. The lobby is quite beautiful and designed in a distinct Art Deco style reminiscent of the 1920s. The location of the hotel is ideal for anyone visiting the city - it is literally right next to the Empire State Building and Penn Station subway which grants you access to all of Manhattan.   However it should be noted that the rooms are very basic. Our double room was quite small, and despite being 32 floors up the distinct sounds of sirens and traffic horns could still be heard. The air conditioning was effective but loud during the night which, if a light sleeper, could be irritating.  Security staff beside the lifts also lacked good 'customer service'. Always asking quite abruptly to see our room key to prove we were staying at the";3
I had stayed only for one day at the New Yorker hotel, and my experience was great. It was a twin bed room, waking up to the most beautiful view of New York City (picture attached).   Let me rewind back a little bit though, on booking sites, the initial price was $200, with taxes, etc. it came to $270. At check-in I was forced to pay an additional $31 per day for premium wifi (mandatory payment). I was just not happy that I got surprised with these fees at check in and that was the only thing that ruined it for me.  Over all stay was good, the hotel rooms cleanliness would score 6/10;3
My daughter found this hotel, which is based in the Hells Kitchen area of New York city, situated on 34th Street.  During our stay here we visited the on site restaurant Tick Tock  which was a tipical New York style cafe style with booths. Food was very nice and reasonably priced.   We stayed on 25th floor   The room was of  a good size, with an extremely comfy bed. Bath/Shower room, was clean and tidy, although paint work could do with a little attention here and there.  Staff were very helpful. Hotel also has a gym.  Good access to subway station across the road, also many good places to eat close by.   Would recommend this hotel;5
Great hotel, staff are so polite and always helpful.  Cannot wait to stay here again, this hotel won’t disappoint you.  The location is amazing right outside Madison Square Gardens perfect location for those travelling to New York for the first time.;4
The room was clean, suitable to our needs and view was fascinating. Food in your facility was great same as cocktails. Location is perfect. We hot weather last weekend we missed only pool with a gorgeous view.;5
Check in staff were just great ! We loved are stay - had a nice room on 34 th floor and the view of the Chrysler  building!  It is so central and that worked out great for us - if we ever go back to NYC.- we know where to go !!;5
I arrived really early and had a busy day of apartment hunting.  I pre-checked in, leaving my luggage. My day was hectic, I returned to the hotel to discover what seemed like 300 people checking it. After a brief wait I was directed to someone to check me in. I retrieved my luggage, went to my room to unwind. I received a call from the manager asking if I needed anything. Please for the personal service. I would absolutely stay at The New Yorker again.;5
Great value for money, the room was large and clean, the staff were very friendly and very helpful. I’ve stayed in a couple of different hotels in NYC and this was by far the best. Could not recommend this hotel enough.;5
Stayed for a week with my mum in a queen room, the room was small but had the essentials.  Great location - walking distance from Times Square, Empire State Building, Penn Station, Madison Square Gardens.  Hotel is a bit dated but this adds to the history of the building.  Ate the Tick Tock diner next door a few times, nice food, very generous portions.  Concierge desk was very helpful for buying tickets (I recommend the Grey Line open top bus) and helped us with directions on the metro.;4
Perfect  location. You are able to walk pretty much everywhere (we even walked to Battery Park etc, although I would not recommend doing so in the august heat!!)  Across the street from Madison square garden and a few bars. Minutes from times square or the empire state. A few blocks away from Hells Kitchen. You must check out the High Line as this is also not far.  Clean hotel which has friendly and helpful staff. The lady on reception upgraded our room to a room with a view, we didn't ask she just did it for free.  The bed was very comfy. Room small and basic but did include wardrobe space, draws, iron, ironing board, hairdryer and safe. The hotel charges $2 per bag if you need to store them prior to check in or after check out.  The hotel can book you a private taxi to the;4
Mohammed was exceptionally helpful and went the extra mile for my guests and myself.  We are very pleased with his promptness and professional manner in obtaining a room earlier than expected.  Thank you, will return in near future!;5
We got a room with a view and it was an OUTSTANDING view.  We paid a bit extra for it but it was worth it.  We got a suite for our family and we were quite comfortable.  I was able to work while the family hung out and we had a good amount of space.  Bathroom is small, but our suite had a sink otherwise in it that came in very handy.;5
My daughter and arrived for a 2.5 day NYC treat. After flying s birds eye flight from Denver we arrived 2 hour before checkin. Muhammad at the desk gave us polite and efficient service and even upgraded us to a 40th floor suite. We enjoyed our stay, this being my second time in The New Yorker I will definitely go back!;5
Hotel was right in the center with Madison Square Gardens. The room was fine.The staff wasn´t very nice. And people need to be careful because they charge lots of taxes. Located just accros the Penn station.  The staff was not very nice but give you the information you need.   The speed and stability of the free internet was bad. Nice bar but continental breakfast included was very poor. Another thing  not so positive was that when you leave if you ask to keep  your bags, you have to pay a fee.;3
For my wife's 50th birthday we went to New York city for a week. Stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker & the stay was fabulous! The staff really made an effort to say Hi as you were coming in or going out. The room was small, but in the city I think you'll get that anywhere. The trip was excellent as well as our stay. Thanks to everyone there that made my wife's 50th & her great to get to the Big Apple everything we hoped it would be.;5
The whole hotel smells awful the place is dark and dinghy, the walls are dirty, the pillows are like rocks and the bed has a hole in the center. And we got an up grade! Checking out too awful to stay.;1
I had high expectations of this hotel as it has been recommended via lots of different social media channels. The hotel is a wonderful art deco old New York Hotel and I’m sure it could tell many a story of people staying here in the past.  I would recommend you ask for a higher floor as we were on the 7th floor and the view from the room was disappointing, nothing to see! Having seen amazing pictures on line, I can only imagine you would have to pay a great deal to have any decent view.   The rooms are small, and I know NY is renowned for this as space is a premium. My biggest grip was that there was not enough space for 3 cases and you couldn’t hang much in the tiny wardrobe. We shared with my daughter so effectively 3 adults with nowhere to open our cases other than throwing;3
Very well located. The rooms are dirty and the feanitures are too old. You should to clean up before enter and if you will spend a long time there maybe will be a good ideia buy your oun pillow and mettress.;3
We stayed almost two weeks at the hotel. The overall impression of the hotel is that it is a hotel we would recommend.  The reason for our recommendation are: 1) Central location. Located just accros the Penn station. 2) The staff was very helpful. Mohammed was especially helpful. Our son had some medicin that required to be kept at max 5 degrees celcius. Mohammed arranged that we could get a refrigerator brought up to our room. 3) The speed and stability of the free internet was good. 4) Nice bar  The only not so positive was: 1) The bathroom was not so big 2) The hotel looked a bit worn.  It's a hotel we would use again in case we come back to New York.;4
Just come back on the 20th July after 5  days, 10 women and what a time we had. Saw everything that we wanted and more.  Hotel was right in the center with Madison Square Gardens across the road, Macy's and Empire State just a 10 minute walk away. Penn Station also across the road which we used a lot to get us to ground zero and Central Park. Times Square just 2 blocks away 15 minute walk no need to get a cab. We had 3 rooms in all, 2 with 3 people in and 1 room with 4 of us. Our room with 4 in was fine, we had 2 double beds, air con (much needed)bathroom was fine and a small built in wardrobe. The room was fine as we did not spend much time in it other then to sleep. The Hotel is in an Art Deco design which I imagine was the fashion when it was built. Dinner, bar and Steak;4
Stayed here five nights and had a pleasant stay. Overall the staff was so friendly (from the cleaning staff to the doormen) we were pleasantly surprised. The location can’t be beat. Right across the street from Penn Station, so the whole subway system was easily accessible. Our standard room was small (as we expected for Manhattan), but it was in need of some updating.  Fresh paint would do wonders. For the price, I would stay here again.;4
This hotel is in a fabulous location, close to Penn station and tube lines and close to Empire State Building. Down sides were that it was extremely busy which led to queues to check in, queues for lifts (today one bank of elevators broke down). We were upgraded to an outer room with windows (didn’t know you could end up in a room with no windows so watch out for that!).  There were 3 of us sharing and it was a tight fit. No fridge, TV signal not great, and shower wasn’t great.;3
Great location easy to reach all parts of New York. Rooms clean, tidy and plenty of space. Check Inn was little slow could have put etc staff on. Quiet room with all you'd expect from hotel of this standard;5
Amazing location, amazing staff I couldn’t find a fault with this hotel if I tried. Keep up the good work. The lady on the front desk made sure we had the most perfect room with a view.  Also made sure we had two beds, which is what we wanted for two friends away on holiday.  Will differently be staying there again.;5
We had a fantastic stay at The New Yorker. The location was great, we arrived by cab due to landing late, however it is adjacent to Penn Station so we could easily have got the train in from the airport and saved some money (we did get the train back). There are wonderful views of The Empire State Building, and the hotel is a view itself. The internal decoration of the building is a perfect example of original art deco and it was a delight to take in this theme in every last detail throughout the hotel. Everywhere in central Manhattan is within walking distance from the hotel, and we found plenty of great places to eat and drink.   We would definitely stay here again, and hopefully will.;5
Stayed her Aug. 1st to Aug 4th with my family of 4 and it was awesome. Clean rooms, great location, great staff. There are so many places around the hotel with a subway station right next door, which is 1 stop from time square. The security is strict no entry without a key and the decor is beautiful.  The staff was helpful and our room was cleaned every evening when we returned.;4
"Nice hotel in Times Square.  Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are steps out the entrance.  The minute you walk out of the hotel you are in the ""thick"" of NYC - people and action everywhere morning and night.  If you are looking for a quiet location, this is not it.  We heard that the rooms are small, but we stayed the New Yorker twice in June and both times had large (by NYC standards) rooms - possibly because we are Wyndham Rewards members.  The rooms were updated and well appointed.  The bathrooms are very small, however, with only elbow room and not space to keep a toiletry bag - other on a towel shelf.  Other than that, the room was great!  If you want to be in the center of NYC action as well as a nice hotel for a reasonable price, the New Yorker is it.";4
Great Hotel with everything you need! 2 minutes from Penn Station and Subway access next to hotel. The suite we had was very spacious and the view from our giant balcony was amazing! We had friends visit and the room easily accompanied several more people. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful.They mapped out our tourist destinations and gave us good recommendations. Tick Tock restaurant was good for quick breakfasts and dinners. After a long day of walking with the kids we ordered food to go. They do have two other restaurant options. The beds are super comfortable and the AC works great. We will definitely return back to The New Yorker!;5
I booked  this hotel for 5 nights On our  arrival the room was not ready yet but the guy at reception desk Mohammed finally granted us to another room We were upgraded to an upper room on 36th floor with a great view on the empire state buildin ,thanks a lot. The new Yorker hotel is very well located in midtown perfect to visit the town.;4
We had lovely stay at the New Yorker. Warm & efficient staff. Great room. Dinner at the Tick Tock Diner was good. Make sure you take the escalator down to the lower level lobby to check out the history of of the hotel. Looking forward to coming back.;5
So my family and I stayed at the New Yorker in Manhattan (8th Ave) this past weekend (07/28/18-07/29/18). We were on the 31st floor, room 3108. 2 double beds, a tv, small bathroom and a very nice view. Because there are 5 of us ( 2 adults and 3 kids) I knew that the 2 double beds would not be enough so we took our air mattress since our 3 y.o. sleeps with my husband and me. I was happy to see that there was enough space to put the air bed so we all slept comfortably. All in all not a bad stay. We had a lovely time. Will post some pics here. Took these at the time we were leaving so please excuse the mess!;4
Location is superb, really do feel in the thick of it. On top of Madison Square Garden, very close to the Empire State and a short walk to Times Square.  It has a lot of history the New Yorker, which is a pro and a con. The pro is that you do feel like you are staying in a classic New York hotel the only problem is you are used to a modern world. The hotel needs modernizing, Lifts, certain decor and the breakfast restaurant/cafe.   The best part of the hotel is the upmarket restaurant in the basement of the hotel, which is a converted bank vault. Lovely food and great service . The worst part was the Reception/Check in and out, slow, slow, very slow. The people behind the desk seemed as if the computers were a new development which of course for America this is especially not;3
"We stayed on the 39th floor July 24-30. Excellent view from our room of the Freedom Tower. Comfortable bed, although sons said the pull out bed couch and rollaway bed weren't that great. TVs were flat screen but picture not sharp. They also didn't get the Yankees or Mets games. I mean if you're gonna call yourself The New Yorker...  Bathroom was fine although the toilet was very low...just off the ground. I'm 5'10"" (avg build) and I felt like a giant sitting on it. Shower was good. Doorknob on bathroom door would come off. I told the housekeeper but it never got fixed.  Biggest financial negative was getting hit with a USD 45 per day “facilities fee” on departure. I knew about this, but it still stinks. New Yorker said it was to cover wifi, gym and business centre - the only one";4
We stayed here for 5 nights on our 3rd visit to NYC. We chose the New Yorker for its location and its iconic status. We weren’t disappointed with either. We had booked a suite and although smaller than some we have stayed in we were very comfortable there with everything we needed for our stay. Check in and reception staff were always friendly and courteous and obliged us with a late check out for our last day. The housekeeping staff were efficient and reminded us the sodas in the fridge were complimentary. The room was spotless and cleaned daily. The location was perfect for getting uptown and downtown - we walked to most places but there is easy access to the subway if needed. When we return to New York I would definitely stay here.;5
Stayed on the 39th floor and we had a very good view of the manhattan skyline. Room was dated in terms of AC and TV but nonetheless a comfortable sleep since we were only staying for a night. There’s a CVS pharmacy right beside the hotel and you can even walk to madison square garden and times square under 10 minutes.;4
Located close to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, a short walk from midtown and theaters.  The room was small but very clean and comfortable.  The people at the front desk were very helpful and kind.  We were checked in early and given a room with a view of the Empire State Building without even asking.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again.;5
We recently stayed there for a couple of nights and it was fantastic. The rooms were clean and beds very comfortable.  The nighttime views of the empire State building were breathtaking! Nice restaurant next door with excellent food.  Would definitely be staying with them again!;5
Had five days at the New Yorker in July. Location very central and a great base for sight seeing.  Is a grand old hotel but could do with a coat of paint to bring it back from looking tired and dated.  Staff were great Our room was spacious and the views from our room on the 22nd floor were exceptional.  Only real negative was getting slugged with a USD 45 per day “facilities fee” on departure. We had prepaid our stay well in advance and did not expect this fee. They said it was to cover wifi, gym and business centre - none of which we actually used.;3
Stayed at this hotel in July as part of a trip to celebrate my 50th birthday. We had chosen this hotel based on its location as it stands on the corner of 8th Avenue and West 34th Street so is close to Macy's and the Empire State Building. Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are across the road and Times Square is about 10 minutes walk away. There are a number of subway stations nearby so the whole of Manhattan is accessible. The hotel was opened in the 1930s and in keeping with its style, the rooms are not massive - a bit of a squeeze for three adults but we managed. We had a lovely view of the Empire State Building. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. The hotel could do with updating and the decor was looking a bit drab. There was a safe and we hired a;3
"Last week marked my third annual stay at the New Yorker a Wyndham Hotel.  It is a large, lively, hotel that offers a boutique feel.  The hotel is steeped in history, boasting guests such as Joe DiMaggio, Muhammad Ali, and Nikola Tesla, who made the New Yorker his home for a solid decade.  Rooms are small, reflecting the time period in which the hotel was built; they are also extremely clean.  The wonderful staff are the heart and soul of the New Yorker.  This past week when I arrived I felt as if I was returning home.  I hope that next summer will mark my 4th annual trip.";5
This hotel was recommended by my travel agent. I told him I wanted a clean, comfortable hotel, with high standards. My first impressions walking into reception were good. When I went to get the lift it changed. This hotel is filthy dirty. Desperately needs updating and attention. The rooms are tiny. The door couldn’t open fully without touching the bed. The room accessories and furniture were awful. The shower was terrible. The tiles had been painted over again yet there were bits of the original tile showing. The silicon around the bath was black, the grout in the tiled floor was filthy. There was a plastic covering stuck on the bathroom window which was pealing off and very messy. The net curtain was grey with dust. My fiancé was getting into bed and a big ball of hair was;1
The building is a classical New York City building and so does it shows at the interior where hallways look as if it is in need for an upgrade. Most of the bedrooms offer lots of space and so do the bathrooms. The beds offer good nights of sleep also thanks to the box spring mattresses. Street noise is unavoidable which suggest to bring a pair of earplugs for the lighter sleepers.  Breakfast was included in our package which was served at the diner. Waffles, maple syrup pancakes and scrambled eggs and this for the five days of our stay, is not exactly my idea of a healthy breakfast.  Everything is within walking distance, Time Sq, Penn Station, the Jacob Convention Center.  Overall a good place to lay your head, especially when you're in need of lots of zzz's to run a good;4
The New Yorker is a large, bustling, international, conveniently located hotel. The appearance and ambiance very much reflect the Art Deco period during which it was built. My granddaughter and I landed there because this was the hotel included in our tour .A few people in our group seem to have been assigned small rooms.  We lucked out. Our room was spacious, pristine and much more attractive than website photos would indicate. The burnished gold satin headboards, brown, white and gold color scheme and lovely light fixtures all resulted in a very handsome room. The tables, desk and easy chairs made our already nice room even more comfortable. The housekeeping along with the housekeeping staff were excellent.In fact, staff members across the board were helpful and professional.;4
The New Yorker is a great place to stay! It is in an excellent location, extremely clean, beautiful, and has a wonderful staff. When we had to check-in early because our flight arrived early in the day, the lady at the front desk was able to get us one of the best rooms we could ask for so that we could get checked in and our vacation started. We can hardly wait to come back! Great value for Manhattan, Times Square.;5
I booked this holiday through expedia, and as I was doing my first solo trip to New York I wanted something that was close to some of the main tourist places as well as being close to the subway and restaurants.  This was my 3rd trip to New York, and I was looking forward to the break and just being able to have some time to myself.  Unfortunately my transfer from JFK took longer than anticipated so by the time I got to the hotel I was tired, hot and hungry.  It was after 9pm, so when I got to the hotel I was relieved to see there wasn't a queue, even more relieved when I was taken to the VIP desk where there is a seat, not because I was a VIP.  I sat did the usual explained that I was so tired after a nightmare journey, she seemed pleasant and just breezed me through check-in.;3
Staying at an icon can be a lovely experience, but doing so may come at a cost to quality and updating. The 'Old Lady' sits in a great part of town, just a few minutes walk to so many amazing places. Loved our experience but the rooms and floors were well used and tired.;3
We were blown away by The New Yorker. Our room was clean, comfortable, and conveniently located - 2 short blocks from Penn Station and 3 long blocks from the Empire State Building (we could even see the Empire State Building from our room). We felt very welcomed and well cared-for. :);5
The hotel is well positioned and staff friendly but the rooms need a bit of an update - rust on fittings in our bath room. Also $50 resort fee per night is a joke and makes u feel the hotel is ripping you off;2
Location great across from Penn Station food great breakfast, lunch, dinner very tasty service great courteous and kind and very helpful I would stay here again if I was to come back. Time Square close;4
We had the opportunity to share a magnificent city with our children for a week. We couldn’t have picked a better place to call home during our visit! Like NYC this hotel provides rich history (Take a quick stroll down the escalator). If you can appreciate how old these buildings are in NYC then you will love this place. The lobby is clean and bright. The staff is warm, inviting and friendly. They were very welcoming to our children also! We had a two room suite with two beds and a pull out couch. Our room was clean and recently updated! There were two walk in closets, I used one as my dressing room (I have three boys and this gave me great privacy). There was a fridge and, my favorite, a coffee maker. When we ran out of coffee pods and needed extra towels Staff promptly;5
We stopped here for a week July 18 and found the hotel and staff to be fabulous. The tick tock dinner is also a great place to eat. 5 stars from me.   A special thank you to Mohammed on reception who rang a couple of time to check everything was ok. We also enjoyed a great view from our room.  The butcher and banker was also a nice quiet break from the crazy streets of New York  I would happily stop there again;5
Had a great view of the city from my room. The staff is very friendly and helpful. If you want 2 bathrooms in your suite you need to ask for it upon arrival or during the reservation period. 1 block from Penn Station which was great. close to Time Square and other sites.;4
This is a lovely hotel, albeit the decoration is a bit tired.  I travelled with my daughter, my friend and her daughter. When we got there, we went to our room which was very pleasant. However, it had a bad smell. Seeing as it was late and we had spent the day travelling, we went to bed and hoped it would be fine by the morning. When we awoke to find it was still a bit smelly, I went to reception to ask to change rooms. They were very accommodating. They had a room that would accommodate us all, but on checking it out, I thought it was too small. I went back to reception and told them this, so they arranged another room for us. However, it wasn’t recast at that point, and we wanted to go out. They therefore asked us to pack up our cases and leave them in our room, and then they;4
First and foremost, the location is great.  It's easily accessible to Amtrak, LIRR, & several subway lines.  There is a parking garage in the immediate area if you choose to drive.  The Front Desk staff was very friendly and even gave me a free upgrade to my room. There is plenty of Security staff throughout the lobby ensuring that you are a guest at the hotel. The room was a nice size, clean and very comfortable. Several people complain about the size of the room being a bit small, remember this is NYC.  All hotel rooms in NYC are going to be a bit smaller than the average size.The amazing Tick Tock diner is attached to the hotel with a great all day breakfast menu.  There lunch and dinner is pretty good there as well.  I will definitely be staying at the New Yorker during my;4
I’ve marked that I was here in Feb of this year when in actual fact it was Feb of last year I just haven’t gotten round to leaving a review until now. I absolutely loved the Wyndham New Yorker hotel. It’s cleanliness and old fashioned decor is out of this world. It’s location is super central in Midtown Manhattan just a stones throw away from Madison Square Garden. The location is also near to Times Square, Empire State building etc but still feels far enough away from the hustle and bustle of it all. The Tick Tock diner as well is fab for breakfast (never tried it at any other time throughout the day) and reasonably priced. I would recommend this hotel over and over again. So much so that I am bringing my Mum to New York for her first ever visit for her 60th in October and we;5
The best thing about this hotel is the location as it is in lower midtown and with a subway station beside it there is easy access to both uptown and downtown.   On arrival my first impression was that it is a very busy hotel with many people around but there were also a lot of staff and I was quickly through reception and to my room on the 32nd floor. Initially I was a bit disappointed with the room as it was quite small and the decor was dated but it did grow on me as the bed was comfortable, a/c worked very well and it was very quiet.  Staff on the whole were friendly although I found the concierge a bit grumpy. It might be his New York manner and he might have a lot to do with such a busy job but felt he could have been a bit more pleasant.  Would I return? Absolutely;4
The New Yorker is a fabulous hotel Situated in a central area ideal for getting about sightseeing Spacious rooms  Friendly staff who excel in customer service Lovely restaurant and cool bar to wind down in after excursions Definitely book again;5
It was our first time in NYC and we chose to stay in mid-town as it seems more easier to navigate. We were coming from JFK by train, this was a great location just next to Penn station.   The hotel, even though old (historical), has it's own character and very well maintained. Our room on the 33rd floor is not bad for NY standards, with a very comfortable bed and very clean bathroom.  It's not cheap, but considering it's location it was a good deal.;5
Choose this hotel because of it's proximity to Penn Station since we took the train from DC.  It's close to Times Square, theater district, Empire State, Macy's, restaurants, shopping and the subway.    The hotel is old but well preserved for the most part.  Historical spot that has maintained it's relevance.  Service is over top excellent at every encounter.  Tic Tock Restaurant is a great 24/7 diner. Amenities include a well equipped up to date fitness center.  Our room was your typical small NY queen but it was comfortable enough and met our expectations.  I would stay here again.;4
Just returned (6/7/18) from 6 days stay the hotel. This was our second time at the hotel and it hasn’t changed much over past 15 years.  First impression is good as it has a very nice lobby. The hotel is well located being within walking distance of  Times Square, Empire States Building, Grand Central Station and Macy’s. Penn St station is across the road and there is a McDonald’s across the road which is very useful for a quick coffee in the mornings.  The rooms are clean but small and very dated, they are badly in need of an update. We didn’t eat at the hotel as it was very expensive and there were other places close by which were better value.  In summary we would stay here again for the location, rooms however are not the hotel’s greatest selling point but this wasn’t a;3
Recently stayed here for our trip to New York, found the hotel to be fab! Right in the middle of everything.  Restaurants lovely, all the staff but one was friendly.. didn’t realise I needed my white room card, to be told rudely by a lady that I need to read the sign as it says always show your card or something... room was a little on the small side but we only slept in there.  Would recommend.;5
My daughter and I stayed at the New Yorker for two nights while visiting NYC...our room was small (which I knew ahead of time as they tell you the size of each room) and was very clean and just what we needed for our stay.  I thought the cost of the room was very reasonable compared to other hotels (I checked prices of hotels daily in the area).  Parking was valet with no in or out privileges but that worked for us.  The staff was outstanding! Always very  friendly and helpful.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze. We were very close to MSG (went to see Billy Joel) and many other attractions.;5
We booked this hotel as part of a deal so I wasn't actually expecting anything amazing in term of the hotel as the price was excellent.  And I was very surprised.   The hotel is clearly one of the older hotels and has been built for a long time.  Our room wasn't huge but bigger than I have stayed in in other hotels in manhattan.  The lobby, was nice, reception staff very good and check in was an overall good experience.  The corridors and rooms were dated but very clean and a maid visited daily.  They have a business room for guests to use which we used for booking printing tickets for sights etc. The location is fantastic.   For a mid price hotel, don't be put off - I would definitely return.;4
The staff was friendly and professional. Muhammed checked us in and upgraded me to a room on the 30th floor that had an outside patio which was truly an unexpected bonus for my daughter and I. A friend came to visit and lobby security gave me a quick call to make sure it was ok. Look past the small rooms to notice the deco details of the architecture, and you won't be disappointed.;4
Hotel Ithaca is a great hotel. Clean, friendly and close to the vibrant downtown. Very good breakfasts and fine service. Immensely enjoyed our “Girls Road Trip” three days.    The front desk was very helpful for directions and recommendations for places in the area. The recently redone rooms of the North Tower were very clean and pleasantly decorated. We were happy to have spent our stay there.;4
We arrived close to check-out and the hotel was fully booked, but Mohammad went the extra mile to find us a room so that we could check-in early.  The hotel is steps from MSG/Penn Station.  The room was clean and modern, though on the small side.;5
I stayed with my grandson at this hotel for a trip to introduce him to Manhattan.   There are several pros for booking 1.  The price is certainly excellent for New York  2.  The location is central for using the subway or attending plays  3. The elevators are quick and are enough in numbers that you don’t have to wait long ( one theater district hotel we booked in the past required almost 30 minutes to exit the hotel). 4. The security was visible. 5. The staff was pleasant, and check in was quick. 6. Housekeeping was conscientious, and rooms were clean.   The beds and linens were comfortable 7.  Our room on the 23rd floor had a fabulous view of the Empire State Building.  Cons: 1. There was no room service, and coffee machines must be requested for your room. There is no;3
We stayed for 9 nights, which I was kind of worried about at first but the price offered was unmatchable for a hotel of this kind. Once we arrived, we were told they upgraded us to a city view room, which is bit bigger and with a nice view of they Chrysler building, Empire State and MSG. The room was nice, the bed was comfy (although very tall!).  We arrived to see some concerts at Madison Square Garden so this was a perfect location, especially if you're planning to queue of go to the General Entrance (which is one street corner away from the hotel. There's a subway station just around the corner, a 24-hour CVS   and a Duane Reade just across the street, a Starbucks and a 24-hour McDonalds. There's an Italian restaurant, a cocktail bar and a Diner inside the hotel, which we;4
The hotel and staff were very pleasant. The rooms were a little small, but that’s NYC for you. Nothing bad, except for having ice machines and vending machines on certain floors. But all in all great experience.;4
My husband and I were attending a concert at Madison Square Garden.  The New Yorker is practically across from the venue.  We flew into JFK took the Air Train and LIRR.  That put us into Penn Station and that is next door.  We had views of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler building.  The Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel is quick and efficient with excellent food.  We had taken advantage of the great summer weather and walked to Central Park and fifth Avenue.  It could not have been easier.  Mohammed was great at the Wyndham Rewards desk and the best part was that my points covered the entire stay!!!;5
The New Yorker was exactly what we needed for our NYC weekend trip. We were in town for a show at Madison Square Garden. The hotel was close to Penn Station so navigating the city was easy. The hotel itself was clean, and the staff was friendly. Our room was small but was spacious enough for my husband and I. I would definitely stay here again.;5
I travel and stay overnight in Manhattan often, and every time I'll always only stay at the New Yorker or another Wyndham property. Hands down the best hotel experience I ever have. Always super friendly staff, check in is fast, and the rooms are always clean and perfect.;5
The room was very clean, the hotel was beautiful, the staff was very professional, pleasant, and knowledgeable. The New Yorker was a great stay. Valet service for parking your vehicle was great and getting securing taxi cabs was the best.;5
I arrived with 2 family members early in the morning after a 10-hour overnight flight. I was grateful that we were provided with a room as we were exhausted. The room had 2 double beds and a roll-away bed along one wall and a table and chair pushed against the opposite wall, leaving about 3 feet of space to walk from the beds to the small bathroom. The roll-away had to be entered from the bottom of the bed. That's how limited the space was. We picked this hotel because of its proximity to Penn Station, which has extensive subway connections. Because we were only staying 2 nights, I didn't try to change our room which was very uncomfortable. Otherwise, the hotel was old but okay.;3
We stayed at this hotel on the night of the 9th July as part of our holiday to celebrate our 50th birthday.  The hotel is very well situated and only a few minutes walk from Penn Station with plenty of subway connections and about 10/15 minutes walk from Empire State Building.  From arrival until departure we had fantastic customer service and were looked after really well. We were tended by a really nice lady at check in, who would only say “we had a really nice room” and she was ordering champagne for us to celebrate.  We were not disappointed. The room had a lovely living/dining area with separate bedroom. Very clean and extremely comfortable. It also had the added bonus of a balcony with views to World Trade Centre, Maddison Square Garden and Chrysler Building. Fabulous.;5
We  are finally home from the last of our vacations it's been wonderful.  New York was the best of them all thanks for treating us like royalty.  Now to get back to reality and the real world.  Highly recommend this place they go above and beyond to make your stay magical.;5
Stayed here on my travel agents recommendation. The location is great its right next to Madison Square Garden and heaps of shopping / food on 34th Street.  There is major station near by which can connect you to most lines. Its a 15min walk to 42nd street and Empire State Building.  2 small things that I didnt like about the hotel the TVs were too small in the rooms and were not on the best viewing angle when in bed. Also the bathroom fogs up heaps as there are no extractor fans in the bathroom.;4
I stayed there in 13th july. Everything was neat & clean. Staff were friendlly and helpful, especially the reception staff, Mr Mohammadi who was very kind and professional. He was five star staff. The location was great.;5
The hotel’s location is very central, right across from the street from Madison Square Garden. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Unfortunately, i found a few staff members to be lazy and rude. Both times I stayed in the New Yorker, the transportation manager (John?) who booked cabs for guests spoke to all guests, not just me, with sheer arrogance. Upon booking my taxi by card, he literally *threw* it across the counter back at me. Any small questions I asked were answered with a tone that he was being inconvenienced by simply having to do his job. In a nutshell, he was full of his own self-importance.;3
Couldn't praise every member of staff highly enough. Extremely obliging. Fantastic value. Perfect location. Rooms spacious and spotless. Great security. Great advice on tours etc. Doormen super friendly. An amazing experience.;5
The service all around was excellent. I arrived 3 hours earlier than expected and needed to clean up before a pressing appointment. While my room wasn’t ready, Muhammad, at the check in desk, took the time with me to find another room for immediate use. He said “it is never a problem. I will make some calls to see what we can do.” I find that attitude with all the staff at the New Yorker.;5
Very nice experience . We stayed during 4 nights .  The room is clear and good size. Check in and check out on time. Great location near Penn Station and walking distance for Time Square. Many good places for breakfast close.;5
We stayed 3-10 July.  Great central location.  We stayed on the 23rd floor and felt the corridor was rather dated as was our room.  It was very clean, great air con and shower.  Beds smaller than home (king size) were however comfortable.  Ideal location to get about.  We walked to a lot of locations from the hotel.  We found tic rock quite expensive and on our second occasions a bit pushy  and an expectation you would be back the next day(we went twice).  Liked the security of staff checking you were a resident of the hotel before allowing entry to the lifts.  Our biggest annoyance was the note through our door at 6am on our final day to tell us our resort tax was 170 dollars.  Our travel agent told us we wouldn’t need to pay it.  I felt the hotel could have given us more;3
We stayed for 4 nights at this central hotel within walking distance of major ny attraction.  Hotel was clean with very helpful staff.  My only complaint would be not having any tea or coffee making facilities in the room.;4
The New Yorker is situated near Penn Station and very convenient. Took our suitcases from the train and rolled on over there. Staff pleasant and we liked there was a person there checking our keys to make sure we were guests at the hotel before we got on the elevator.;5
Location is great. Staff is attentive and efficient. The hotel is clean and the rooms are spacious. Beds were comfortable-very important for jet lag recovery. Both on-site restaurants were good.   Would stay here again.;4
I really love The New Yorker hotel it's a comfortable place near to most things if you want to spend a few days as a holiday....clean( everyday housekeeping keep it clean all the time), we get a wide room....next time sure we will be there again.  But please just add a washing room to the hotel 😁;4
Flew in to Newark and got the train to Penn station which is 2 mins from the new yorker hotel, Checked in by Mohammed who gave us a room  on the 30th floor which has just been renovated, we knew this as when the lifts opened up on the other floors the carpets or flooring had not been changed and the corridors looked a little tired cheers mate, the room was clean and had a great view, there was only 3 of us in it, that was ok but any more and it would have been a squeeze. Staff were happy to deal with you and checking your door card before u can use the lifts is a great idea, their are also plenty of lifts so u never wait more than a minute or 2. New York is right on the door and the location was brilliant.;5
Perfect location for transport being close to Penn Station for airport and subway connections . Appreciated the history of the hotel, the basement museum was well done. Staff were welcoming and helpful, Five stars  to housekeeping staff, who were super pleasant..Room too small to fit luggage and clothes for two for a three week trip [stayed six nights at start of trip) not enough storage space, hangers etc, Added amenity charges annoying - if i have no use for a gym or an office why should this be added to the bill?;3
The website, building and lobby gave deceptive appearances because when we arrived in our room, the room had an outdated look.  I do not mean outdated meaning the 1920's, I mean outdated as an Econo Lodge or some off-highway motel.  My children thought they were in for a treat as they were when we visitied TRYP last year but, we were treated to a non-remodeled room with bare walls, old cupboards, cheap countertops, old tiles in the bathroom which had paint marks from poorly painted walls.  I lost 30,000 points on this horrible experience.  Will NEVER visit the New Yorker again!;2
Stayed at the Wyndham in New York for two nights after a twelve hour train journey. The hotel is in an idea location but the beds are the smallest we've ever slept in . They call them Queen size but beware they are only Four Foot wide!  Could hardly sleep even though we were exhausted after train journey. Complained too reception but was told all the rooms had the same size beds which we found hard to believe. The manager rung our room and gave us 50 dollars off of a meal in their restaurant .wont be staying there again and we stop over in New York a lot and found much better hotels nearby.;3
The room was quieter than I expected. The room, bed and even the pillows were small. Bathroom wasn’t functional and very small- no counter space, pedestal sink =water goes everywhere when washing your face, no towel rack and no vent/window that opens. The room is worn and outdated. Hotel desperately needs to renovated. Lobby and elevators crowded all the time. It smells old and musty. Do not stay here. The EVEN Hotel NY Time Square South around the corner is way nicer for a similar price!;2
We came into the city to see a concert at MSG. We wanted a good hotel that was close to the Garden. We could not have been happier. The concierge was friendly and checked us in. We stayed on the 27th floor with a view of the city line and river. Our room was just what we needed for our type of stay. (1 night). Although the hotel in general is very busy, our room was quiet and we had a great nights sleep. The bed was comfortable and the AC kept the room a perfect temp.  Yes, it was a little pricey for 1 night but you are paying for convenience and location so if you are okay with that, it is worth the stay and we will book again for any future events at MSG.;4
I stayed here in 2013 for my 21st birthday. Upon arrival we waited around 15 minutes to check into our room. When we got there we were disappointed... tiny room and the view was of a building maybe 15ft away from the window... so you couldn't see anything and there was no light coming into the room.  We phoned front desk and mentioned our unhappiness with the room and the manager advised us that if we sit tight tonight he will try do sort something the following day. The next morning we met with the manager who upgraded us to a suite which was incredible! Views across the entire city!  Had I of had a room like that I would have given it 5* but due to the first room I was given I can only give it an Average score.  In terms of location I would say it's around a 10 minute walk to;3
I stayed with my family(totally 4 of us) in a non-smoking executive room last week. I booked this because the description said it can accomodate 4 but it turned out the beds are smaller than regular queen size and it was pretty bad to sleep on them for the four of us. On top of it, the bathrooms are the smallest ever i have stayed. It's suitable only for 2 people, it should be listed accordingly, pretty disappointing.;2
train from Newark airport to Penn Station and a 2 minute walk to the hotel, in the room about an hour after collecting bags. View from the 32nd floor looking along 34th street to ESB, fantastic. Room clean and well tended. Staff at reception very helpful. They are quite proud of the history of the hotel and there is a small section of the downstairs lobby containing photos and posters of famous guests, Nikola Tesla lived the last years of his life there (science geeks like me will appreciate this). If you want somewher central I would strongly recommend the New Yorker.;4
Staff all really helpful and friendly. Restaurant lovely. Room (27th floor) was large, clean and quiet. Ask for a fridge to store water/milk (buy in 7/11 around the corner), we were quoted €20 for duration (really good value I thought) but no charge on checkout! Great spot in midtown Manhattan as a base.  Stones throw from Empire State, Madison Sq Gardens & Macy’s and very walkable distance to key attractions (Central Park, natural history museum, broadway, Times Square, Madame Tussaud’s, Bryant Park, intrepid museum, grand central terminal, top of the rock) with the exception of downtown (9/11,statue of liberty, Ellis island, Brooklyn bridge, financial district) But suggest you take 20 min walk and get a  water taxi thead there for a day out, great fun and very reasonable.;5
My daughter and I came in for the night, the front desk  were accommodating, however the room was not I expected. This is an older hotel- desperate for renovations, sheets were stained and the manager apologized, It was late so we asked for extra sheets and made the bed ourselves.;2
Lots of restaurant options, and friendly service. Rooms are typical in size of an older New York hotel - small but set up well.  It is clean but could use a refresh.  Conveniently located near Penn Station.;3
I booked this trip for my daughter’s 18th birthday present, before we arrived I e mailed the hotel to ask if we could have a room with a view as it was a special occasion. We arrived around 9pm NY time and were promptly checked in, the room although small had a nice view of Maddison square gardens and was on the 25th floor. I wasn’t bothered by the size of the room, we only showered and slept there. It was clean, tidy and the bed was comfy. Air con worked which was a god send as touching nearly 40 degrees on our visit.  The location is brilliant, walk to time square, Empire State, tube stations right outside too. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel as a whole very clean, it is an old building but reasonably decorated. We loved our time in NYC, the people are so;4
We arrived by train from Washington DC into Penn Station, the Hotel is less than a 5 minute walk. We were checked in quickly by Afroka, I said it was our 1st visit to NYC and any chance of a room with a bit of a view. Wow, we got one alright looking over the City to the Empire State Building, impressive during the day, spectacular at night. However noisy building work outside ruined our 1st nights sleep. At 4:00 am I went to reception to get a room change, without a great deal of hope as this is one busy Hotel. I spoke with Michael who was the very epitome of excellent customer service. He explained that the noise was outside of the control of the Hotel but said he would organise a room change the next day. It didn’t intrude into our busy schedule, we just packed our bags and;4
We had two nights at the New Yorker - in a pokey little room with a pokey little shower and no shelves anywhere in site.I suppose this is what you should expect two minutes from Macys and ten minutes from Times Square. A massive hotel just too busy for us. But the staff really are most helpful and smiley which means a lot for weary travellers.;3
Had a great stay here in June. Very busy time with summer and families at the hotel, along with NBA draft.  Room was quaint but had everything I needed. Had a rear facing view and could see the Hudson river. Quiet room on the back side.  Will stay here again on my next visit to NYC.;4
"I think one's feelings about this hotel will be related to the rate they pay.  I was here for the NYC triathlon, which wa just before the 4th of July and paid stay rates were $330 per night.  Fortunately I had Wyndham points to cash in, because no way was this hotel worth that.  By contrast, I weent across the river to Brooklyn-- 20 minutes by metro for the next 3 nights and paid $84 per night, though not as good I would not say only 25% as good- maybe 75%-80%? So again, depends on the rate. So I will give my pluses and minues from here and you can decide if these are helpful  + location (but almost anywhere in Manhattan is depending on why you are there; here you are by Madison Square Garden, Penn station with very short walk to Time Square /Rockefeller Center in one direction";4
This was a Coast to Coast birthday /bucket list trip starting in New York staying at the Wyndham New Yorker. Great location central to many major attractions, staff switched our room to a higher floor with view and comped us a breakast in the diner which we then used daily. Highly reccomend this Hotel. Top travel tips, take the Grayline City open top bus tour package, we got a 4 day pass for 2 people including a great Hudson River cruise, every guide had his own style but all were extremely informative and helpful. Walk to Times Square and find Ellens Stardust Diner, long line but worth the wait as all the servers are aspiring Broadway acts, literally belting out a moving ballad while serving tables, incredible night.;5
We recently spent 11 nights at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel, 8th Avenue.  Absolutely brilliant stay.  I couldn't say anything negative about the hotel.  Staff were pleasant and helpful.  The room was spacious and the view from our room was the Empire State Building.  Bathroom was great and shower was excellent.  The safe was free in the cost of the room and we paid $20 to have a fridge in the hotel room which was a big bonus - especially given the recent heat wave!!  Hotel is very central - right next to Penn Station and direct access to 6 subway lines - one stop from Times Square (easily walkable). There is a diner attached to the hotel and numerous eating places which are very accessible. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel - we as a family thoroughly enjoyed our stay;5
Amazing location with excellent service.  A fine location for a city trip. Room is small but has a nice bed for a rest after a long day in NYC. It is only a short walk to the empire state and is next to madison square garden and Penn station.;4
Couldnt ask for more from a hotel. Excellent location. Really clean room. Staff were friendly & helpful. Tick tock diner next door is decent enough for breakfast. There was some building work going on whilst I stayed, so there was some slight noise, but that couldnt be helped. I would recommend staying here to anybody looking to visit New York. I would most definetly stay here again.;5
Pleasant and professional reception staff. Many thanks that beautifyl, who was always very prompt in attending my requests, during my numerous stays in this hotel. Very good internet service, both by cable and wireless. Good value for the room price, comparing to similar hotels.;5
We stayed on the recently refurbished 30th floor. Couldn’t recommend the hotel more! Great location, staff & amenities. We were staying in a suite the 4 of us, not the easiest to clean, & room was left spotless everyday. The view from our room was also brill, right across from the Empire State! The history of the hotel is also fascinating, well worth going to the basement floor to read about!;5
We stayed here in Jan 2018 - this was our first trip to NY. Location of the hotel is excellent and we had a fantastic view. However the rooms are tiny - we barely had room for our suitcase. Bathroom is dated and could do with a refresh. Beds were comfortable. Hotel corridors had a very strong smell and the hotel generally could do with some modernization and a refresh.;3
I always stay at the New Yorker when in New York. A cozy hotel with a great location. The rooms were comfortable, the staff were friendly and courteous, the rates are acceptable. To me its home away from home.;5
We chose this location to be near Madison Square Garden and to have an easy walk to Broadway theaters. The view was great from the terrace off of our room. The steakhouse downstairs was great and served dinner until 10:30 PM--very helpful. There was a new bagel place across the street that was as good as any other bagel place in the City.;5
We stayed here for 5 nights. When we arrived we where asked if we would like to upgrade our room for an extra $200. We did this and arrived to a small room with a very small bathroom (which can be expected in New York anyway) and no space for a family of 5. We went back to reception, eventually the member of staff agreed to give us our original room back but we where warned it would be smaller with less of a view (we had no view in the “upgraded” room). To arrive to our original room with a much better view, 2 bathrooms and 2 separate rooms for the family of 5 to stay in. Perhaps there was a mix up with the rooms, However when this was settled we had a lovely stay rooms where kept clean and towels changed for us when needed, the staff located around the hotel where all friendly;3
This hotel is one block from MSG and is ideal for me and my wife who is in a wheelchair. We have stayed at other hotels in this area but nothing compares to the Wyndham New Yorker in terms of value, location, ease of check in, and friendly personnel.  We drive to the city from upstate and check the car in front of the hotel with minimum effort and helpful valets. We have had great experiences with room assignments the last two visits to NY.   Rooms are always very clean, well stocked with thick towels and luxury bed linens. Our room had a great view of downtown Manhattan, including views of the the Freedom tower, NY harbor and the Hudson River.  Plenty of restaurants and shopping in the area and access to the major subway lines are within one or two blocks.;5
We stayed in a standard double room and it was very clean but quite small. Not much storage space  but it was adequate for our 5 day stay.  Bathroom was small but had a great shower.  Public areas large and comfortable.  A must is the Tick Tock diner joined to the hotel, open 24 hours and the food is good. Surprised that there was a 10 dollar charge each day for Wi-Fi  but that includes visits to the business centre and the gym.;3
Great location, walking distance to Times Square and Broadway.  Great staff, very willing to make stay as comfortable as possible.  Very comfortable rooms, had a great view of the Empire States building.;5
My 3rd or 4th visit to the NY'er over last 20 years. Upgrades to rooms are delightful, proximity to public transportation is always a plus (Penn Station, subways, etc). Many sites within walking distance of the hotel. Always start our day at the Tick Tock Diner accessed thru hotel lobby.;5
Stayed at the New Yorker in June, travelling with a friend. She stays at the New Yorker periodically for work travel, so we picked this at her recommendation. I typically like smaller, boutiquey hotels, but this was a spur-of-the-moment getaway on a budget, and we did get a comparatively great price. The stay was a mixed bag of good and bad. The Good:  Super convenient location (nowhere better if you're coming for an event at MSG!)  Surrounded by relatively cheap food options (TickTock Diner was an awesome, easy choice)  Security was excellent and staff friendly  The Bad: Arrived from JFK around 5pm, and room was not yet available. That's a bit annoying, as it's 2 hours after check-in time, but not a big deal. We went out for a bit and returned to get ready for dinner, and room;4
I loved the location. Mass Transportation real close. Times Square just seven blocks away.   Now for the room...VERY disappointing. Too small. Two beds that are too big for the room. A closet that was too deep. I would say this room was bare bones. Just one painting on the walls. The television was too small. The Direct TV kept going out of service. The photos that are shown on this website are not representative of the room I stayed in.   The biggest downer was the construction across the street that was going on at all hours of the night.  There were nights I couldn’t sleep. I acknowledge that’s not the hotel’s fault, but still...  There are plenty of fast food restaurants in the area as well as a couple 7-11s and CVS. But I couldn’t find a really nice restaurant nearby. The;3
The beds were not comfortable at all. Hard as a rock and nothing fluffy or soft, not even the blankets! The photos portrayed online so. It depict the actual rooms. Maybe. Room has been remodeled but this should not be marketed if it’s not what you get.;2
The staff was very friendly and they took our room preference which we add while making the reservation to notice and they provided us a room like that. The security was also debonair. HOWEVER, the hotel itself was so outdated. There wasn’t a fridge in the room, the bed and the chair were both worn-out, the windows were so dirty that you couldn’t see outside clearly. And the room itself was really small.;4
Stayed 12 nights and spent a few days in an upgraded room with a view of chrysler, empire state and madison square.  PROS Delightful service from check-in and security staff. Fairly easy to get a free room upgrade.  A lot of ppl complain abt the resort fees but I think it’s convenient- I had made an online purchase for tickets that didn’t get through so I didn’t hesitate to make an international phone call to my credit card company. I also had to make an Amazon return, so I was able to print out the return bar code from the Business center. It eased me of the small anxieties I get when travelling.  Convenient location- can walk to most broadway shows, Chelsea market/high line, super close to Madison Square Garden which is great if you don’t want to wait too long in line at a;3
The hotel is beautiful, clean and the staff wonderful, but the noise we experienced while staying there was unbearable.  First it was the construction noise all night long, then got moved to a nicer room, but I swear we were in the elevator shaft as we heard (and felt) the elevators rising/falling all day/night. Other than that, the place is great!;3
Arrived with my daughter for her 21st birthday treat. Checked in by a lovely guy Mohammed who was friendly and couldn’t do enough for us. He gave my daughter a nice bottle of wine to celebrate her birthday which was a lovely touch. I’m writing this on our first morning having a coffee in our upper floor queen suite which is clean and comfortable and has jaw dropping views of the city (Empire state, Chrysler building etc). Arrived quite late last night so had a snack and cocktails in the hotels Italian trattoria which was lovely and a relaxed vibe. Great midtown location and lovely Art Deco touches. Staff all very friendly and helpful and Mohammed gave a great first impression for the first time visitor. Highly recommended!!;5
The hotel was built in Art Deco style and this continues into the rooms, although there had clearly been some renovation in our room as the shower and bath were new but the hand basin and fittings appeared original. There is a display of photographs in the basement of how it once was. It is in close proximity to many sights and places of interest in downtown New York. Our room was clean, comfortable and quiet (reception made sure we were placed away from the building noise) and we got a good night's sleep. Room facilities included an iron and ironing board as well as a television, alarm clock with power sockets, and a good Wifi connection. Breakfast is served in the Tick Tock diner which is within the hotel property. If staying at the hotel pick-up discount vouchers for;4
We booked the biggest suite they had and thought there was a mistake when we walked in. It was an incredibly small room. Incredibly small bathroom- literally only 1 person could stand in there at once. The “doorman” outside helped us into an Uber once out of the many times we left the hotel to go somewhere. Overall disappointed with the service and the size.;2
Brilliant hotel, staff are all good. Request something and they try to help. Old but brilliant. Some Rooms are small but hey not an issue. We had 2 rooms start of holiday and a special 1 at the end when we returned wow.  Only thing jack hammer on building opposite going all night but its part of the new york experience. Oldy world hotel cant knock it. Thank you to everyone who made it a special holiday;5
Well when we walked into reception it is beautiful looking. Everyone, well nearly, were friendly. We got called to a separate desk to check in. He said it was too early. We knew this anyway but wanted to leave our cases to wander. Didn't get the man's name but he was quite rude. I said have we got a view, I'm excited about this holiday. He said we'll obviously not because you didn't pay for one. I was tired couldn't be bothered to argue. Came back to reception later, forgot the lady's name, but she was lovely. She said she had given us a nice room on the 8th floor. I sound ungrateful but I would of liked a high floor. View of empire state, but through a very dirty window. Slightly disappointed. Didn't want to feel like this on my special birthday. Unpacked. Very comfy bed and;3
This is a big old hotel in mid manhattan close to everything. You have walking distance to all major tourist attractions on manhattan. Super close to the subwaystation and madison square garden. We stayed here for a week and it is an old but well managed hotel. Everything is made in old style. The beds are good and the room is clean. We got a magnificent view over Empire state building from our room. Tv with a lot of channels. Beware of the accomodation fee for wifi ang gym.;4
"Someone told us when we said we were staying at The New Yorker that it was ""old."" We actually found it to be ""period."" An Art Deco original, the hotel suite in which we stayed was roomy and had an outdoor patio with a scrumptious view (and the weather was perfect!). There was a metal table and chairs on the patio, which we used to enjoy the night view. There were two modern TVs & a fridge and a state of the art Keurig. A/C had a separate control for bedroom and living room in the suite. The Art Deco furniture had modern features (soft close drawers, overstuffed couch). The king mattress was comfortable. There were two bathrooms, where I had the only issue. There is a narrow ledge over the sink on which to put toothbrush, etc., and there really wasn't enough room, but since there";5
Great location close to everything just a short walk to times square.  Had a wonderful view. Security was good always asked to see our key card before allowing anyone on the elevators. Great to have a 24 hour restraunt onsite.;4
Helpful staff from the beginning to end.  Room had all you need, was clean and modern, although not particularly large.  Coffee making facilities etc.  In ideal location for us as we had just arrived by Amtrak and the hotel was a 5 minute walk from the station.  Would definitely go there again when in NY.;4
We went to the U2 concert at MSG, just a 1 minute walk away. And that is the main strength of this hotel: the location. Nearly everything is in walking distance! We walked to shows on Broadway, to restaurants and to many stores for some shopping.  The room on the 8th floor was very small (nearly European style) and the bathroom was really too small (cruise ship size). Also because it is an old hotel, the windows are not sealed, so all the noice from the streets comes in at night (some awful drilling going on the last 2 nights). We stayed 4 nights and the room and bathroom were clean and neat. Nevertheless, besides the excellent location, we would not recommend this hotel.;3
I stayed with my adult daughter for 9 nights and it was a very safe choice. It was a great location and easy walk everywhere. A lovely diner and restaurant attached. Well run hotel.  Adequate room size.  Dated bathroom that worked really well is all part of the history and privilege of staying there. Loved the big revolving door!  *Close to Madison, Macy's, Intrepid, Times Square, and many other places *You need to show your lift card to enter that area *Very helpful staff *Clean, with all toiletries  *Quick taxi base *Laundry mat close;5
The hotel itself is gorgeous, the 1920’s decor is beautiful, the staff are all friendly and helpful, and some of the floors appear to be updated.... but not ours.  The 20th floor looks tired, the carpets worn, the paintwork chipped and grubby.  Our room was clean, had a comfortable bed, tv, alarm clock that you can plug your phones into. Which was just as well as I was too scared to use the sockets in the wall- all loose and felt a bit dangerous to use. The plumbing is definitely 1920’s, the shower was poor and the bathroom dated.  There was no coffee/tea making facilities, it was only on checkout I learned I could have had them for an extra charge. However, plenty of places nearby to get a coffee, including the excellent though expensive tick tick diner.  My sons were given a;3
"Stayed for a meeting and was offered a ""room with a view"" on the phone.  When I arrived the view turned out to be straight down 34th Street to the Empire State Building, so I could hardly complain.  The room itself was a bit small (not Japanese hotel small) but fully appointed with closet, desk, dresser/TV, and multiple plugs for all my devices.  The bathroom was fairly spacious and clean, although the shower was a little confusing (separate taps for tub/shower and hot/cold, so four in all), and one of the bolts on the toilet seemed to be a little bit loose.  Just minor things.  Sometimes the room was a little musty-smelling when I came back in the evening but this was easily cleared up by turning on the A/C.  The building itself is a nice 40-story art deco hotel with quite a";4
I have stayed at this hotel now for three different stays and it is perfect each time. They have three very different on site restaurants, have a person to check that you are really a guest before you get to use the elevators (very reassuring for solo travelers), extremely helpful and pleasant staff, and some wonderful views of the city. Although it can be a bit noisy considering the neighborhood, just request an upper floor and you’ll be fine-remember, I’m from rural Vermont so my definition of noisy/quiet may be a lot diferent than yours. This hotel is within one block of Madison Square Garden so after your event getting back to your hotel is hassle free! Definitely a perk! It also has a fascinating history which is curated in a small museum in the lower lobby.;5
We recently completed our fourth stay at this hotel (the second under the Wyndham banner) and it is our favorite city location. Close to the subway, Penn Station, charter bus stops (we bus up from the DC area), Broadway, and Times Square, it's location can't be beat and, by NYC standards, the price is reasonable. Great location for walking, with plenty of good restaurants nearby (which is good because you really need to skip the one in the hotel lobby).  Hotel staff is very friendly and you can not access the lobby elevators without showing your room card -- nice security touch. Bags can be stored for only $4 each and, while the drop off can take some time at checkout, pickup is generally quite fast.  We'll be back.;4
We rode the train in from Philadelphia, PA. The fact that we were able to navigate our way out of the train station right on to the 8th Avenue exit and look to our left to find our hotel was RIGHT THERE was AMAZING! We checked in at 5:30 in the evening and the front desk had informed me that the hotel was booked for the night and because of this we had been upgraded to a suite! NEVER HAPPENS TO ME... The room was clean, well lit and exactly what I was thinking it should look like based on the pictures shown. The elevator was very fast but I didn't feel any vertigo which was a plus since we were on the 26th floor. The information desk was very nice and helpful when we needed recommendations and directions. The next morning we went to the two attractions for $54 deal: the Empire;5
My wife and I stayed here on a four day trip to New York. The location was great, just a short stroll from Penn Station, which was ideal for the Subway. Also close to Madison Square Gardens. We were greeted by very friendly reception staff who presented us with a complimentary bottle of wine as it was our honeymoon (thanks Mahamood). Our room was a little small and tired however that is my only criticism. The staff were all friendly, the bed comfortable and shower excellent. This hotel is ideal for those wanting a good location and just a bed to sleep in whilst over in NEw York!;3
We stayed for 3 nights. The hotel itself was good. Staff went above and beyond to assist us with any needs we had. Location is convenient. Our BIG complaint is the drilling happening all night from construction down the street. It’s currently 4 am. The drilling has been going on since 10PM! What a horrible horrible night.   We would come back here but only when construction has finished. If you are planning on staying anytime soon please beware that you will not get any sleep. Thankfully our flight home is tomorrow and we won’t have to listen to this again. Alternatively I suggest you bring ear plugs.;2
Booked through travel agent. Will suggest they recommend somewhere else. Only recommendation for this hotel is the location, Room tatty, and too small for 3 adults. Nowhere to unpack luggage. No drinks supplied. Breakfast for a dollar offered every time we logged onto free wifi, but not honoured.;2
Great hotel in prime location very close to Macys,Madison Square garden and Penn station.Staff extremely  friendly.Spotless clean.I asked for a refrigerater and they supplied it free of charge.Fantastic stay from start to finish.Would be my first choice if I travel to New York again.This was my 5th trip to New York and the New Yorker is by far the best hotel that I've stayed in.;5
110 people from FL stayed to either perform or attend the performance of students from the Durant High School band perform at Carnegie Hall.  The location was terrific for sightseeing and subway access.  The rooms offered a variety in size and view but were all CLEAN and KEPT.  The staff were helpful and professional considering the immense amount of traffic and guests constantly in and out.  We always felt safe walking around regardless of time of day or night.;5
"This Art Deco classic is well maintained but is in need of some major up dating. Although clean, the color schemes are dated, the carpets are clean but are of a different era (or two). Function food for large crowds is passable, luke warm, ""10 seat round"" function tables are too small for 10 adults to sit and eat a full dinner. Good location close to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.";3
Came here with my new wife for part 1 of our honeymoon. Will definitely be back again.  Read alot of reviews about the state of the rooms. Now this is an old iconic building with alot of history, but the rooms are clean and the security is well manned. The location of this hotel is smack bang in the middle of everything, which to me is the mosy important aspect of being in NYC. If your holiday is defined by tiredness of the room then you're not getting out enough!  We arrived at 16:05 expecting our room to be ready as check in is 16:00, but we had a small wait. This was fine as the young gentleman on reception gave us vouchers for complimentary drinks in the bar.  Staff are very helpful in reception, but do your research if your travelling somewhere. There is a travel advisor on;5
"Wonderful building reminiscent of the heyday of the Hollywood movies of the 50's.Super location for the famous Midtown attractions which are within walking distance. Right by Penn Station for the subway to go further afield on Manhattan island, or, as in our case, Amtrak for journeying along the coast  through the beautiful scenery of New England to Boston. Our standard Queen room on the 36th was well appointed, comfortable, small, but with an expansive, breathtaking view of the grand towers of the city; a memorable sight to behold at sundown. Dining in the hotel's Italian restaurant was decent and relaxing after trekking around the vibrant NY streets. Big thanks to the extraordinarily helpful, ""can-do"", front-of-house staff: Laura at Reception, and Reachell and Mohammed, at the";5
I stayed here with my family for St Patrick's weekend. The location of the hotel is amazing, with madison square garden round the corner, Subways only a minute away, and Times Square only a 10 minute walk. We had amazing views of the city and the price was very reasonable, particularly for the location. The rooms, although small, were very clean and the bed was very comfortable. I had requested a crib for our son and it was all set up when we arrived (which has not always been the case when we boom hotels and request one!!)  The staff were friendly and very helpful, particularly the receptionists.  Highly recommend.;4
The website doesn't do this hotel justice.  My aunt was visiting from New York and I wasn't sure she would be happy.  Not only was she happy but so was I.  The staff was friendly and extremely helpful.  The rooms are spacious and the carpet was so soft.  The hallways smelled good and were bright and welcoming.  The lobby is beautiful too.  The Italian restaurant in the lobby was excellent and not over priced for such a nice restaurant. The food and service was perfect.  The location is across the street from Penn Station.  Very convenient from and too JFK, LAG, and Newark.  Pharmacy, shopping, Madison Square Garden are all within one block from the hotel.;5
This was a trouble business trip with excellent accommodations. The check-in was smooth, and the check-in even smoother. Nice clean room. The bathroom layout was a little annoying, as the toilet was located in a tight spot, but other than that, great.;5
This hotel should be classified as a motel. They try to sell you false hope in the entry, but when you get up to the floors for the rooms they are in bad shape, dusty, paint peeling off walls, showers in poor condition, floors with dirt build up. The rooms smell of dust. Retraining for the housekeepers needs to done.   Their customer service at their front desk also needs to be improved, trying to double bill me for items I had already paid for and when I tried to explain it, I was yelled at and treated like a child and was not given an apology when they saw they made a mistake.    If you call housekeeping and no one answers don’t call the front desk, it will take them forever to answer, but on top of that they can not connect you to housekeeping or assist, I was told to call;1
Third visit to this hotel. We were In one of the old rooms which are now getting tired and needing revamped. Still it’s a nice hotel   The concierges John and Anthony are superb and bend over backwards to help;4
I visited NYC with my sister and our daughters for a fun girls’ trip.  While the room was small, it was very clean and comfy!  The hotel staff were very helpful and attentive.  The hotel is very old (1930s) so the bathroom was also small. But, suited our needs. And, the water pressure was great!!! We loved the location. Walking distance to Times Square, Macy’s, & Empire State Building.  There is a McDonald’s and Starbucks right across the street (great for breakfasts) and a CVS right next door!  We also walked to the High Line. But, when we were tired of walking, the subway entrance is just a few steps from the front door! We loved staying at The New Yorker and will do it again!;5
Good hotel to stay in, room was small but this is normal for USA.STAFF ARE FRIENDLY in the hotel. Tick tock mmmm  For the age of this hotel, it has charactor and charm. Staff are professional and very friendly. Worth every penny (cent) Thank you for making the holiday full of good memories.;5
We stayed here for 5 nights for my birthday. We had a really nice clean room on the 32nd floor although traffic noise was still an issue. I guess that’s what you have to expect from a noisy city like NYC. We had a view of Maddison Square Gdns and beyond. Toiletries were provided and a hairdryer. We didn’t turn on the tv but it was well positioned. The hotel put a bottle of sparkling wine in the room with a card wishing me a happy birthday. We found the location to be excellent as nearly everywhere was within walking distance or a short ride on the subway.;4
I stayed with husband and children. The hotel was beautiful, clean and safe. The hotel room was more then we expected. The bathroom was the only area we had hoped would be more spacious. But overall worth the money and the location was very convenient to the city;5
Location is a win! Around the corner to Penn Station Access. Front desk workers could be friendlier and welcoming. Walls are very thin. Could hear doors closing and conversations of people in the hall ways. I would assume if I can hear them they can hear me.  Need ventilation in bathroom. When finished with hot bath the walls and ceiling would be dripping water.;3
We enjoyed the amazing view, employees were execellent, everything was extremely clean. The location accomidated our business needs, we were on the 38th floor and appreciated the security. We will stay again, as we were very happy with our stay.;5
Pretty nice hotel with interesting history. Tick took diner was a fun, convenient place to eat with delicious food.  Location is central in Manhattan. Our air conditioning wasn’t working when we checked in but when we called it was fixed quickly.;4
10 days stay was comfortable and enjoyable. Rooms were good, most staff were nice. Room maid was nice and left a note and an origami as a reply to our small tip. Room offers good views and very accessible to many places compared to other hotels. Definitely recommended!;5
Expedia messed our reservation up and put us here instead of our original hotel.  I was concerned at first, but the hotel seemed really nice.  The check-in went very smoothly and the clerk gave us some breakfast tickets because of my son's 18th birthday.  When we got to the room, it was nice.  Small, but nice enough.  Our room had a great view of the Empire State building.  It was nice to work on my computer while looking at the view!  One night while in the bathroom, I had to kill a roach.  I didn't worry too much about it until my wife killed another one the next evening.  Maybe that's normal for NYC, but I don't like it!    The internet was actually pretty good.  Better than a lot of other places that I have stayed! The mattress wasn't the best, but sleepable.  The restaurant;3
Just returned yesterday and loved our stay in New York, only downside was the size of the room, it was tiny and could hardly move. Not even enough space to open our suitcases to unpack. Had asked for a bigger room with a view as we were staying for our anniversary but didn’t get it so no view just looking into hotel windows so had to keep curtains closed. Bed was uncomfortable with a big dip in the middle which we rolled into but room was clean. Although it’s an old hotel with some beautiful original Art Deco features it needs a paint in the hallways as it dark and dingy. Location was ideal though. Security at lifts were friendly and polite, reception staff miserable. $2 per bag storage after checking out was great and the guy was lovely. Would come again but only if I was;4
This was my first time in New York. The hotel was brilliantly place to see and do everything a first time tourist would wish to do. Staff very friendly shame about the charge for room smoking even if you don’t smoke. I arrived at the hotel late in the evening with not money only a travel card as I don’t carry credit cards or other cards abroad in case of a lose. I was then half way through check in and had to roam the streets at night to find and atm so I could collect the required cash to be let up to my room to cover smoking fines even though I do not smoke. This been said I was give an upgrade as it had been noticed by staff my trip was going to include my birthday. Christmas which is when I went is the most spectacular thing to ever see in such an iconic city. The room and;5
The Newyorker may have seen better days in the past, today it is a tourist trap where tour groups arrive by the busload. Almost no business travelers and no frequent visitors. Reality is far from what you see on the website.   Two women at the rewards desk (just before check in) were making fun of a guest as soon as he left the counter, because he was overly polite and spoke spoke with an east asian accent.   Website says breakfast at TicToc diner included and then the fine print reveals that only on weekends, on weekdays you go up to the Sky lounge which is a dull, empty room with a few tables and chairs where the pastries, breads, fruits weren't refreshed throughout my week long stay.   I have stayed at several other hotels in the vicinity as I travel to NYC  few times every;1
Stayed here for 4 nights with my sister in law for her first visit to NYC. Disappointed is an understatement. We had been told the hotel had been upgraded but the hotel looked tired in most places.  Our room was tiny!!!  and on the side of the street where construction drilling continued throughout the night! 🙈 staff didn’t seem to care about this. The beds were comfortable once we eventually got to sleep!  John on concierge was really helpful but the other staff I didn’t find at all helpful.  The redeeming feature was the tick tock diner attached to the hotel who served great food and the staff were really attentive.  The hotel is centrally located within a short walking distance of times sq etc so a good spot in terms of location but the hotel is definitely in need of some;2
The New Yorker is a good hotel and is perfectly placed for exploring NY. The good points are staff very helpful and knowledgeable, the Italian restaurant was also good as was the Tic Tock diner and as I have said it’s a perfect location to explore all the major attractions on foot and transport links are also very conveniently to hotel. I would have given the hotel 4* but I think it could do will a touch up in most areas except the lobby. I know it’s an old beautiful  Art Deco building but I still believe it could keep all its decor but should be freshened up .;3
Great location, security, and professional staff. Need to drop your bags, this is place if you're a guest whether checking in or out. It's free at check in and $2/bag at check out. It's a stone's throw from Penn Station and easy access to almost anywhere in the city.;4
Great restaurants, teeny room, no view, excellent mattress, great location - this historic (old) hotel needs a renovation so this is a mixed review.  No 2 rooms are alike, many don't have a coffee maker.  It seemed clean & our chamber maids were attentive to our needs.  The location & hotel restaurants make this worth consideration.;3
Walking into to the hotel we thought we had booked a 5 star hotel instead of a 3 star.  Check in was very easy.  We got to our room - so disappointed in it - very poky room for 3 ladies - only 2 beds.  We didn't mind sharing the bed but we had asked for a triple room.  Breakfast was served next door in a diner but it was excellent and we were served by the same host every morning - he was brilliant.  - would recommend the hotel but if booking a triple room make sure it is a large room.;3
The hotel is very well located for visiting all of New Yorks attractions. Turn right out of hotel, walk 20 yards and your perfect view of Empire State! Stayed for 6 nights June 18 and the spice was first class from check in to check out. Did not use facilities as too busy sightseeing. Rated 3 due to rooms. Ours and other couple with, were a little tired. Tried to get a refurb room but this would be a 20 dollar upgrade and none available until midway thru stay. In truth, don't bother unless you are going to stay in your rooms a lot. You sleep and wash in the room. The bar was nice the gym looked fine albeit didn't use it! When walking 12 - 18 miles a day you don't need a gym! We walked everywhere so didn't use Penn Station which is only 75 yards away. Times Square approx 5-10 min;4
Was very disappoint paid for 4 star got a room not big enough to swing a cat I had been to new York before and was expecting nicer Acomadation the tick tick restraunt was over rated and service slow food was not great would have been happy if I paid for a two star breakfast was included it's not a choice it a quosant and pice of fruit witch you often don't get;2
Loved this hotel great location lots of original art deco features. Rooms were small but totally fit for purpose bed was very comfy shower was hot and good water power.Security was good and staff were very helpful is in a perfect position to use Penn station a short walk to times square EPS Macys this was my first trip to NYC and this hotel was exactly what i wanted my very own miracle on 34th street;5
This hotel is at a brilliant location. It's walking distance to nearly everything. If not catch the subway. Was given a rubbish room on 24th floor couldn't swing a guinee pig in. But was able to change it to a room where you could just about swing a cat on the 33rd floor. Would stay here again.;4
Nice hotel clean historic this hotel has a museum downstairs unbelievable the people that stayed there throughout the years the staff very friendly very kind very informative you're right across the street from Madison Square Garden the subway station is right there you can travel anywhere you'd like in New York City from that location I find a location to be very safe even doing the late evening hours;5
excellent location, clean room. helpful hotel staff. BUT hotel's Tick Tock coffee shop is a disaster because there aren't nearly enough wait staff to handle the job. So orders get screwed up and no one is available to fix the problems.;4
This hotel is phenomenal. I returned for a second stay after a great first experience. Location is excellent, the staff are fantastic, and the rooms are great. I will be back again! Miguel is one of the best employees I have ever dealt with.;5
Beautiful hotel. Gorgeous helpful friendly staff. Got an upgrade to a higher floor on arrival. Had amazing views of the city. Great breakfast on site. Handy location for all the attractions. Will be back!;5
Stayed at the New Yorker for 2 nights on quick visit trip to see 2 shows and give my daughter a taste of new York. We arrived at Penn station and left by Penn station, so having that right next door was perfect. The hotel is beautiful, and the room was perfect for us. It was very convenient to have the tick tock cafe right there for breakfast in the mornings. It is in walking g distance to times square, and easy access to metro. Pricey but it is new york!;4
We were celebrating our 45th wedding anniversary and they gave us a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate. The New Yorker/Wyndham staff were so professional. Upon returning to New York, we will stay at NY/Wyndham and the location is the greatest. We were on the 30th floor, the view was like a postcard and the night view for taking pictures couldn't have been better.;5
Great location in central Manhattan, walking distance to many sights and easy access to metro, Time Square, Broadway, Empire State, Macy's etc. Our room was very tired and lacked space. Shower was adequate but not up to expected standards of today's hotels. Tick Tock diner was good for a meal or breakfast.;3
As you know I 'd written a nice report about this hotel but now everything change to bad Their create my reservation 4 times and after 10 days I couldn't have my money back and I'm unable to use my credit card..they agree about their mistake but I Already spike with 4 person , guest managers but I'm still waiting for their reply.  I think it will be my last time here... Elevator doesn't work very well and 2 days ago we must use service elevator after 15 minutes waiting for... Really bad time at The New Yorker;1
"The New Yorker turned out to be a pleasant surprise for my wife and I, who recently spent a week in New York.  The location was really key: right next to Penn Station (so you are very close to subway lines) as well as Madison Square Garden, and within walking distance of A LOT.  Obviously, when staying in New York, I'm not expecting to open my hotel door for the first time and see thousands of square feet of room space, but there was more than adequate room (I have stayed at places in NY where you couldn't close the bathroom door if you were ""utilizing the commode"").  The room, hallways, common areas, etc. were always clean.  Even being an older hotel, you could tell that upgrades have been made to keep up with technology and the times.    There are multiple restaurants on the";5
I stayed here for 5 nights with my sister. Very impressed with the service and the room overall. Excellent WiFi in the rooms which is included. We had a view of the Empire State Building from our room which was brilliant.   If you are expecting 5* then this place isn’t for you as the rooms could do with a lick of paint however the rooms are comfortable and the beds are good. Everything is clean and the maids come in daily to change sheets and towels. The bath and shower could be better. The television picture was fuzzy. The lift could also do with modernising.   Overall for the price I would stay here again and the service overall was lovely.;4
The Art Deco style of the hotel is very cool, we wanted somewhere memorable and we got it!  We got a room looking out over the Empire State Building on Floor 31 and the rooms - for New York - are pretty spacious and clean. The bed was so comfortable, we slept like babies every night. And the air con came in handy as it was 32*C!  The location is fantastic, conveniently near Penn Station, down the road from Times Sq and Broadway, next to Madison Sq Gdn, near the High Line, everywhere worth seeing is accessible easily.  Special thanks to Mohammad who went the extra mile for us as we were celebrating a special occasion, and also to Mark who organised a late check-out for us as we had a late flight home. In fact everyone at hotel was unbelievably friendly and helpful. All in all, I;5
The location is great, next to Penn station so excellent access to transportation links. However, this was probably the only good thing about the hotel.  Check in was slow (staff on reception even ignoring the queue at times to allow others to jump the queue). Our room was clean but very tired and in desperate need of an upgrade.  The walls were very thin: we could hear the showering running, the toilet flushing and people using hairdryers at all hours.  In addition, we'd emailed the hotel two days prior to our arrival to make a request, they were unable to help us with the request (that's fine) but it took them 4 days to reply to us - not really acceptable. There are many better hotels in the surrounding area at a similar price and we won't be staying here again.;2
My friend and I have been staying at the New Yorker hotel for our annual meet up in the city. We tried another hotel one year and swore e would NEVER DO THAT AGAIN. The New Yorker Hotel is a great place, great rooms, great location right in the city, near Penn Station and one of the perks is having THE TICK TICK DINER attached right at the lobby for some great breakfasts.;5
"We are currently enjoying a 4 night stay here and just wanted to write an early review before we forget a couple of names that need an extra thanks.  The hotel is ideally situated to spend each day choosing a different direction and spending your days walking around seeing all that Manhattan has to offer (our feet are aching from the miles covered!)  On first arriving Mohammad was an absolute delight booking us in, friendly and welcoming and surprising us for our Honeymoon with a room high up looking over Empire State, Chrysler and Madison Sq Gardens. Couldn’t have asked for better.  The rooms are small, but this is New York and everywhere squeezes in as much as possible; But let’s face it, how much space do you need when your only crawling into the room to sleep exhausted after";5
"Great location; check out Liberty Bagels - Delicious; lots of places to see nearby; close to subway and bus services; busy area, but exciting; put on your walking shoes and ENJOY yourself in NYC - YEAH";4
Small rooms . Old old old building with rooms not very modern at all. Only redeeming factor was that it was very close to Madison square garden which I was attending a concert also room was clean as well.;2
Stayed back in 2014 after a cruise and it's a nice hotel. Rooms were a little dated back in 2014 so may be different now. We were on a high floor so gave good views over the city.   Not a good location for Time's Square, a nice walk down though.;4
"I rarely right a review but sometimes I feel I have to. Right across the hotel on 8th St., every night from 9pm to 4am there's a jack hammer working!!   Add this to breakfast being ONLY ""a cup of coffee and a muffin"", and outdated bath you get the idea.";1
the room we booked was great! i believe it was a mobility double suite, very spacious which was something i was worried about based on other reviews, but we had more than enough space (3 of us total)  for everyone's stuff and to sleep comfortably. the sofa pull-out bed was even comfy too! maid service was friendly and so were the guys who were at the front desk when we checked in, i wish i could remember their names now. We checked in late due to flight delays and i was worried we'd lose the reservation or be charged a late fee, but they checked us in without any problem!  there were a couple of fruit flies in the bathroom, i guess coming through the drain, but not many and really we didn't care too much about it. location was great! especially for taking the subway since an;5
Very busy checking in but efficiently done when it was our turn. Our room was fairly small but adequate (we were only staying for 4 nights and obviously we were sightseeing.  Comfortable and clean beds. Our room had a limited view (on the 33rd floor). Only drawback was there's no kettle/drinks facilities so we took bottles of orange juice for the morning.  Very good choice of breakfast which was served in the adjoining (all day) diner.  All in all goid value.;4
Very good  and reasonably priced for a short stay. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Thw  shower temp.  and water pressure was terrific. Convenient to restaurants and transportation. Wished there was a mini refrigerator in the room to store a cold drink.;4
lovely stay at this very central hotel, rooms were a tiny bit tired but so spotlessly clean, but more so than a 5* hotel we stayed in off 5th Ave last year. Staff helpful, location perfect. Thank you New Yorker;5
I've seen a few poor reviews, and I'm confused as to what could have actually gone wrong.  I came in late, and my check-in was perfect!  I tried to get his name (Drees, Dris IDK), but I didn't see him again during my stay.  I am a Diamond member, got an upgrade when I checked in...and it was definitely the best room I have ever had in NYC.    Hotel is close to everything...yet important to me, not in the middle of everything, so you can still move around and breathe.  $8 in a cab virtually takes you anywhere you don't feel like walking.  I didn't notice any noise or construction, I had a balcony, and slept with the door open both nights because the weather was so amazing!;5
Room was small not use to the New York style rooms, but all in all nice hotel close to Times Square and shopping areas. Staff was very nice, two restaurants right in the hotel for convenience, and McDonald right across the street from the hotel.;4
Easy check in and we were upgraded to another room.  Rooms are very small and only one chair to sit in with very little room.  When you entered one had to stand to the left for the other person to get it as the bed was in the way.  The bathroom was so tiny there was hardly enough room to dry yourself off.  On the upside the rooms were clean and the bed comfortable. Unfortunately our room did not have much of a view, but we were in a safe area an close to shops and Penn station.  It was noisy but most rooms in New York int his area are noisy as there is so much going on.  The staff were very friendly, just a shame the rooms were so small, but I have been told this is with most rooms in NY.  They charged us extra on our credit card and they have not yet got back to me.;4
"We stayed here for a couple of nights in the city before embarking on a cruise. We checked in around noon and were promised a call when our room was ready. After dropping our bags with bell services, we hit the city for some lunch and light sightseeing until our room was ready. As we had been traveling since 4:00AM, we were pretty tired and were ready for a little rest.  We returned to the hotel at 3:00PM (""official"" check-in time) having not heard anything about our room being ready yet. Sure enough, it was not. The guest services representative said it would likely be another hour, as the previous guest had just checked out. Too tired to do any more sightseeing, we relaxed in the lobby until 4:00PM. The room was still not ready, but the representative said they would find out";3
"Allocated room 3019 for a five night stay, this was an upgrade to a ""view"" up 34th Street towards the Empire State Building.  Booking in was simple and quick, I had managed to arrange an upgrade before arriving, the room was fine but not as palatial as room 2607 on my last visit, but then it was not as expensive.  Took several meals in the Tick Tock restaurant, all fine but not out of this world. Also had a meal in the Italian Restaurant, very nice meal.   Made full use of the Facility Fee with calls back to the UK, both landline and mobile numbers.  Everything was great APART from the building work opposite the front of the hotel which went on into the early hours of the morning. Pheumatic drills were being used up to 3am. The reception staff were uninterested with the comment,";3
Stayed here as part of our honeymoon. Staff on check in were not friendly and did not give us any information about the hotel. Stayed on the 25th floor. Room was extremely small and basic. Bed, tv and wardrobe. Would have liked water or kettle or even fridge. Bathroom was also very small, shower was poor and there was no fan. Room was very small and looked onto an office building. Had to que for lifts each day. Security in place in the building so felt very safe.  Maybe standard for New York but did find it disappointing and would not recommend for any honeymoon couples.;2
We stayed here before it became a Wyndham hotel so it wasn’t as cool looking as it is now. The room was really small so much so that only one person could walk around the bed at a time. We didn’t spend much time in the room for it to us bother us. The bed was ok and the shower grand. The diner on the corner was one of the best breakfast experiences I’ve had in New York.;3
This was my second stay in this hotel, 1st one was about 9 years ago in a tiny room with no view, this time there were 4 of us, 2 13yr old boys who cannot share a bed due to dangly limbs and myself and my other half. We decided on a suite as on of the boys could have the pull out sofa. We arrived a little early for check in (about 30 mins) and were advised to try again in an hour, we came back in 2, still not ready, very apologetic and gave us vouchers for breakfast the next day. We took this opportunity to see if the queues were bad in the Empire State Building and went there (no queue) came back to find the room ready. Nice big living area and 2 small double beds in a separate room. We let the boys have them as the pull out bed was bigger and suited us better. We slept really;4
I was ignored since Tuesday night about my missing nightgown This hotel forgot how to treat a CUSTOMER. I will ensure I never EVER spend a cent in this hotel and also at any Wyndham hotel chain ever again.  And it is not because of MY nightgown missing from the room I PAID for, but for the lack of accountability from ALL the parties from this hotel that were involved.;1
09-13june2018 Room 23xx Check-in process takes yearsssss Room is incredibly super small for group of 4. Wall is too thin, we can hear next room activities and chat, especially the toilet noise.  Our bed is just next to their toilet/bathroom.  See some homeless people around hotel area, feeling in-secure, especially family with young kids.   WILL NEVER STAY IN THIS HOTEL AGAIN!;1
Very nice conveniently located hotel minutes from everything. Having a 2 bed room was pretty decent in size when it comes to New York standards . Would definitely stay here  again . Stayed here because of a great offer thru a time share presentation. But checking regular fares the rates were still pretty affordable.;5
Stayed here for 4 nights for my best friends 50th birthday 8 of us. Perfect location so central to everything,the hotel staff are so friendly spoiled us from the moment we checked in rooms are lovely and clean and we were upgraded to a room with 2 bathrooms!!!!!! The hotel is so lovely art deco like stepping onto a filmset would highly recommend staying here.Will definitely stay here again. ask for a coffee maker too as the coffee they supply is lovely and a great way to start your day;5
Back in his Air Force days, Ben once stayed at the New Yorker when it was a Hilton property.  Many a torrent has gone over the dam since then, and the hotel has had its ups and downs.  It was even closed entirely for a spell, but is now back.  Obviously there have been many changes, but Ben was delighted to see that the basic splendor is still apparent.  Our stay was not entirely without glitches and snags, but we were on balance very happy there. Our room was one located in the recess over the marquis visible from the street, and was quite small.  For example, the folding luggage rack located in the coat closet was essentially useless as there was no space in the room for it, upon removal from its niche in the closet.  The sad little shelf for toiletries, razor, etc. in the;4
They waived some fees for being a diamond member and also gave us some souvenirs. Unfortunately we didn't meet the points back requirement. We loved to stay there it might be better if they'd have a small fridge in the room.;5
The hotel lobby area looks amazing. Check in was a slow process, only 2 people in the line ahead of use but still took 20 minutes to get to speak to someone. When we did check in the staff were pleasant but not overly friendly.   Downsides: The room was very small, I banged my knee many times on the radiator whilst walking round to my side of the bed. The room we had was a little tired (but always clean) it was not one of the refurbished ones but despite these things I still liked it. 3 drawers and a very small closet (which we couldnt use as the safe took up to much room) The bathroom lacked storage space so toiletries remained in the bags.   The lifts were always quick, so no issues waiting around.   Reading the above you might think this isn’t a nice hotel but I really;4
Stayed here for five nights while on girls trip to NYC.Perfect location, just down the street from Empire state building and Macy's.Great 24 hr diner in the hotel, serving great food and cocktails. Hotel staff were very friendly. Rooms a little small but very clean and suitable. Right across from Madison square garden. Subway and bus stops right beside the hotel so really a great hotel location for everything. Only four subway stops from Yankee Stadium.;4
Wow, I haven't felt this controversial in a while...it seemed whenever there was a pro, there was also a con to outweigh it.  I would have given three and a half points if I could have, but settled for the lesser score. It's always nicer to be positively surprised than negatively. Since it is a huge hotel, it was not surprising that there were tons of people checking in at the same time I wanted to. Fair point. However, the check-in also felt like a mass-market procedure and I didn't feel welcomed at all. The room wasn't ready until 4pm. which was an additional challenge after an 8h flight. I just wanted a shower and lie down for a bit, but that wasn't possible.  The room was big enough, so I was very pleased with that. I even had a little balcony! The shower however turned out;3
Tick Tock dinner staff were very pushy just interested in getting their tips even asking telling you to tip  20% ate in there twice had enough so found another dinner a block away staff there nice not pushy much better food there than at the tick tock room in hotel small;3
"This hotel may appear sharp when you enter, but the hallway sure make you understand that this is not an modern hotel. It’s very old, and need refurbishment. Especially the bathroom which is very small with no storage.    In advance for our visit I kindly asked for one of the new refurbished rooms, with I read here, was actually existing. The answer I got was that they couldn’t promise anything but would put down my request. At the check in I asked if we got one of the refurbished rooms. The person I spoke with said; oh yes you definitely got an upgrade. Well that wasn’t true, so why lie about it?   The location is good if you want to live in the concrete jungle of Manhattan! The elevator was not late despite many floors.";2
Art deco style well-maintained and food/drink options are also good.  Room was small and somewhat outdated, but the location is great and within walking distance of many attractions.  Staff is accommodating and professional.;4
The hotel looks good from the outside and the lobby is imposing and grand. The room (we were told we had a newly refurbished one) was fine, very spacious, clean and had all the amenities you’d need. The shower was crazy, it flooded the bathroom and was such a direct powerful stream it was painful on your skin. The physical location of the hotel is really convenient for exploring however after many trips to New York I have never seen such horrendous levels of homelessness and so much litter, I certainly wouldn’t have ventured out of the hotel alone.;3
The hotel staff is absolutely wonderful and so accommodating.  Our flight was rescheduled and we arrived extremely early. We went directly to the hotel to check-in and they allowed us to leave our bags, complimentary, until our room was ready for check-in. They very PROMPTLY notified us when the room was ready with a phone call.  We were able to check in before 4pm.    They likewise offered to hold our bags after check-out for a cost of $2.00 per bag so we could peruse the city sans the luggage.     Our room was small, even for NYC standards.  This is not a modern hotel so if that’s what you’re looking for you will not find it here. If you don’t mind staying in a smaller, vintage room then it’s acceptable. I will warn you, however, that shower packs a punch. The water pressure;5
The hotel itself is in a fantastic location for everything to need to in New York. Especially if you are planning to see all those sights ( Empire State, Maddison SQ GDN, etc etc )  It was very clean but just needs somes TLC in places;4
This busy hotel is ideally situated across from Penn Station. The rooms and the bathrooms are clean and, although a bit dated, they are  reasonably well kept. The corridors however, could do with a bit of refurbishment. The Tick Tock Diner on the ground floor provides a good breakfast, though the staff are somewhat impatient with the hotel guests and their breakfast vouchers.;4
After a long day in NY, we got a warm welcome by Mohammed. He was very courteous & accommodating. He gave I & my wife a room a great view for my Honey moon. He always has  listening ear when Called.  The hotel is amazingly neat & organized than the hotels I have stayed in recently in NY.;4
Arrived on Saturday for an overnight stay with a friend. Miguel checked us in and was as accommodating as usual. I was upgraded to a suite (Thank you to Samira for your gracious hospitality!) so that my friend and I each had a separate bed. I was so happy to receive this surprise at check in! The bed was very comfortable, the shower had power, and very quiet during the night! We parked a car a the garage conveniently located across the street and paid $40 due to our staying at the hotel. That was quite a bonus as NYC goes! Dmitri at the Trattoria and Tick Tock room delivery speed were the icing on the New Yorker cake- It's great to have the convenience of both on site!;5
We stayed here 4 days and were very happy with our choice.   Our room was small but we expected that since we were in New York.  The beds were very comfortable. Air conditioning was great.  None of us liked the bathtub water faucets as they were probably the originals and hard to turn.  The bathroom was tiny but functional.  There is no fan in the bathroom so it got really foggy every time we took shower. The location is excellent.  Everything is near by.  It is a 6 blocks walk to Time Square but that is nothing in New York as the walk is fun.  This location is 1 block away from Macy's, H&M, may big stores so my kids were very happy.  The Korean town is only 2 blocks away so we were able to try out Korean food.  A CVS with grocery, Starbuck and McDonald are right across the;5
Awesome location to stay if looking to enjoy NYC. It's right on top of Penn station so anything you could need is right there. The hotel also features 3 restaurants so good choices are hard to make. The hotel will hold your baggage when you check out for a small fee so you can enjoy your last day without the luggage.;5
Stayed here in 2016 but did not have a tripadvisor account yet so decided to leave a review now. Hotel staff are amazing, nothing is too much trouble! They have different kind of rooms, my boyfriend and I were in one of the older ones and his parents room was renovated, so modern! To be honest I think for what you pay they all should be renovated but we were not too bothered as we were all day out anyway. The location couldn’t be better, so close to times square and madison square where you can get the subway to go everywhere!  We will go back to new york 100% just not sure if I would pay 1700€ again for 6 nights (room only) to stay in this hotel.;4
A busy but great place to stay. Very friendly staff and great central location  Decor beyond the lobby is a little tired looking but don't be put off because my room at least, was fine. A very good stay all round but desperately need towel dryers in the bathroom.;4
Fantastic experience. With what great service that I got, I thought that I was a millionaire for a couple of days. They have a designated check in desk for Wyndham Rewards members.  I was dumbfounded by the room that I got on the very top floor (40th). The room was actually a two room suite. I had a great view of the Empire State Building and the East side of Manhattan. I had no complaints. Everything was in great condition and working order. The bed was so comfortable that I was able to get some much needed rest. I didn't take advantage of any of the restaurants but the Tick Tock Restaurant looked interesting.;5
The hotel is in a good position and close to Times Square. However, rooms are old, crumbling and small. Cleaning can definitely be improved, especially the toilet. Noises until late at night coming from the street and nearby rooms due to impolite guests. Quite friendly staff.;2
When we arrived, we checked in with a pleasant staff, and she told us about the refundable deposit fee that they needed our credit card for. About $40 per night deposit, however you get it back at the time of check-in. Which was fine. We arrived to our room to find that even though we booked a queen we received a full size bed. The room was so small that there was maybe a foot between one side of the bed and the wall, and a foot between the chair of the tiny sized desk and the other side of the bed. There was a TV mounted on the wall at the foot of the bed that you had to duck under to walk around the bed. The bathroom was so tiny, if you sat on the toilet your legs blocked the door, and one shoulder touched the wall while the other touched the sink. There was no storage in;2
Initial appearance was good, lobby was busy, plush and the presence of aircrew indicated the hotel is used as stopover accommodation for major airlines.  However stepping out of the elevator the decor in corridors and rooms appeared tired and in need of renovation. Also rooms are very small. Service from housekeeping was mediocre and the doormen were not interested in assisting wheelchair clients in & out of the hotel. The only positive is the hotels location on the junction of 34th St with 8th Ave , an easy walk to Empire State, Macy's, The Highline park & Madisson Square Garden.;3
in reviews of other hotels I have to divide the review Into the property itself and the personnel.  The room I stayed in was super. I was upgraded to a suite on the 38th floor with a commanding you of Manhattan to the West, the Hudson and New Jersey. The room was in excellent condition and had apparently been recently refurbished. A couple of minor points:  it would have been good to have lamps on both sides of the bed and to have some lawn furniture on the great balcony outside of the room.  However, with one exception, all of my interactions with a hotel staff where negative. It is hard to believe that all of the people I dealt with woke up on the wrong  side of the bed. Training is essential.   I needed some help with my luggage but the Bellman by the front door simply;3
This hotel is fantastic and full of history. Rooms were a little small however as we were only sleeping there everything was first class. The hotel was central for everything we wanted to do. I would recommend the hotel to all family and friends.;5
When I got to new york I felt this is the place for me and so it was. We got into our hotel packed out our stuff and left the hotel. We found a m@m shop I was blasted with experiment. I loved it there!;5
Just stayed in the perfect hotel in the perfect location in New York City... 1930’s retro style 250 yards from Maddison square gardens, a few blocks from the Empire State Building and 20 minutes walking distance from time square and broadway...the hotel has a great diner and is very security minded (you can’t even get to the lifts without showing your room key) and your stay comes with wi-fi and a fitness room... the view from our room on the 37th floor was spectacular and the staff couldn’t be more helpful.... I can’t praise this hotel enough!;5
In the midst of times square, empire state and Broadway. At Penn St. Metro which had easy connections to jfk, central park, Greenwich village and brooklyn. Free WiFi! Staff were excellent. Room was clean and comfortable. On site diner is open 24/7 perfect for late/early flights.;4
Our plans were to go to a Island for our 35th wedding anniversary on may 22nd but due to family health issues we were not able to travel too far from home. So We decided to still  spend a night on a Island but the Island of Manhattan.We chose to stay at the New Yorker.  We have stayed here in the past and it has always been a enjoyable experience. This time it was a exceptional enjoyable experience!!!  Upon hearing it was our 35th !. Mohammed at the concierge desk  made our stay and anniversary extra special. He presented us with a nice bag filled with treats and had a bottle of wine delivered to our room. He also upgraded us to a beautiful suite with breathtaking views of the Empire State building from the balcony. Yes the balcony!!! We can not thank him enough for making our;5
We stayed at the New Yorker as part of a Road Scholar trip.  The location was perfect and made our trip so easy.  Multiple subway lines within a block of the hotel, walking distance to Times Square, the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden and Penn Station.    The staff was always polite and professional.  The room was clean and comfortable.   My only (slight) negative is that I wish the bathroom had a bit more counter space.;5
We had room 2101 the reason I mention this room is because while you hear the winding sound of the elevator I rarely.spent time in the room.as.the hotel.is.wihin easy walking distance to the tourist spots. BUT our hotel room has 2 beds. 2 closets and 2 Bathrooms. Unheard of in NYC.  It came with breakfast but I recommend that as a pass as tick tock is less than desirable.  Hotel was clean. Staff was friendly and even though the hotel has over 1000 rooms the staff each day recognized us.;3
Book in & Concierge staff were terrible. Offhand, unhelpful & rude. They should all apply for a job at Starbucks - would fit in well there. As we didn’t want to book in to an organised tour - they didn’t want to know us when we enquired about main New York attractions.Asked a guy at one end of the concierge desk for a map. He said he had run out of them & sent me to cue up with many other guests at the other end of the desk - he couldn’t be bothered moving 3 metres to get me the map. Don’t use this hotel.;1
stayed in january , excellent location , great base for getting about. room was ok , but had to ask for another bed to be set up in the room as the room classed as a twin so 2 small beds was given , except there were 3 in our room.  did request a  room with a view prior to going as it was our first NY visit , and my 50th birthday, we were given a room looking into  a grotty rear courtyard. Coffee machine in room was a bonus although had to request this too. rooms clean and tidy , staff not the friendliest.;4
We stayed here overnight on 5/23 as a part of my birthday present. Upon checkin we arrived a little early (330-345ish for a 4pm checkin) to give a little cushion for parking and traveling delays but was told we couldn’t check in until 4pm. So we waited no biggie. We had a 4:30 dinner reservation so I asked if there was a restroom to use so I could at least change and freshen up so we wouldn’t be late. I was given a key for the rest room and went downstairs. While I was getting changed there was a loud knock on the door and someone was yelling security. I finished changing and opened the door to a man questioning me and told I was being watched on camera and why am I in this bathroom? I explained about our room not being ready and we traveled hours to get here I wanted to change.;3
Stayed here last week as a landing pad after the Billy Joel concert. I agree with other reviews the rooms are tiny and the prices reflect New York City. That said, it was comfortable and the convenience to MSG was well worth it. Take some time to visit downstairs and take in some of the history of the place. Overall, we had a good experience and would certainly stay there again.;4
This hotel is situated right in the heart of Ny and within walking distance to metro station and penn station. It offers pretty generously sized room (in regard to a NY standard) which could need a little update and conservation. But the views are beautiful the room was clean and offered everything you would expect to find. The staff is very friendly and the stay was overall very positiv and I would recommend it.;3
Only stay here if you work for Virgin Airlines or if location is a must.     The rooms are small and dated.  Only those with a view feel comfortable. If you have a standard room you will be disappointed as your view will be of the buildings brickwork. Some views are spectacular but others will allow you to see directly into New York apartments.  Not exactly what I want to be charged upto $300 per night for.   We arrived at 1730 (five and half hours after the prescribed checkout time) and two of the three rooms were not available.  This was all after our long flight with three elderly parents who needed to rest.  We received one complimentary breakfast each, as compensation for the delay to our rooms.  Our rooms were not ready as they had allowed incoming Virgin Airlines flight;2
This was a first stop off for us on a months trip to the US and Canada. The idea was to find somewhere in a convenient location to see all the sights in New York in just a few days. We weren't disappointed at all. The hotel is typical Art Deco in style. We transferred from Newark Airport by rail to Penn Station which is just opposite the Hotel. It was an easy transfer with our big suitcases. Reception was good we were queue jumped by a manager type, just what we needed when we were a bit tired ... He up graded us and gave us breakfast vouchers. Which was also good. Our room on the 7th floor was one that was described as being in the new bit and had been refurbished ... It was small but everything we needed and front facing. We didn't use the breakfast vouchers choosing instead;5
One of the great hotels in New York, I would stay here again . A very busy hotel morning and afternoon, the only thing is the rooms are very small. We booked a suit for 4 people, but we really should have had only 3 . Hotel is very central to all of NYC;4
Not worth it some rude front desk agents will put you in a small room with marks on the wall. I had a room with slow drain (sink) rented a fridge for 20 didn't keep my food cold had to waste food. Naiam is not helpful, rude, and a liar. Regardless of what the change may occur write it down and who you spoke with. Will not be returning also bell men are rude don't do anything to help wait and sit around to watch.;2
Stayed here on our 1st visit to New York. We found the location good for us. 10 min walk from Times Sq and Empire State Building. The hotel restaurant Tick Tock was a good place to fuel up to start the day. Good sign that it was used by locals as well as guests. Rooms are of a decent size and reasonable quality. But hey you don't go to New York to stay in your room. We would stay here again.;4
Just great! I searched for a long time in hotels and finally chose this hotel! We stayed there for a long time and the service was excellent, the view was amazing! You see all of New York and it's so exciting and fun. The rooms are small but very comfortable, the bed is also comfortable!;4
I stayed here with work. To my horror I was given a room next to the lift! Rochelle at reception sorted this out and was fantastic. My new room was better but still noisy. The hotel suffers from a lack of sound proofing. Fine if on holiday, not so good for work! Nice rooms and lovely staff,just noisy  rooms!;4
Have stayed here before. Great hotel central for all amienities. Our room this time was not so modern but it was immaculate and kept that way throughout. Our only critisism was no fridge which we had previously. We had a view of the Empire State Building this time which was great. Would recommend this hotel and would stay again if we are ever in NYC again.;4
Arrived at this hotel very tired after a very long flight to be told we didn’t have a reservation! This was booked through a travel agent and thankfully I had my paperwork with me! Receptionist was very unprofessional and kept saying I’m checking with our reservation team. We were losing patience with her so she gave us a voucher for a drink at the bar so they could find us a room, this was at 3.45pm we were still sitting in the bar at 6pm! My husband went to the same receptionist again at 6pm to be asked what his name was! she gave the excuse that there was delayed flights and they couldn’t put people out of their rooms! We asked for a manager who was very nice and apologized he put $70 credit on our account for a meal. This was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in,;3
The New Yorker lobby was nice and the rooms were decent. I would stay there again, it was clean. I surprised about the lack of upkeep on the different floors of the hotel. If you get a great deal, I'd definitely go for it but there are other hotels in the same price range that are nicer.;4
Stayed here for 5 nights from 11 May. Room was spotless,serviced every day.Bed was very comfortable and towels nice and fluffy. Reception area is beautiful,security at lift access which is a bonus considering size of hotel. We arrived at 12.30 and we given early check in. Mohamed on the front desk was brilliant,excellent service. Only negative point is the resort fees(??),but I hear this is a New York thing. Another positive is the short distance from Penn Station,even for a first time NYC visitor,you cant miss the hotel. We got train from airport and taxi back to JFK,I would recommend the train both for time and cost.;5
Stayed here for 3 nites in Early May 2018.  Sadly i was left disappointed with this hotel.  It looks very glamoures from the out side & inside with the 40's deco but for me thats where it ends.  The rooms are very basic with no fridge ( much needed in the New york heat ! ) or kettle so you can make a tea or coffee.  Small room not ideal if your in a wheelchair.  The staff where pleasnt and the gaurd by the lifts give you that bit of reassurance that your room is safe.  Be prepared to pay a hotel fee mine was $76 and that was based on a 3 nite stay.  The Hotel is very close to Madison square gardens and Penn station  and 10 minute walk to the empire state building.  sadly this will be my last stay here.;3
"When I arrived I reminded the reception that I was disabled, could hardly walk and also wanted to stay at the same floor as my colleagues.. But I got the room most far from elevator and far from my company. The lady in the reception just said ""I can't promise you anything"", (I did book and payed for it three months earlier). Anyhow, the room was small and dark. Two windows, one of them broken. None of them  could be opened. There was a small television. Bathroom was dirty, a big brown thing on the side very close to the toilet and same nice brown stains on the inside of the door. Just disgusting. The wifi seldom worked 100%. What I saw from my window was just a dirty house wall. The guys standing in front of the elevators were always very nice and so were the waiters serving";2
I have stayed in New York a few times with this hotel my personal favourite for the cost and location. The New Yorker has good security and is clean and tidy with friendly helpful staff. The hotel is about as good as you can get to a central location on a budget. The Empire State Building, Time Square are a couple of blocks away with Maddison Square Garden literally across the street. Great place to stay!;4
"This is a awesome classic hotel (meaning some small rooms), I arrived during a snowstorm, 12 hours late, at 6am after driving in from DC and was quickly checked into my room. I was lucky enough to stay in the ""Nikola Tesla room,"" the room that the famed physicist lived in for many years until his death (No ghost, I left an equation written on the pad for him to finish and he never did, but the lights did flicker once). The location of the hotel is great, walking to everything.   The diner attached to the lobby is open 24 hours, has amazing oreo cake and some pretty fantastic food around the clock if you don't feel like dealing with the hustle and bustle of the city just to get a quick breakfast or late dinner.";4
Stayed here for 5 nights. Nice sized clean bedroom. No frills. If you want somewhere comfortable to stay at reasonable cost then this place is fine. The staff are helpful. Our fridge was not working and it would have been nice to have a kettle in the room.;3
Had a fabulous stay at this hotel, staff were friendly and helpful. had  lovely room which overlooked the Hudson. Very central to everything with Macy's just a short walk away. Would definitely stay here again.;4
I’ve stayed here before and some rooms are good while others are not. Looking at the escape plan on the back of the door, it’s obvious that there are a lot of really small rooms like mine but also some good sized rooms. Don’t just pay the cheapest price or you might be disappointed with the room. The lobby is nice but it feels like a budget hotel walking from the lifts to the guest rooms.  It’s noisy, difficult for me to sleep. The bathroom was basic and although I needed to step into the bath for a shower, it wasn’t possible to take a bath without a bath plug.  Would I stay here again? Yes but not in a small room.;3
Second time in 5 years at the New Yorker. New Yorker always serves its purpose whilst visiting the Big Apple in such a great city I do not spend much time in my hotel room.  One point to note despite my wife and I having 4 bags a stroller and a 3 year old. Not one doorman opened a door for us and also on check in not one member of staff offered to take our bags to our room leaving us to struggle in reception and up the elevators.;4
Walked everywhere restaurants, MSG, shopping and times square! Was a perfect place for a quick weekend getaway!! Wonderful views from our rooms.  Friendly service and smiling faces! Highly recommend!!!;4
Checked in today and booked to stay for 3 nights.  Disappointed as we are staying here due to a recommendation !  Will not stay here again - wish we have booked somewhere else and for how much we have paid to stay, a kettle is not even available.  We have been allocated to the 29th floor, and the room is so basic and tiny.  We have to make do and struggle with space!  Three stars because of the location.   Will not let this spoil our holiday.;3
Stayed here with Family for my 21st birthday. Room was like all New York hotels really small but very well maintained. Comfortable beds and a great view of the Empire State Building from our room. Location was great with subway entrance near front door. Diner inside hotel was also quite nice. Close to Macy’s and Times Square if you want to walk. Would defiantly stay here again.;5
The new Yorker hotel was lovely in the centre of all the things we wanted to see I would recommend you get a new York pass we had a bike for a day with the pass  and use them to go all the way round centrel  park Vist top of the  rock empire state building and a must is the 9 11 very moving;5
We stayed at the New Yorker for 3 days it’s very nice and clean our room - 2 people was small but useable, clean, well presented, great cleaning staff the only gripe would be the shower it was very poor and needs an upgrade, good location and great restaurant right next door open 24 hours i think;4
I arrived early and asked to pre-register. Unfortunately, my reservation wasn't showing in their system but Mohammed worked diligently with his co-worker, Yaevick, to resolve the issue. They were both extremely professional and polite and it was evident that they have a good rapport - which benefits staff and guests greatly! Mohammed was so gracious he even found an upgraded room, waived the fee, and allowed me to check in immediately. He called the room about 30 minutes later to make sure everything was to my satisfaction. As usual, the room was very clean and comfortable. Thanks to Mohammed, Yaevick and the rest of the staff for demonstrating consistent courtesy and professionalism in this charming hotel! I will be back!!;5
Exceptional all around service. Especially great service from Housekeeping staff. The Queen Suite was affordable and accommodating for a week’s stay during my business trip. I would certainly choose this hotel and accommodations again.   D. Lathan Houston, Texas;5
Good hotel and location is amazing ,security is good  at hotel, you have best location of newyork nearby so you  can walk the talk,lobby area is good, staff is good and so you would have a good overall experience in my view;4
Stayed for a girl's weekend celebrating a birthday. Staff were excellent and very friendly. Housekeeping always greeted with a friendly smile. Desk clerk offered superior service. This was my 2nd stay at this hotel from a few years ago. The service and cleanliness has met and exceeded my expectations from my last stay.;5
"This is my 3rd year in a row staying at the  New Yorker to attend the Young Child Expo Conference hosted by Los Ninos. I love the hotel due to its fascinating history and the Art Deco architecture. I am so happy that Wyndham decided to invest in it and  keep the art deco ambience. The location is fantastic with easy access to the subway to get anywhere in New York. Good shopping and close to the Empire State building. Walk over to 9th Avenue for great affordable restaurants that are not ""chain"" restaurants. Walk up 8th Avenue and over a few blocks and you are right at Times Square.  The Italian restaurant off the lobby is very good and I love the Tick Tock diner. You really feel like you are in NYC when you have breakfast there.";5
Very friendly, cooperative staff, great room with 2 full baths!  We love the location...and the doorman helps with cabs, luggage etc in a way that seems old fashioned and charming.  Attached diner a big plus and the historic lobby downstairs should not be missed.lcheck out the Tesla wall.;4
First time to NYC for myself, mum and teenage sister for mum's birthday, hotel honestly made it for us! I'd emailed in advance to mention the birthday and they went above and beyond at check in to make it even more special - double bathroom (essential for 3 women), champagne for my mum and reduced resort fees. Hotel was clean, bed's comfortable and the staff all lovely. Tick Tock diner was quick, clean and tasty, staff absolutely lovely as well, ate there several times after being impressed on the first visit (French toast is AMAZING).  Location was brilliant for pretty much everything, we could walk to where we wanted and a fairly reasonable taxi fare for when we'd had enough walking. Macy's was dangerously close (several visits and purchases made there, we love shopping!) and;5
Fantastic city that surpassed all expectations and the New Yorker hotel was perfect. On 34th Street with Empire State Building and Macys within 5 minutes walk and situated next to Penn Station so easy to get about and see the rest of the city. Hotel was very clean & comfortable and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Tick Tock diner is great for both breakfast and dinner.  The location was ideal for most of the main must see sights and Times Square had the added bonus of us joining in with a world record attempt during our stay. Only there for 4 days but already planning a return and to the New Yorker hotel.;5
Across the street from Madison Square Garden. Very clean. Best shower ever.Water was hot with powerful stream.  Wyndham preferred guest agent was kind and interested in my well being when I could not get early admission to my room.;5
Stayed in the New Yorker hotel  Very comfortable hotel clean rooms and wonderful helpful staff highly recommend  Very central for Times Square , Central Park etc  Right by Maddison square gardens , shops , bars and restaurants;5
Hotel was very convenient to many NYC attractions and Penn Station. Restaurant and 24 hr diner famous Tick Tock Diner  in hotel. Staff very friendly and accommodating. My one complaint is the size of the room. Very small compared to most hotels I’ve have stayed in. Might be normal for NYC. We had several issues when arrived but were immediately corrected. The coffee machine didn’t work, refrigerator was missing and. bathroom faucet loose. No view in lower floor room. Would definitely stay here again.;4
We had problems with our TV and A/C but they fixed them right away.  Great location in NYC.  Tick Tock Diner was perfect for breakfast everyday!  Staff was friendly and always available to assist us with directions.;4
stayed here in april for 3 night myself and my wife, had contacted the hotel to ask for a possible upgrade or a good view months in advance as it was a treat for my 40th, didnt get one our room had a good view but not of the empire state which was a shame but didnt spend much time in it, room was pretty small and bathroom needed updating but was overall pleased with it, lobby of reception is very nice smaller than it looks on the pictures and there can be long lines at check in, there is security near the many lifts who you have to show your room card to i welcomed this, there is no coffee/tea faciltities in your room but if you ask at reception you get one delivered and stocked up for free not sure why they dont just supply that anyway, tic toc diner which is on the corner of;4
Hotel is in very good location, but also quite dated, which  means there is a lot of history in it. We booked one night with 15,000 Wyndham points, which is a really great deal.   We were upgraded free to a suite facing inside. Front desk staff and concierge staffs are very nice. We were also provided two postcards by the lady at the concierge.  There is really not much I could say about. Everything is good and exceeding expectation.;4
"Extremely small rooms with basic attire.  TV's are about 20"" and run the annoying system where you can't see what is on TV without flipping through the channels individually.  The shower temperature is inconsistent.  Bathroom size is so small you can barely sit on the toilet without hitting the door with your knee.  The front desk wasn't overly friendly and parking was $60 per day...add an additional $60 everytime you take it out and bring it back.  I wasn't overly impressed with this property.  The hotel location is nice but I would expect more for the price.";2
Love the New Yorker! Great location, across the street from Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, 10 min walk to Broadway and Time Square. The rooms are reasonably priced and comfortable and the staff are Amazing. The New Yorker is always my home away from home when in NYC.;5
Booked our whole flight and stay through Expedia. Superb location right opposite Penn station and Madison Square Garden, 10 minutes walk to Times Square and handy for restaurants and bars. We paid extra for a room with a view but not sure that was worth it as was hoping for a view of the Empire State building but got a view of Hudson river instead from the 35th floor. Quick check in, polite staff then off to our room 3526. A little dated and tired. Television a bit temperamental...had to unplug it from the wall several times for it to work. Shower ran a bit hot and cold. Air con a bit noisy so couldn't leave it on low at night. Room safe worked fine although a little small. Soundproofing could be better. The resort fee of $30 a night is a bit of a sting in the tail especially if;4
My stay was excellent! Fast and easy check-in process. Muhammad was very friendly and made sure he got me checked-in quickly after learning I had a long day. The rooms were clean and beds are comfortable. Very close walking distance to local attractions.;5
Our stay was perfect! We emailed prior to our stay to ask for a high up room with a view of some sort. We was also celebrating our engagement and we was not disappointed, we was allocated room 4011 - fortieth floor a lovely Art Deco suite. I know others have spoken about refurbished and unrefurbished rooms I would say ours was not a refurbished room but it was everything we wanted it to be. It had lovely Art Deco nods, a separate living space with a sofa, small kitchen area and TV and a bedroom with a tv, safe and wardrobe & drawers. We was blown away with the room and the views was stunning. Every staff member we met was lovely and friendly. OMG I can not write this review without talking about the bed - which was like sleeping on a cloud. It was amazing and I slept so well. I;5
Reading the reviews got me a little concerned about our stay but it was amazing from the moment we walked into reception to be Told we had been upgraded to a suite! The suite was spotless clean and plenty of room and storage. The fridge was very welcome! As for the bed well it shows how brilliant it was as we have come home and bought a bed very similar! We called it the cloud as it was like sleeping on one. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. We had read about the lifts taking a long time to come but we never experienced any delays at the lift bank. I wouldn’t change a thing about the hotel it is in a great spot very handy for the subways and trains and I would stay here again in a heartbeat thank you the New Yorker;5
I have stayed at this hotel twice in the last 2 months the 1st time the room was new totally refreshed and was very nice albeit small the 2nd time this past week I received a very old room that is not been  Refreshed in at least 25 to 30 years. The bathroom was dirty there is very little storage in the bathroom. Carpets were frayed and over all was a very uncomfortable room. The pillows looked like marshmallows but felt like rocks. If you use the hotel demand a new room;2
This is a very convenient and practical hotel that had everything you need.  Rooms were surprisingly spacious and bright with lots of windows, heated bathroom floors and a nice shower, very comfortable bed, plenty of USB ports and power outlets, and free wifi.  It's not a luxury hotel, but for the price and the very central location, it was a pleasantly positive surprise.;5
Wonderful stay at the New Yorker Wyndham Hotel.  Situated  on 8th Avenue close to Times Square & Broadway. Subway right beside the hotel.  Staff very helpful & friendly. Room small but very clean & had everything we needed. Food outlets at the hotel very good. Adette from Ireland;5
We had received a free two night stay after sitting through a 3 hour time share presentation on a previous stay.  We had to pay 60 a day for valet parking and taxes and fees for the two nights.  We had to use valet as my son was staying there as a NY arts study program student and we had to take a full car load back home.  They gave us a better room with a view of the Empire State Building and of Madison Square Garden.  This hotel is old and still had a lot of its old style attributes.  It's rooms are small.  The paint in the bath tub was peeling.  The windows were dirty and obstructed the views.  Everything was small and tight, but it was clean and the bed was comfortable for sleeping.  The tv had a bad connection.  I wish they offered a free breakfast.  I guess this is good;3
An amazing stay with a great view of the river. Hotel was clean and I was well looked after. Hoping to come again soon when next in New York. Wifi included with the stay which was great and loved the staff so friendly and always happy to help.;4
Placed in this hotel by my Company. Art Deco description just means dated and tired!  Tiny rooms, small bathrooms, poor shower pressure and packed Lobby with long queues at reception. Area is central to Macys and Penn station yet pretty grubby with plenty of homeless around. High police presence which says something about the area!  Rooms here seem fairly cheap and this is for a reason, not recommended.;2
The guest rooms are small but adequate. Tic Toc Diner a bit tired. The Butcher and Banker is solid steakhouse. The bar has a nice whiskey selction. Favorite with budget minded European travellers. Must be location of Penn Station next door.;3
"The room was little and the wardrobe was not enough; the two beds, that should give room enough for two adults and one children each one (as declared by the hotel) were not so big and for this reason our nights were not relaxing. The bathroom was like the room: a little place where to stay one by one. OK for the cleanliness.";3
Muhammad was a super great front desk employee & the manager was super sweet and nice ! She’s the best , and the room was amazing lovely view ! I will definitely be back. Although you have to pay 20$ extra for a fridge the treatment was priceless ,;5
As a former New Yorker now residing in Brazil, I recently went back to NYC after an absence of 5 years. I stayed at the New Yorker (13 days) for its location not far from a storage facility where I had my belongings stored. I was there to arrange their  shipment to Brazil.  What a pleasant surprise!!! In my day 8th Avenue, especially between 34th & 42nd streets was a no go zone full of derelicts, pimps, prostitutes and junkies. I made my reservation while holding my nose and expecting the worse in an old building which once housed the headquarters of the Korean reverend Moon. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised at the total change in the area and by the service and quality offered by the hotel at reasonable (for NY!) prices. The nearby Hudson Yards complex now under;4
The Shining anyone? Seriously! The lobby and check in are beautiful. We are no strangers to Art Deco as Miami/South Beach and Beverly Hills are also great destinations with similar style hotels and rooms. The problem here is very old carpets/walls, dimly lit hallways, etc. then to get to the room. We reserved a larger space and received a 150ish square foot closet with an uncomfortable bed that viewed a wall. I called to inquire and offered to pay an upgrade fee for a better room and was told that the hotel was fully booked for that night. Pretty funny that I could check online and reserve a number of rooms there for the same evening. We were traveling on a prepaid voucher so I’m sure that’s why they didn’t want to upgrade. When I called Wyndham reservations FROM THE ROOM, they;2
"First, buyer beware of the fine print. There is a $30 ""facilities"" fee per night.  Doesn't matter if you plan to use any facilities. This is not optional. It is also not clearly disclosed when you book. Since this is not optional, it should be included in the price. Anything else is a gimmick to lure in consumers based on misinformation about prices. I expected better from Wyndham. Second, the rooms are tiny and were last renovated in the 1960s. The corridors are plain miserably and a bit scary. We needed a mini-fridge for medications (an additional $20 by the way) and now we have to jump over it to get in and out of bed. Not impressed. Third, there was the sound from the HVAC system that felt like I was sleeping under a landing plane.  Yeah, I get it, it is Times Square, the";2
Excellent hotel, just a walk from Penn Station, Tick Tock Diner inside had great service and food, amazing viewes and totally reasonable rates! The New Yorker couldn't get better!! Central location, fantastic accommodating staff.;5
The hotel is a bit dated especially on our floor and we had a minimal view but the staff are great and it’s in a great location ! Very good bars , restaurants and shops in the local area  and a good bar in the lobby that’s open until quite late. Very good security on the front aswell so you know you and your belongings are safe when your staying there. Will definitely stay there again.;5
Myself and my family stayed here for a week on 15march 18 on first glimpse of the hotel I thought it was a bit dated. Each member of my group had a room each. Yes they were basic, but it was very clean. Beds a good double. Fresh towels and toiletries replaced daily.  We spent our days out doing the touristy bits.. and it was a delight to come back to the hotel to the comfortable rooms we all had. Three restaurants are within the hotel and they served us well during our stay. Hotel situated within reach of everything. Times Square 15 min walk. Macy and Empire State bldg just round the corner. Very friendly staff throughout. Felt very safe and secure. Will definitely stay there again.;5
This was my second time staying at the New Yorker.  The location is perfect, as it's right across the street from Penn Station.  We were able to check in early, thanks to Mohammed, who waived the early check-in fee.  He was very personable and also gave us complimentary bottles of water.  The room was small but super cute...it's the city...it's only for sleeping anyway!  There was a safe in the closet, lots of plugs including extra usb in the clock, the bed was comfy...there is also wifi included in your fee for both room and lobby areas.  The facility fee also includes use of the business center and fitness center, but we did not utilize either of these.  We did eat at the Tick Tock diner both days...I highly recommend, as the food is always great there!  We are definitely;5
Second stay at the hotel, staff are wonderful, very helpful when we had a medical issue too! Location is terrific and adjoining restaurant is awesome! They will even make transfers to airports for you.  This hotel is within eady walking distance to time square central park and theMet!;5
needs up grading ...brown carpet looked dirty and hard ,,when we first went into room the bed was made but the room had not been cleaned old receipts where lying on the table and there was used soap still in the bathroom I'm glad I ask my wife if she had opened the soap before I showered as we always take shower gel and soap;3
"This hotel is beautiful and an iconic building, well placed for Times Sq activity, the staff were all very polite, helpful and friendly, and the Tick Tock in house restaurant- a very nice ""diner"" vibe with lovely staff and great choices for all meal types. The rooms were ""compact"" but you are only there to shower and sleep, so okay, very clean and attended every morning by room service. It is, I suppose a little tired just by its age more than anything, and make sure you have all you need when you go out for the day as the lifts tend to be difficult/busy, and unless super fit 7-40 flights of stairs is not an option to many:) and you can waste valuable NYC time.";3
So first of all: this hotel will give you the true NYC spirit you crave when you imagine your trip to this wonderful place. Don't bother spending on the other overpriced hi-tech hotels, it's just a place to lay down your tired beat up body after a day of binge-shopping and eating anyway. I live this hotel so much. It's busy and buzzing all the time (but in a good way), every member of the staff will greet you every time with a smile and a little word. Not once did it feel forced, you can see the pride they all take in working there. The stay was already magical as it was, but the big surprise at the end made it unforgettable. We forgot to book a shuttle to the airport 24hrs before leaving. It was raining so catching a cab was impossible (the legend is true). The hotel offered us;5
"Hotel with a lot of history that is well located hotel near Penn Street Station/Madison Square Garden (A,C,E trains right on the corner) — perfect for exploring the city. I stayed for six nights on the 20th floor with fantastic views of Hudson’s Yard. My room was functional and cleaned daily. I was in New York working, and the room was equipped with a good sized desk I could work on and a safe that (snuggly) fitted my 13"" laptop. If I was being critical I’d say the room was quite small and a little dated, and the shower was a small considering my height. This is Manhattan though, and overall for the price paid I think this is a good option.";4
We stayed here for 4 nights from the 20th April. When we arrived reception was very busy, and loud, I had sent an email before travelling asking for a city view and explained it was to celebrate our 40th birthday and our friends first overseas visit since having major surgery and suffering with a chronic illness, when we checked in the receptionist had said they hadn’t allocated our rooms and could’ve get us on the same floor, which was fine. As it was so busy I didn’t ask about our request, as lots of people were waiting to check in. On arrival to our room on the 29th floor was shocked how dark and tired the hallways looked as the reception area looked quite grand. The door to our room was covered in dark brown peeling paint, so not a good first impression.  Our room was small,;3
"I stayed overnight for a quick business trip to New York.  Pros: -proximity to Penn Station (4-6 min. walk) -central, easy to get around   Cons: -expensive  -tiny room with low to medium grade furnishings -closet is too shallow to actually hang clothing where the lock box sticks out -noisy -tiny bathroom with no place to put your shaving kit; hot and cold knobs reversed on tub/shower  I expected more from a Wyndham but it was only a night";2
We stayed for a 3 night break for an anniversary trip, this last weekend.  I am a travel agent, so probably the worst when booking my own breaks... it took a long time to choose this hotel, we didn't want a standard chain hotel, but one that was typical New York, good location and had a bit of history attached.  This hotel ticked all the boxes.  Check in and lobby area was really busy, however the ladies behind the desk were really quick to work the queue, so we didn't wait too long anyway.  Our room wasn't quite ready for us immediately, but that was fine as we left our cases and headed out for a bite to eat.  It was worth the wait, we were really lucky to be upgraded to a suite, room 3809.  We had our own lounge, sink area with fridge and drink machine, room with a queen bed;5
Fabulous Hotel, wonderful location and a throwback to a by gone age. At a similar price to the Sherborne on Lexington Avenue we thought we’d give the New Yorker a chance. It really is difficult to directly compare. The rooms are small but more than adequate, the corridors are reminiscent of ‘The Shining ‘. Throw in the Art Deco design. The location is just brilliant. Handy for transport links, midtown attractions and Hell’s Kitchen. The staff where super helpful and sorted out an error with our bill with little fuss. It’s not a modern hotel but what it lacks in that area it makes up in others. We where right above Nikola Tesla’s rooms which was cool. Definitely the place to stay when we return to NYC.;5
Booked this hotel for my 50th as it looked nice and central and had good reviews. Emailed the hotel asking for an upgrade as it was a special birthday. Travel agent done the same to increase our chances. Didnt mind paying a little extra. On arrival staff were friendly and they gave us a bottle of champagne as it was my birthday. We were disappointed in our room. Very small and clean but needed updating and looked out on to an abandoned building with graffiti and smashed windows. Spoke to some other guests who said their room was like new. They also had a tea maker which we didn't. So disappointed after trying hard to make sure we had a lovely room before arrival. Expensive for a basic room.;3
Hotel is in perfect location and the staff are absolutely outstanding. The hotel is very safe and the security are amazing and they do there jobs very well indeed. The rooms have a different view for each section of the building but all views are great. The air con and heating is great and you can never fault.;5
"We are a family of six people that stayed at the Wyndham in April for 4 nights. We booked our room 7 months in advance through Booking.com. Through our booking process we got the info that the hotel was to be paid upon arrival. I notified the hotel that we would arrive appr. 8pm. When we arrived we got a really rude employee who, at first, did´nt seem to find our booking and then claimed that the card had been declined. I told her that the booking confirmation had said ""pay upon arrival"" and that there should not be any problems with the card but she kept interfering when I was speaking in a very rude manner saying that whenever one books through the internet, one should always call before arrival to check if the card is ok. Well....I have travelled many countries and stayed at";2
Stayed here for the second time. First time was 5 years ago. Still loved it!   The room was and had a a view. The staff is really nice and helpfull. Next time when I visit NY, I will defenitly stay at this hotel;4
"We booked The New Yorker on a whim last December as we we're looking for a cheap deal for just before Christmas. Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised however, the hotel itself feels far more expensive than it actually is. I've stayed at some more expensive hotels whilst in New York but the New Yorker comes out on top.  After explaining what a terrible journey we'd had after multiple delays from the UK, the concierge upgraded us right away to one of the newly refurbished executive rooms which was a nice surprise! The room was massive by New York standards, with 2 large double beds, a desk, plenty of space and amazing views. The only downfall was the bathroom, which is very small and dated; i'd imagine this is probably next on the list for a refurbishment. It was clean and";5
This was our last stop on a US honeymoon tour. I knew NY was going to be hustle bustle and noisy. What I was hoping for was a good hotel to retreat and refresh.  At check in we had good idea of how busy this hotel is. Flight crews, conference groups blocking reception area. There were less busy moments. When we were checking in I mentioned we were on honey moon and Afrosa did her best to find us a good room. The hotel was sold out. She did say room was good and sent us a complimentary bottle of quality red wine. The outcome of room was not what we expected. You couldnt get a cat in there let alone swing one. 27 floors up in alcove looking down on 8th and 34th street. The street noise was louder than expected, the room and bathroom were tired, the bed was small, though very;3
If you’re coming to New York to stay in the heart of Manhattan, with Times Square a 15 minute walk and the empire outside your window - then this is the perfect spot. Price wise it’s a cheap deal, the rooms are pretty poor and basic. But the bed is comfortable and you’ll get a good nights sleep. You cant swing a cat in there so I can imagine the basic rooms would be a bit of a squeeze for two of you, but really it’s all you need for a city break. Spend your money on more important things like shows and going up the rock!   Enjoy :);4
I love this hotel. I stay here whenever I'm in New York. The location is just by Macy's and a short walk to times square.  The rooms are a good size and the staff are friendly. Be prepared for a queue when shaking in and out. I also love the tick rock diner that's attached to the hotel for breakfast.;5
Diagonally across the street from Pen Station, it is close to all the necessities of transportation in and out of Manhattan.  Easy walk to many attractions including Times Square, Empire State Building, the UN and Lincoln center (all are about a mile to a mile-and-a-half.  Plus the subway station is just downstairs.  Nice rooms without huge prices.  Good service and clean well kept and updated facility.  We will use it many more times as NYC is about a once a year trip to see family.;4
A disappointing start to our 7 night stay when my friend and I checked in . We had booked our room June 2017 for what we thought  online was a twin room but on arrival was told this was just a “ preference based on availability at check in”. Check your small print folks! The receptionist had zero interest in attempting to get us into a twin room. I asked 3 times for her to check or ask if any options were available but she was insistent that the hotel was full although it is a massive hotel with people coming and going all the time . After this initial disappointment and lack of effort by reception staff I wasn’t sure what to expect in the room ... thankfully the room was ok . We were on floor 26 room 2605. The corridors are a bit dated and shabby but the room itself was ok. No;3
went to NYC for Beauty con and when we got to this hotel we could not believe how we were treated! The man at the front desk refused us a room meanwhile we had it booked for MONTHS! He was prejudiced against us because my cousin asked to be close to an exit. It was the worst experience I have ever witnessed. We had all our bags and luggage and had to be out in the city streets with nowhere to go. It was horrifying and embarrassing. When booking.com called the hotel they said it was because of the exit thing as well. The man also spoke very broken English which didn’t help his unprofessionalism. I strongly advise you to find another hotel!!!! DISGUSTING!! I hope this happens to one of his relatives so he can see how it feels to be left in the street with your luggage for a hotel;1
We stayed here in April as a party of six women on a shopping trip from Ireland. We were offered a complimentary upgrade at check-in which resulted in a larger room with a second bathroom. The staff were great - especially the receptionists. We also pre-booked a private transfer from and to JFK with John in the hotel’s concierge service which turned out to be very reliable. The hotel is in close proximity to the Empire State Building and Macy’s. Furthermore, the Port Authority Bus Station was only a 5-minute walk for the day we went to Woodbury Common. The hotel rate was very reasonable and the rooms clean but not fussy. I would recommend to others - particularly for shopping trips.;4
Really great hotel. Perfect location to see all the iconic nyc sites. On site tick tock diner does amazing food and drinks but is expensive. Next to Penn station. We were given a conplimentry upgrade as I'd emailed to ask so its worth asking the question as we had a huge room with 2 bathrooms! Would certainly stay here again.;4
Had a full week at the Wyndham NY. Big opulent hotel with a room with a view. Got very helpful assistance from Anthony and John at the concierge desk, giving me the encouragement I needed to use the subway!! I was scared but I did it and feel like I can tackle anything after that!! Asking people along the way, I went from 9/11 memorial downtown to Tom’s restaurant uptown for the Seinfeld restaurant all by myself!! You haven’t had the full NY experience til you rubbed shoulders with real NewYorkers on the subway and enjoyed a full band with double bass player right in the subway. Thanks Anthony for believing in me!!! “You can do this!!” (In full NY accent), I will always remember this :);5
I had a wonderful stay at The New Yorker. I was here for 7 days and loved every minute of it. Jasmin and Brenda at the Club Wyndham desk were especially lovely. Jasmin signed me up for the free breakfast and tour. I had a wonderful time with Sebastian who showed me around. Jasmin is gifted. She has been extremely efficient and knowledgeable about the job. I cannot say enough about Jasmin, she is keenly aware of her environment so she can accommodate the guests and is very willing to help, is pleasant, good natured and beautiful, she even lifted my suitcase. I went to the breakfast and it was a productive experience, I might even travel to Europe on the program. I will definitely be back at the New Yorker.;5
We had a brilliant stay, upon checkin Mohammed was very friendly and helpful. He really made us feel welcome, even called our room 5 mins after check-in to check that everything was OK. Great location, opposite Penn station and close walking distance to everything. Room was very clean and comfortable. Mattress and pillow were super comfy. Will certainly stay here again.;5
"This was one of the few hotels i stayed in while in NYC. I was there for 8days, so wanted to try a different one every 2 or 3 days.  The location is good, right outside the Penn subway, a huge building , but it had its FLAWS. When i walk into a hotel, it just not need to be nice and clean and beautiful and awesome, its needs to have friendly and respectable STAFF. Entering the hotel with luggage, they are not helpful. Than they have this sad and unwelcome look on their face, like as if i am staying for free. While trying to reach for the elevators, there is this security (good we all need to be and feel secured), but they behave like the bouncers from a night club. They have no smile either, they ask ""WHICH FLOOR, YOUR ROOM KEYS PLEASE, ETC"". One feels intimidated. For a moment";1
We stayed here for one night whilst in NYC again and found it to be a great.  The location is perfect directly opposite Penn station and within walking distance to everything.  The staff are friendly, the hotel is clean, comfortable and well equipped and its right next to Tick Tock diner which is great for breakfast.  Would definitely stay here again.;5
Having stayed at The New Yorker on several other occasions I was not surprised at the exceptional customer service we experienced from check-in (thank you, Miguel, for the smooth transition) to check-out.  Our room on this particular trip was an Executive Suite, which is located in the corporate section (floors 7 or 9) with no view.  Although we typically prefer a corner suite with a view our options were limited at booking and I cannot fault the property.   Having the subway station (blue line-A,C,E trains) at the corner helps considerably since the weather was wet, windy and quite cool.  The central location to the city makes navigating simple.  And, finally, the Tick Tock Diner is usually the tiebreaker if we have other properties we are considering for our stays in NY.;5
This hotel has a nice location in Manhattan and two diners/restaurants at the base. The room is relatively small, but to be expected in NYC. It's a bit dated, so it's not luxurious, but adequate for staying in a safe, nice place in NYC.;4
This hotel was part of a BA package and chosen mainly for the location. Not expecting much as have been to NY before and found hotels small and showing their age. Was pleasantly surprised to find a good sized room for 3 of us and a tired but perfectly serviceable bathroom. Asked for hot drink machine and this was delivered within 30 minutes. All phone calls and wifi free. Diner in hotel was good and reasonable value. Opposite Penn station with the LIRR to JFK. We had a corner room on the 29th and it was very quiet.;4
Our stay at the New Yorker over 6 nights was memorable for a variety of reasons.  The hotel's location next to Penn Station was perfect for our airport transfer from JFK and use of our subway metro card across the city for sightseeing and by foot we were a mere 15 minutes walk from Times Square and the shows on Broadway on 7th Avenue. The Hotel's Tick Tock Diner was convenient for breakfast and an early start for our packed day ahead and we felt safe and secure in the knowledge that hotel security allowed only guest card holder access to lift elevators and up to hotel rooms. A big thank you to Mohammed of guest services who made check in run so smoothly after a long flight from the U.K.  Recognizing that it was my wife's 40th birthday he not only arranged a complimentary bottle;5
We enjoyed our stay and found the hotel adequate. Friendly staff always wiling to help. Location is fantastic for our needs - its an 45min walk from the world trade centre. 15mins from Times Square. Hotel is dated - yeah i know its art deco but the decor is tired, the tiles in the bathrooms need grouted. carpets are wearing thin. Hot and cold water wouldnt mix well to get an adequate temp - too hot or too cold. Would i stay here again - definitely. Would my wife - probably not. Cost is good though so it depends on circumstances i am sure;4
We stayed here in April to tour Colleges with my Daughter, and selected this hotel because of location to Penn Station and because it was a larger hotel. We came in on a red-eye and arrived at about 8 am. Since I was a Wyndham Rewards member they gave us our room right away so we could rest before our first college tour, which was nice. The room was very clean and well-appointed, and the size was typical for New York (smallish) with a queen sized bed. Bathroom was tiny, but I realized that was because of the layout of the building. They do charge a 'Facility Fee' for the Business Ctr, Health Ctr, which was a bit much since we didn't use those services. Also they cater to school groups in the spring, so the lobby was always busy but Hotel is surprisingly quiet at night. Overall a;4
We stayed here for my husbands 30th and it didn't disappoint. The location was so central and being next to Penn Station was great, definitely take advantage of being so close to the subway-if only to save your feet. 5-10 minutes walk to the empire state building and times square, a perfect base to explore. We were given early check in and after an initial mix up and a room change we happily settled into a corner room on the 35th floor with an amazing view! The room we stayed in looked like it had been recently refurbished, it was clean with a very comfortable bed and great shower. The room may have been classed as a bit on the small side but as a couple we were happy, and who spends time in their hotel room in New York. The room had a safe, iron and board, TV and hairdryer as;4
Stayed here for 5 nights to celebrate my 50th birthday. Reception staff are lovely especially the lovely Krystle ,in fact all the staff we spoke to where so very helpful and friendly. Location is really good. Rooms are lovely with the comfiest bed ever. The coffee bar guy was really friendly in the morning and saves you going out to get coffee as it's right there in the lobby. Security in the hotel was very strict as having to show your key before getting into the lifts. Tick tick diner food was awesome especially the pancakes. I would most definitely recommend this hotel and can't wait to return;5
I just loved the quirkiness of this hotel. The foyer was grand and inviting. The lift area, hall ways and room decor very much reminded us of the shining film which added to its character. The family room (two double beds) was small and the bathroom was dusty around the paint work. The beds and bathroom suit and towels were immaculate and incredibly comfortable. We each slept with one of our young children so that we had more room! The room had an iron and ironing board, hairdryer, and mini toiletries. The staff (as we found all over Manhattan) were friendly and very helpful. When we arrived we were given the choice of rooms and allowed to enter early (thank you Mohammed) The diner was good for breakfast but there is a pub called ‘Houndstooth’ a few blocks down as you turn left;3
Great stay at the New Yorker. People friendly and helpful. Great location to see New York. We were however a little disappointed with the size of our family room as it was very small for 4 people. I spoke to the manager on checkout and he was happy to waver the resort fees.  Would definitely stay again but in a bigger room I hope.;4
"I was Charged an additional hidden daily ""facility fee"" that was also taxed.This was not disclosed at reservation, check in or at check out.I called to sort it out.Hotel Rep was very RUDE!! Bad Form!!";1
The stay was fine. The room was not at all what was said to be. Check-in was not good. The lady checking us in was rude and short tempered and just appeared to be exceptionally annoyed. The $22 a day for WiFi was not told to us before registration and we only used it for an hour each day...a tad pricey I think!;4
I have just spent 4 nights in this hotel with my husband and two children. We have been to New York before and stayed in a different (and lovely) hotel (which actually was cheaper) but, despite some of the dubious reviews I read, we went with the New Yorker - we spend minimal time in our hotel room after all. I was so disappointed though.   We checked in and were charged a daily 'service fee' of $22 per night - it's purely a money making tool, for using services like the gym etc and making international phone calls. I mean, like I'm going to sit in my room making phone calls when I'm in New York City! At check in, they also kept our credit card details for a security deposit style holding payment. This was obviously in case we damaged the room, but once we got to our room door,;2
Location:  Very good location. 10/15mins walk to Times Square, near many theatres, cinemas etc. Subway right at the hotel, so very easy access to all mail attractions in the city.  Hotel:  Note: i have not visited NY before but am a frequent traveler, so will review, based on experiences had around the world.  The hotel is very worn. Everything in it could need a renovation. The water temperature of the shower kept changing and more often than not there was a distinct smell of fried food in the room. Beds are to the soft side. The doors close very loudly and you can hear your neighbors speak clearly in your own room. It is in the very low end, when compared to other three star hotels i have stayed in.  They charge a extra  mandatory fee they call a facility fee. 29USD plus;2
We arrived a few days before my daughters 21st and when we checked in at the desk we were told that we were going to be upgraded to a suite for my daughters birthday and she was given a complimentary breakfast coupon for the tick tick diner. When we got up to the suite on the 23rd floor we were amazed to find we had a view of the Empire State and Madison Square Garden! The suite was a little dated but very clean, the bedroom was relatively quiet because it was set back from the road and the beds were lovely a comfortable, especially the pillows! The hotel is very central and right next to Penn Station, so no need to walk very far.   I would like to thank The New Yorker for the upgrade and making my daughters 21st a birthday to remember!;5
"I am a repeat visitor to The New Yorker and consistently am treated with courtesy and an effort to make sure my stay is comfortable and pleasant.  Excellent staff takes care of needs of guests. Rooms are clean; beds very comfortable.  A minute or 2 from the nearest subway station and almost across the street from Penn Station.  After happily spending my last 4 birthdays at the New Yorker, I shall look forward to spending my next one there.  Highly recommend this hotel.";5
We took the trip to New York for opening day with the Yankees! Wouldn’t have been the same trip without staying with Wyndham.    We have been staying with Wyndham every since our first stay with the company back in 2016. The staff is always awesome, not to mention when they found out it was my birthday celebration so they sent up a bottle of champagne on the house.  Always setting the bar- ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️;4
We had a great time in NYC.  The hotel is close to major subway lines and a direct subway line to JFK airport.  Service was great and we have nothing to complain about;5
We arrived at this hotel from the UK at 3pm to stay for three nights as the first stop of our honeymoon. It also happened to be my birthday.   We queued for about twenty minutes to check in to then be told our room wouldn’t be ready until 4pm. As we were only staying for 3 nights we left our cases and went out for the rest of the afternoon. We returned just before 8pm with the intention of having a shower and head out for the evening. We were told our room was still not ready. The concierge said that the previous guests had left late but that house keeping were cleaning it as he spoke (‘not out problem, find us another room’ I thought but didn’t want to start the honeymoon off on a bad note) The concierge gave us a drinks token each and told us he’d get us from the bar when it;2
We stayed here for a long weekend (Friday - Monday).  The location is perfect. About 1 minute walk to Madison Square Gardens and 5 minutes to Macy's and Empire State Building. Times Square is 10 mins and Central Park about 15 mins.   Really beautiful  hotel and lovely, friendly staff.  Visable security at the lifts was very reassuring, no access without showing room card first .  We had a family room with 2 double beds and although not massive it was plenty big enough.. this is New York after all.  En-suite was immaculately clean as was the room. No kettle or tea/coffee making in the room which was a shame but there are so many places to buy that it's not that much of an issue.  Would definitely stay here again without hesitation.;5
From the moment i got here i got into a big problem. When i arrived at the city airport JFK i took a taxi to my hotel the new yorker wyndam and was scammed for 200 dollars to get there. Im only a student so you can imagine that amount of money loss hurting me. Additionally the worst thing happend to me, i left my phone in the taxi and could not call him because he gave me a fake number. so whilst feeling lost and all alone in a big city like this The Gentlemen Anthony Armenio and his fellow collegue Jennifer Perez helped me tremendously. there kindness and helpfullness was very much needed and appreciated!. Jennifer even lent me here private phone to try and contact my new yorker friends and my vather which was more then just a nice gesture. I am deeply thankful for all the help;5
Although I loved the historic hotel and its has been renovated very nicely the service is below par.  The good:   Location is central and less than two blocks from Penn Station which is great if you arrive by Amtrak.   It is a historic hotel that has been very nicely renovated. Rooms are very small but nicely done Price was very reasonable for Manhattan  The Opportunities for Improvement:  I arrived at 9:30PM and was told my room wasn't ready!  Never had that happen at any hotel I've stayed in before after 4pm and this was 9:30!!!  The front desk clerk suggested I check my bags and get something to eat and my room SHOULD be ready by then.  When I asked how long should I expect for the room to be ready she said 90 MINUTES!  Meaning I wouldn't be able to got to my room until;3
This was the first time any of our family had visited New York and the New Yorker was the perfect place to stay. We checked in quickly to a family room with two bathrooms. Whilst some people might consider the halls and room a bit dated, they hah a certain classic charm and we're very clean and tidy. The excellent maid service kept them that way over our four day stay. Our room had a very useful fridge but my top tip is to request a coffee pod machine (which also makes a decent cup of tea, which is important for us British). The pods were replenished daily. All the staff I spoke to were incredibly friendly and helpful. One thing that surprised me was that international calls are free from the rooms. The hotel is very well located for sightseeing, just across from Penn Station;5
Had a fantastic stay at the New Yorker. All the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Our room on the 31st floor had a stunning view down 34th St looking over Madison Square Garden and facing the Empire State Building, beautiful at night. It is within easy walk of Times Square, The Highline and Macys and right next to Penn Station for easy access across the city and beyond. The room was quite small but spotlessly clean and surprisingly quiet. Housekeeping staff were excellent and brought us a coffee machine free of charge with daily top ups. The hotel itself looks fantastic, maintaining its art deco details and fittings. A small museum in the basement gives some idea of the history of the hotel and is worth a visit. The Tick Tock Diner adjacent to the hotel and accessible;5
Second visit to this hotel and on this occasion, I was upgraded to a newly refurbished room which was very small. There is hardly anywhere to put your luggage if you are on a lengthy vacation.  The location of the hotel is excellent, very close to Macy’s, Maddison Square Garden and the Empire Weekend, the Tic Toc Diner attached to the hotel is an excellent place to eat and drink and the 8th avenue express (subway) is right outside which gets you quickly to other places in the city.;4
We stayed at the New Yorker for 5 nights with our two teenage sons. We had a wait for checkin when we arrived as it as busy, but we got a free upgrade on one of our rooms so our boys room was near ours. We stayed on the 7th floor, the rooms were  very clean and had tea & coffee facilities. The staff were very helpful and the tick tock diner is good for breakfast, the triattori bianca Italian restaurant is superb for just a drink (happy hour 12-6.30pm) and the food is fantastic. It’s the location of the hotel that is the best, it’s centrally located to most of the things you want to see when staying in New York. We had tickets to watch the New York Knicks on the Saturday evening, we were literally across the road from Madison Square Gardens! We would definitely stay at the New;5
뉴욕에 잠깐만 있게되서, 정말 잘 보내고 싶다는 생각에 호텔도 이곳저곳 알아봤는데요. 아무리 생각해봐도 좋은 뷰가 있어야 좋을거같단 생각에 결국엔 여길 골랐어요. 시설 안좋은건 리뷰 보고 알고 있었고요. 잘만하면 엠파이어 스테이트 빌딩 보이는 방 고를 수있는거같은데 이건 30층 이상이어야 뷰가 가리지 않고 보일 수 있을 것 같아요. 저는 일부러 City View Room으로 추가비용 내고 예약했는데, 원하는대로 고를 수 있더라고요. 다만 높은층 엠파이어 빌딩 방향은 이미 다 예약이 차서 대신 허드슨강쪽 뷰로 받았는데 여기도 만족이예요. ^-^ 지나가다가 전에 고민했던 호텔들 하나씩 보는데, 다들 층수가 낮더라고요. 여기가 가성비는 좋은거같아요. Resort Fee랑 Facility Fee 청구되는거 다들 참고하시고요 :) 저는 미리 알고있어서 별 불만은 없었어요.  It was really great to have this view. I already knew that this hotel's facility is far behind than other hotels, so I'm so satisfied. My room is in 34th floor, facing Hudson River, it is so great. Of course, location is the best. Just one step to the penn station.;5
Staff could not be more helpful with everything from directions to printing off tickets for us. Some of the decor was a little tired and in need of an update in the corridors and in the bathroom. The communal areas were to a high standard though.;4
Ideal location, but overpriced, and some staff dishonest. Most I should say we’re very pleasant. But checkin clerk told us there was a $10 fee for WiFi, one off. This turned out to be Every day so we paid 50 instead of 10. After the cost of this hotel, it’s simply dishonest. The $45 dollar a day retainer also seems a little high also, although you do get this back minus the charges.  Would we stay again? Likely not! The hotels dated, but filled with history so whilst the corridors look like something from the The Shining, it’s actually tolerable.;3
Well located as by Penn station which was convenient as we arrived from Boston by train. Disappointing to not get our room until 7:30pm, kind of left a bad impression. To credit the hotel they compensated us with a couple of drinks and a couple of free breakfasts but I would have preferred the room to be ready on time. I loved the art deco style of the building and the room was an OK size with some nice city views. The tick tock diner was quick and efficient at serving us and the Italian restaurant was pretty good too.;4
Good location, near Macy’s & the Empire State Building. Good sized rooms with 2 bathrooms that could accommodate a family. Check in was straightforward even though the reception area was very busy. The hotel reception area was always busy but never waited long for a lift. Would definitely stay here again.;5
I booked this hotel in a hurry and didn't read the reviews until later in the day AFTER I had booked a non-refundable reservation (my bad). Reading TripAdvisor quickly didn't look like any real issues but if you read some other sites - whoa! Make sure you read all the reviews. I do think a disclaimer needs to be made though - if you've never stayed in NYC, then you WILL be shocked at how small and old ALL the hotel rooms in the city are. It just is what it is. So yes, this hotel falls into the same category. It's super old and the hotel room size is almost claustrophobic compared to other cities. I checked in with a friendly agent, went up to the room and the keys didn't work so I had to go back down (29 floors) and she had made a mistake writing the room number but she gave me;3
We enjoy staying at Wyndhams typically and after years of staying other places in Times Square, this time I went for a place close to Penn station since we are in and out after 1 night. What a disappointment. For over $300 you would think the room would be big enough for you to keep your suitcase open. We found one spot where we could open it up but it was in the middle of the walkway so it had to be opened and closed each time you needed something. I know it’s NYC and rooms are small but I’ve never had one this small.   I don’t know how much you have to pay for the views the others talked about, ours did not get us a view (see picture).   Check in wasn’t friendly, the lady that checked us in at the members desk asked us no questions, gave us no information on the hotel or;2
New Yorker is a convenient and comfortable hotel. Easy access to most tourist points. All staff very courteous and friendly. Rooms can be a bit tiny and a problem if you have lots of luggage. Otherwise, get out and enjoy the city.;4
Brilliant hotel fresh looking and spotlessly clean,rooms not very big,but you are only sleeping there,found all the staff pleasent and helpful,not all rooms have tea making facilities in,enjoyed my stay there;5
On the one hand I have to agree with other reviewers who said that the hotel is a bit worn, the rooms slightly small and the walls seem to be thin. On the other hand, this hotel has a lot more charm and character than most, the location is terrific, and the staff (at the check in desk, the concierge, and housekeeping) were extremely professional, courteous, and helpful.  I would definitely consider coming back, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the New Yorker!;4
We travelled to New York as a family of five (kids aged 13, 11, 10) and spent two weeks at the New Yorker. I was worried as I had read some bad review but right for the beginning our stay was fantastic. We arrived late in the afternoon and Krystal on check in was so helpful even organising champagne for us as the trip was a 40th birthday celebration. Since we were staying an extended period of time they reduced the daly fee which was really nice. The location was great and so close to lots of restaurants and the subway. We ate in both restaurants and the service was great, even on Christmas morning when they were exceptionally busy. The room was big enough for the five of us and even had a second bathroom so there was plenty of room for us. We would definitely stay here again.;5
Hotel is in a good location, opposite Madison Square Gardens. First impressions of the hotel is that it is well used but is clean, which I believe is all you need for a city break as we spent very little time in the hotel. Stayed on the 24th floor and had a view of Empire State Building. Hotel staff were pleasant and helpful. Good security. Free WiFi. Overall good value and I would stay here again.;4
Room was rather small but had all we wanted as we only slept there.,if you want a fridge or kettle you have to pay extra there's an ice bucket,and ice machines on most floors if you want to keep drinks chilled it's in an excellent position to get to any where,ask for a room with a view of they can they will accommodate at no extra cost ,we had a fabulous view of the empire state building,would recommend a hop on hop off bus pass,these can be bought on any street corner and the guys and girls who sell them are really friendly and even took us to the nearest stop,we had a two day pass;5
The room was very small with no adequate room for our toiletries. The bar restaurant and the Tick Tock restaurant had an inadequate number of servers to consider eating at. Called the front desk about a bag the airline sent over and I was told I had to come for it without even asking to have it delivered. I felt that was rude and unprofessional. Otherwise everything else was good.;3
We visited the New Yorker for my 40th birthday.  The staff were excellent and gave me a warm welcome and treats for my birthday. The hotel itself is beautiful and has stuck close to it's 1920s history. The decor is stunning and the styling continued throughout, even to the bathroom fittings. The room was not massive but was all that we needed and was clean. We had a view to the very funky and lit up buildings across the street. The location is excellent, right over the road from Madison Square Garden,  close to the Highline and a 10 minute walk to Times Square.  I would love to stay here again!;5
The hotel is convenient and comfortable. Nice lobby spacious modern rooms. Unfortunately something was wrong with housekeeping and I was not able to get a room until 8:30pm. Not so good when checkin is supposed to be at 4:00pm. Many other guests had the same issue as we waited in the lobby. The staff were sympathetic but never explained why. Too bad because the hotel itself is very nice and a decent value for the price. As a busy traveler, this inconvenience makes me unwilling to try this hotel again.;2
The hotel is in a excellent location by foot or the subway for all the major attractions which was great. The hotel room was very clean with clean towels each day, shampoo, soap was supplied.Tea and coffee machine supplied at a extra cost,  the maids were very friendly with excellent customer service and cleaned the room to very high standards. Tick tock diner which is part of the hotel was very nice  however when you order a cup of coffee you only get half of a cup  when my husband question this he was told thats the way it comes, lucky for us Starbucks is only over the road to the hotel.Third day into the holiday I broke my ankle which ment we had to stay another 4 days at the hotel until I was clear to fly, I really felt it for my husband because the reception staff were not;3
stayed here for a week and it was fantastic. the room was a bit small but what do you need when out all day. the position of the hotel was brilliant. right in the middle of manahtten within walking distance to all the attractions. would stay again.;5
My wife and I visited NYC to see the Macy's Flower Show. We chose the New Yorker because of its location. When we arrived at noon, our room was ready. The hotel staff at registration was friendly and organized. The cleaning staff was friendly. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The elevators worked quickly and efficiently. We were able to get a cab quickly. We plan to stay at the New Yorker again when we visit NYC.;5
I arrived after a harrowing 2 hours at JFK only to be greeted warmly by Mohammed. He proceeded to shower me with upgrades and freebies due to both my birthday (while giving me a great discount on my age! What a charmer!!!) Also because my friend is recovering from cancer. In spite that he claimed there was no 2 bedded room available because the hotel is booked up, and instead he offered 2 breakfasts, I almost fainted upon entering the room which was a double!!!!! Not only that, but also high up with a view. Incredible!  Also every whim was met immediately amd with a smile, fixing the lamp, bringing a coffee maker ...and bottled water for it! I cannot believe that when I asked for a Timeout magazine, which they do not provide, a staff memer brought us up 2 copies of City Life;5
The first room I was given had not been cleaned (very busy at change over time) but an amazing view of the Empire State Building. The next room was spotless but the view was of a wall of windows. The staff are efficient and very obliging. I was given breakfast vouchers for the week by way of compensation. Well situated for all major attractions either by foot or the subway under the hotel. This was the fourth time I have stayed at the hotel. And would not hesitate to recommend it to others. There are no drink making facilities in the room.;4
We stayed here for 3 nights following a trip to Reykjavik and it ticked all the boxes for us! The room was clean and surprising quiet which meant you could wind down after a busy day in the city. The Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel does a mean brekkie too! And great coffee! All in all, a very good stay!;4
Having stayed several times at The New Yorker - my experiences have always been top notch!   From swift and professional check-in to very nicely remodeled rooms in keeping with the Art Deco architecture, to a great price. I love the central location and am amazed at the professional staff dealing with large groups and special requests with aplomb.  The New Yorker is my go to hotel!;5
I would like to thank staff at hotel they couldn't  have been any nicer and thank you for helping my daughter have a memorable 21st in New york. Our room had amazing view loved it every day and night time was spectacular.  Hotel was Beautiful  all staff were very helpful and accommodating.  Would definitely  go back and would recommend  .x Loved our coffee maker in morning and had fridge  with water and cola again thank you.;5
Stayed five nights, amazing hotel with real old time charm to it. Had a suite on 38th floor with front view of Empire State building....fabulous. Rooms were clean and modern, cleaned daily and comfortable. Bottled water and canned drinks complimentary. Diner and restaurant attached to hotel. Had a fantastic time.;5
Nice hotel right in the centre of Manhattan. Very close to Madison Square Garden and Penn train station. Times Square was a pleasant fifteen minute walk. Staff were friendly and helpful and security at the hotel was well managed. The hotel room was small but comfortable. Nice bed and while on the 31st floor, it was pretty quiet. Bathroom had a bath and nice toiletries. The hotel's Tick Tock diner was excellent with great food and service, the breakfasts were enormous.;4
Very expensive hotel and if want to leave your language at the hotel then you should pay 3 dollars which I find it bad and I believe it should be free of charge. The hotel it self is nice with helpful stuff;3
This is the 4th time we have stayed here.  This Hotel continues to be great value for money. Probably the best feature is the location. On top of Penn Station, Opposite MSG and walking distance to the ESB and Times Square.  Parts of the hotel are looking a little tired but nothing major. Room was on the small side but who cares.  Check in was good. We arrived about 8:00am and were provided a room by 9:30am. Would definitely recommend.;4
Easy check in, we were upgraded to a view room on the 39th floor.  Amazing View!  Room was small as expected but very comfortable.  Bottled water and soft drinks included.  Coffee maker was great for morning coffee before we ventured out for breakfast.  Many restaurants near by.  Great location, easy to get around by walking, subway and Penn station .  Enjoyed our stay to the max!;5
The staff was friendly and very helpful.  The lobby was gorgeous and I spent my down time there, people and dog watching.  The coffee cart in the lobby was a welcome sight.  The concierge desk staff signed me up and/or got my tickets for events that I wished to see.  Cozy rooms cleaned to perfection awaited me every night.  The security staff provided piece of mind.  I will be back!;5
The New Yorker is an AWESOME hotel! Clean and friendly staff!  The TicToc dinner has good late night food.;5
This hotel is very convenient but is showing its age. The lobbies and rooms are very worn at least on our level. The room was quite good with windows on two sides as it was s corner room. American hotels need to understand the benefits of providing a fridge and coffee making facilities in their rooms. It was convenient also having the 24/7 Tick Tock Cafe downstairs for meals at any time.;4
The New Yorker is well situated for getting around and only a short stroll to the glitz of Times Square.  Well insulated and no noise even though in a busy area. Front desk and Concierge staff were really helpful and not at all aloof like a lot of big hotels.;5
Excellent hotel.  Clean and comfortable.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Excellent location as situated just back from the main street with restaurants/pubs etc. very easy to public transport and not far from the theatre's;5
Great location, accommodating staff, very helpful, the room was tight but comfortable. Love the old style of the building. Very easy to public transport an d walkable to heaps of good eating. Been a couple of times and always good;5
Stayed in Sept 2017 for 5 days with my boyfriend.  Check in was smooth and we were allocated a room above 20th floor which allowed us to use the fast lift. Room was small but comfortable and just what you expect from NY.  Location was great as we were central to everything we wanted to do.;4
What a fabulous location!  This hotel is located within easy access to all the main highlights in New York.  We were greeted by Linda on the desk, who was extremely pleasant and efficient and she very kindly upgraded our room for us.  The room was a good size, with a very well presented bathroom.  The bar and restaurant is first class, whilst other public areas of the hotel could be described as a little tired, this will not spoil your stay at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel.  I did find it a little quirky that I had to ask the concierge for the key to the public bathroom located in the basement?  Overall I would highly recommend a stay in this hotel.;4
We arrived early on a train from DC. I went to have our luggage stored & was told our room  was ready. We were pleasantly surprise to have a corner suite. There was a great view and I had a lovely visit with my daughter. It was a comfortable place to come back to after  busy days!;5
This was our first visit to New York and we stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel on 8th Avenue, upper Manhattan. Very pleased with the hotel and it’s location is ideal for easy walking distance to many attractions and good restaurants. Mohammed on reception made us very welcome and upgraded us free of charge to a room on 37 floor which provided us with excellent views of the city and Hudson River. Great food from Tick Tock restaurant next door especially the breakfasts.  All in all a great hotel ideally located and would certainly use again.;4
Excellent hotel, maybe could do with a new carpet but he ho who cares about that, the staff are very friendly, the restaurants are first class, food is beautiful could not fault it, would definately stay in this hotel again and it was in an excellent location for the attractions;5
Stayed 3 nights for my first visit to New York and we had a great experience at the New Yorker. Perfect location if you are going to Madison Square Garden which can be seen from the New Yorker. Easy walk to Time Square and the theatre district. A bit of history Mohammed Ali stayed at the New Yorker after his fight with Joe Frazier. The history of the hotel is very interesting and can viewed next to the business center. While staying at the hotel our TV broke and within 2 hours we had a new TV not bad for a big 2400 room hotel.;5
The hotel was wonderful! I really enjoyed when I checked in, the lady was very kind and considerate. She got me another bed on request and greatly appreciated that. The room was beautiful and nice view for a good price. I really enjoyed the diner and the restaurant. The bartenders were wonderful and accommodating. It truly was a great experience and would highly recommend.;5
"Friendly, helpful staff.  24-hour diner OK; lunch-dinner trattoria quite good.  Luxurious elevator banks--6 for lower floors, 6 express for the upper floors--never much of a wait!  BUT---room was small, tho decently equipped; tripped switch on wall as we entered, and NO light from the main chandelier!  Glass wall (not the movable door) of shower leaked badly onto bathroom floor.  Desk contained small binder of ""helpful"" info, but following the instructions for the heating/cooling system, the system was quite inoperable; called for a maintenance person--he immediately got things up and running, using steps quite contrary to those in the binder.  I suspect every single room had one of those heretical binders to stymie the best atmospheric intentions of all the guests!";3
This was my sons and my first trip to New York. The staff was great, the room and view was amazing. Special thanks to Kader, and Jennifer at concierge desk. Great advise on how to see so much in such short time, and where to get some great pizza. Cant wait to go back again, Thanks for making this a special trip for us.;5
"Dingy and dirty. In serious need of remodel. Tiny rooms. Barely room to walk by the beds.  Tiny desk.  Tiny closet.  Bath hot water alternated randomly between scalding and freezing.   Bed very uncomfortablle-like sleeping directly on box springs.  All in all, perhaps the worst non-budget hotels I have stayed in.  And frankly not as nice as a few Motel 6 I have been in.  NY hotels as a rule are pretty disappointing unless you spring for a REALLY expensive one, but this one was notably worse than others.  When I checked out, I was asked ""how was your stay"".  My reply was ""very disappointing.""  Her reply, ""Oh, I am sorry."".  Then on to the next thing.  No question about what was wrong. No offer of compensation.  No surprise.";2
Stayed at the Wyndham for 3 nights in mid March upon check in we were asked to pay a facilities fee of $29 dollars a night even though we had already prepaid for our room, when asked what this fee was for it was the use of the gym ( we don't use any gyms) the business centre ( did not need the business centre but however we still had to pay it. Our room was small and basic facing other high rise buildings but since we were out of it all day it didn't really make a difference. Room was clean but could do with updating as did the corridors.  Reception area was quite grand as were the bar areas nice. On checking out we asked to store our luggage for the morning and we were charged $2 dollars per case didn't think this was fair considering we were guests and already paid an extra;3
We stay here once a year, and have always enjoyed it. Great location, wonderful staff, iconic history. It's a gem, I think. She may show her age in spots, but that's part of the enduring charm of an historic hotel. We love the Tick Tock Diner, the proximity to subway, Broadway and Macy's. Walking distance to many cool spots.;4
My check in was delayed 2 and a half hours because the hotel did not have enough rooms ready. This made me late for the event at MSG I was attending. The room was small but what you would expect in a NYC hotel. The view from the room was average. The only positive thing about my experience here was that it is in a great location.;1
This is a huge hotel that dates back to the 1930s. It is clean and friendly. The suites are so large that some have a dining room table for 6. The pull out sofa beds are surprisingly comfortable. The Tick Tock Diner in the lobby has a fun menu. The hotel is easily accessible by train from Newark and JFK. We always stay at the New Yorker for family weekend getaways.;5
Super original hotel right in the middle of everything.  Subway outside and Times square and all sights within walking distance. Friendly and welcoming staff made it a great place to come back to after a busy day.  Tick tock diner was a great place to start the day with breakfast. We didn't get to use all the facilities but all looked fine.  Historic gem in busy New York with staff who made you feel at home. Thanks for a great stay.;5
"Staying at the New Yorker Hotel is a New York experience.  It is not the most well know Hotel in Manhattan because of it age and history, it's because it is just plain endearing.  Every room as a view and a storey to tell.  This Wyndham is classically  clothed in the original unaltered Art Deco style.  Once you've discovered the mystique  you will return and return for more of its style.  My most current stay profoundly impressed on to me, the quality of the army of fine people that run this Hotel. This is  one of the world's most unique stops.  It starts at the front door with the livery of distinctly dressed Door-men and Bellmen that keep the doors spinning.  The Check-In desk is so efficient, your head will swim.  It's not the ""Welcome Back"" they say and mean it, It's their";5
So this is my third trip to NYC in as many years but my first stay at the the New Yorker. First impression when we walked in was that it looked nice, its very central for most things, times square is only  a minute walk away, with Macys just around the corner and MSG across the road, its also right across from Penn Station which is ideal for the subway. Wasnt overly impressed with the hotel room, was very small and basic with a lovely draft coming under the bathroom door. We used the Bianca bar a few times, not a bad wee bar, has a happy hour from 12:30 lunch time until 6:30pm. I found it best to sit and get table service if you wanted a drink as the bar staff tended to go MIA in the afternoon. We used tick tock diner for our breakfast every morning, mo complaints, breakfast was;3
First Mohammed took very good care of me, since I screwed up my reservations and saved my stay in New York city. Mohammed showed the concerned attitude expected from the front desk and exceeded my expectations. Also, Gabine was extemely helpful when I needed to extend my stay one night in a full house and came thru. So, this was my second stay at the New Yorker and will be where I will return to in the future.;5
A good price for a perfect location. Staff are courteous and pleasant. Though the room is not as big as shown in the picture, bathroom is small and has no bathtub. No breakfast included. But overall it is good if you’re not really expecting a luxurious place to stay;3
My partner and I stayed here over the St Paddy's weekend and It was great.  Our check in experience with Mohammad was great nothing was too much. His service was second to none. Just so you know the there is a service charge of $23 per room per night and they request a Credit card for a deposit of $100. This was returned to my credit card by the time we returned back to the UK.  Our room was on the 20th floor room 2040 it had not been renovated however had a great View of the Empire state building and was clean and big enough for us not to trip over each other. The bathrooms were a little small and in need of updating but not really an issue for us.  We ate a couple of times in Tick Tock and found it to be good value for money. Great Portions and staff were pleasant enough;5
Traveled to NYC with a couple friends. We found this motel on booking.com. The staff was very friendly! The security was very good! The room was nice . I loved that there was a sitting area with 2 chairs and a coffee table. Allowed us to play cards while staying in the evening of the nor'easter. Other reviews complained about the tiny bathroom. Tiny it was but clean! Also there were complaints about the closet but in our room with 2 double beds we had 2 closets! We were very satisfied!;5
The perfect location for a very good hotel. It as everything you need to be at NYC: awesome view, a little bit of history, remodeled rooms and a staff whom made me feel like I was getting home after a tough work day. ¡Thank you so much!;5
After turning up a day late due to a snowstorm and traveling for 23 hours. We were tired and weary to say the least. The hotel reception staff were great, they upgraded our room to a room at the front of the building and sent a bottle of wine up to our roof. It was a lovely welcome. We slept so well, one of the most cosiest beds I have slept upon. The location is fantastic two minute walk to Macy, five minutes to Central Time Square.  If using the hop on hop off bus it's located two minutes away opposite Macy's.  When we return we will be returning to this hotel. Not the most beautiful hotel as in bathroom but it makes up in friendly staff,cosy beds and great location;5
We stayed from Wednesday-Saturday.  The hotel is located perfectly within walking distance to penn station, mega bus stop, Times Square, MSG, Central Park, and we even walked down to battery park and back. There are so many cute neighborhoods we discovered by walking. We didn’t have to take one taxi the whole trip.  We did walk a lot, but enjoyed every second of it!    The staff was very friendly and the rooms were small yet updated and clean. We arrived at the hotel around 7am (check in is at 4).  The lady at the front desk was very accommodating and allowed us to check in at 7am for no extra cost.  We were also able to check our bags at checkout so we could enjoy the city prior to our late night bus. I would definitely stay here again!;5
Very tiny room but this is what you expect in NYC.  A surprise fee of $ 63 was charged at the check in for two nights.  Good location very close to subway.  Close to high line park.  Parking is expensive in this area so look for deals on the net before leaving.  We used spothero and found a great deal for three days parking.  Can leave the baggage at the hotel for $2 per bag.;4
1930 Art Deco hotel. Clean, comfortable room. Great location to activities or transportation. Reasonably priced for a large city grand hotel.All the NYS and NYC taxes were a bit of a surprise. Friendly staff. I have never had a bad experience here and I plan to return.;5
I had concert tix at MSG for 3/21 with an impending Nor'Easter.  The New Yorker hooked us up with a room last minute!  Every one of the staff there was friendly and accommodating.  Our concert was cancelled and they agreed to refund my 2nd night's stay and we headed back to New Jersey.  This hotel will now be my 'go to' when staying overnight in NYC.  The rooms may be a tad small but they're clean and who needs alot of space when all you do is sleep??!!  Added bonus is the Tick Tock Diner attached to the hotel....great food!!;5
We stayed here for 5 nights with a change of room since we had a gap of a day. The first room we had was on the 22nd floor and was quite cramped while the second one on the 25th floor was very spacious with 2 bathrooms. Both the rooms had no real views. The first room was quite noisy during the night while the othe one was really quiet. Both the rooms were very clean and so were the bathrooms. The beds were spotlessly clean and there were reasonable amount of toiletries in the bathroom. A coffee machine is not there by default and you are provided one if you ask for it. One thing which we found weird was the fact that the bathrooms cant be locked from inside. The insulation around the windows is suspect and some cold wind keeps leaking in but the room is heated so it wasn’t a;4
Myself and a friend stayed here 8th through to 12th March.  First time at this hotel but not NYC.  Had read many reviews of great location and helpful staff.  Emily and Mohammed had been praised.  Our TA made an error with our booking when we had thought we booked a double double (twin beds) but they had only booked a classic double.  We had been advised before our trip that we had received a free upgrade to a room with a view, and this was when the error had been noticed.  I contacted the hotel and liaised with Emily.  She was very helpful and agreed to upgrade us to a double double for a fee, which we were happy to pay and had discussed in advance.  Moving onto arrival where Mohammed checked us in.  I advised of the error and my correspondence with Emily only to be berated and;4
Location was excellent - subway choices, penn station.  We walked to theatre each time and did subway to Met Opera and some galleries. The hotel itself is grand art deco but some of the carpets in the common areas on our floor need attention and replacing.  having the restaurant and tick tock diner on premises were a big plus. We tried to get a taxi one day but the bell boy was rude so we didnt.  However, the facilities fee was a rip off and con job. We were told about it after travelling 24 hours. We had paid up front for the room and arrived 8 pm ish. To be greeted with this facilities fee was a shock. We were told it was for wifi - which according to booking form was included and their website says the same thing.  But no authorisation for faciilities fee - no room.  And we;3
Only arrived yesterday 3 ladies 2 of us came to celebrate birthdays mine only 2 weeks ago.They really made our day upgraded to suite bottle of fizz and handwritten card saying happy birthday .The staff are wonderful can not do enough for you asked for a kettle and got a lovely coffee machine.We would definitely stay here again .;4
This hotel is very well placed for a trip to NY and if you manage to get a high floor room the views must be excellent  our room was on the 25th floor and over looked the city but not the Empire State building which we did hope for. so my advice would be to ask at checkin if you could go to a higher floor with the view you want before unpacking. The hotel is old and our room was very out of date and small but thats what you get for a cheaper hotel, we found out that some rooms have been updated but they seem to go to the returning flight crews that stay there regularly. Don't be put off from this hotel as its location was excellent for subway travelling around and some staff (not all) were very helpful. Tick Tock dinner attached to hotel made a great start to the day for;3
Me and my boyfriend stayed here in January. We had a distastef with our flight due to the freak weather in New York and ended up being diverted to Washington Virginia Airport and having no luggage for the duration of our stay. The location of the hotel was perfect for us, as we got the train from Washington straight to Penn station which is next door to the hotel. There were lots of shops within walking distance which made it easier for us to replace our lost clothes and the pharmacy opposite was useful for toiletries and medication. Staff were very friendly, polite and helpful. Room was great! Smaller than expected but not small! We had a view of an office block which was illuminated in the evening. Maid service was brilliant. The hotel is beautiful in the lobby. We didn’t eat;5
"With this hotel's history, I look upon it as being ""The Grande Dame"" of her day, yet she still remains a beacon in the heart of Manhattan, providing friendly staff, cleanliness, a safe atmosphere, convenience, great restaurants, just to name a few.  I hope to soon return and stay there again . . .";5
Arrived late at night due to delayed flight check in was very straight forward. The room as very basic needs probably a few special touches but other than that clean tidy. Staff friendly enough. I would recommend. Only thing that bothered me was on last day we had a 23.00 flight which meant hanging around as it was our last day we didn't fancy walking around til the time of our transport and just wanted to chill and as funds was low at this point staying in lobby and just chilling was ideal but we were.asked many time.when we were going as we paid 2 dollars to store our luggage with them to our taxi came and I didn't see what the problem was that was the only let as it made us feel uncomfortable;4
I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. I had a business meeting to go to and Mohammed was very accommodating in expediting my check in. Very nice and professional, he is a great asset to this hotel. Thank you very much.;3
Good art deco hotel.... but room small convenient though... Well protected by security guards who keep asking you for your room key in order to get access to your room. Busy hotel lobby... Some rooms face the Empire state building. Very convenient for Macy's shoppers... a good diner is downstairs.  Friendly staff and clean but a bit old....;3
Outstanding room art decor all though the hotel is lovely the beds are so comfy wanted to take home with me plus this hotel is central to loads to and see Times Square Empire State Building Central Park loads of restaurants the staff are so so kind. They would see I had the baby and offer water and they just couldn’t do enough we got upgraded in our room so there was more space as Oscar had just started to walk I can’t wait to come back The cleaning staff Work do hard it’s spotless in fact they all do there all so helpful thank you for making my holiday do special xx;5
Well the location of this hotel is absolutely amazing. Close to the subway station, across the road from Madison Square Garden, a 10 minute walk to Empire State Building, Macy’s, Times Square, the lot!   A super hotel with friendly and helpful staff.   I would most definitely stay in this hotel when back in NYC. A quality venue at a good price.;5
We stayed here from the 1st - 5th Dec, so the first weekend after the christmas lights were switched on. Therefore NY was very busy. The location is very good, right opposite Maddison Square Garden, with the Empire State Building at the end of the road, Macy's on the same street and Times Square around 10 mins walk. You can walk to pretty much anything around midtown. Easy to get to with Penn St Station nearby, where we got the train to and from JFK. You can also get the subway to 9/11 Memorial/Wall Street and Liberty Island Ferry. The interior of the hotel is not quite as grand as the pictures, but is quite nice, their is work ongoing and signs on several floors apologising for this, but a lot of levels are very tired looking. I think we had a refurbished room on the 23rd;3
Really good value for money. Good location, had everything we needed and everything else was within walking distance. Also right on 32st penn station which was really convenient! NY we will be back! Thank you;4
While this hotel room was nothing to write home about, the location was great, the in-room coffee maker was a nice touch, and everything functioned well.  The bed could be more comfortable and the TV could be a little better but, for the money and location, I would definitely stay again.;4
We stayed at this hotel for four nights and had a great time. The hotel is quite dated and the lobby always crowded with random people which was a little off putting. We also found our room to be small with very limited storage. However, our bed was comfy, we had a great shower and the location was perfect for us, making our stay in New York a memorable one. All the staff were friendly and efficient, particularly Mohammed who checked us in and the gentleman on the transportation desk who was extremely helpful. We would return.;4
We recently stayed here to celebrate a birthday and anniversary. We got an upgrade to a room with a view which was amazing . The hotel was perfect for where and what we needed. The room was great and with a nice bathroom . Staff were friendly and efficient and the complementary champagne was a lovely treat .;4
I was extremely pleased with my room. It was much bigger than I expected and more importantly it was quiet. Plus it is right next to the subway so you can get to anywhere with ease. And they have a 24-hour diner that attached to the hotel with great food. I also asked for a coffee maker in the room and they brought one at no additional charge!;5
As the title says location is wonderful. Penn station across the road. Ideal if you are flying into Newark.  Room was very disappointing. Room 3304. Tiny with the smallest queen bed.  It was also freezing cold unless you had the very loud very uncomfortable air con on. This would make the room unbearably stuffy.  Staff were very helpful.  We asked for an extra blanket which arrived within minutes. Sorry we did not ask the first night. Also got extra towels. Had an issue with the toilet and again janitor arrived in minutes.   Could do with a facelift. But can see that would cost millions.   Overall it’s location and friendly helpful staff make it a great choice for NY. And excellent value for money.;4
Things seemed OK, but I awoke with SEVERAL bedbug bites. I cannot begin to describe the nausea and disgust I felt when I realized I slept in an infested room, and that I was attacked by bedbugs. Never having had this experience before, I didn't quite realize why I was itching until after I checked out, or else I would have made a scene at the registration desk. I was TOTALLY grossed out, and may NEVER stay at a Wyndam hotel again because of this.;1
This hotel is old and very tired. There is a lot of deferred maintenance, and the rooms are not particularly clean or comfortable. My bed was old and squeaky. The claim to fame is that Nikola Tesla died there. I will give them this, I stayed on the 40th floor and the view was great and the elevators fast. Convenient to have 24x7 dining on-site. If remodeled this property could command a much higher price and much better reviews. All the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. If you like Art Deco, you might enjoy this time capsule.;2
The location is just great. Very beautiful building nearby Pens station, shopping area and Times Square. There is a great restaurant in the building that is open 7/7 24/24. I had a large cozy room at the 29th floor that was very quiet for being in NY. Very good bed. Free internet. And very friendly people helping you out.;5
I booked this holiday as a birthday present for my partner’s 30th.  Location was great. Across the road from Pens station. (Train from airport was so easy)  Got to hotel and during check in they noticed we were celebrating a birthday. The lady behind the desk upgraded our Queen only room to a suit on the top floor. Room 4004 was amazing. The view was out of this world. It was clean and we couldn’t have asked for anymore. There was always a lift available and reception was always helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to visit again.   Thank you for the best holiday ever.;5
We arrived late on Sunday night and received a very friendly greeting at reception, as we had emailed ahead we were given  an upgrade to celebrate our wedding anniversary , we stayed in suite 3810 on the corner with wonderful views of the city and the Hudson, the staff that we encountered were nothing but friendly and we even received a free bottle of champagne on our anniversary day a very nice gesture indeed. The New Yorker is close to most places including madison square gardens, Empire State and Times Square is a short walk away , port authority bus terminal is also a short 5 min walk away , subway station right across the road for easy access to all places. This hotel may need some tlc but it’s in a great location and reasonable priced for nyc, w also ate in the tick tock;4
Good Value historic Art Deco hotel near Penn Station & MSG. Location location location. This is a great spot a block away from Penn station and Madison Square garden. No businessmen to be seen but a popular, large travellers hotel.  Rooms on the small side but Clean with excellent bedding and mattresses in so called ‘executive rooms’.   Bathroom very compact but stall shower decent size with a great shower with great water pressure, at least on the seventh floor. Mohammed in guest services was fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for him to address. The hotel is a good value  with regular options south of $300 per night, all inclusive. Valet parking is $60 per night.;4
Good check in facilities but were given the wrong room initially..quickly rectified. We stayed on the 36th floor and had a great view of the Empire State Building. Nice room but the big let down was the bathroom ...SO SMALL. Nice reception are to relax in and very friendly staff who are only too happy with any requests.;4
Stayed here for 6 nights. On arrival the staff were very friendly. Booked in Quickly. We asked for tea & coffee facilities but that never turned up even thought she said we would get it. However we spent little time In our room more time exploring New York. Hotel was warm and clean. Yes a little tired but as long as it’s clean that’s most important to us. Bed was comfy. Shower was more of a jet of water but once used to it no problem at all. Easy to get the correct temperature for the water.  We would happily stay here again if exploring New York.;4
It really is only a stone's throw from Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station. The front desk service was excellent, everything was well prepared and ready for us for our late evening arrival. Loved the room with the views and layout (room 3020) The Tick-Tock dining associated is a disappointment though, see separate review.;5
My wife and myself come here every year to enjoy NYC. The hotel is very well situated to discover Manhattan. The rooms are very clean and the cleaning staff is very friendly. At the reception, look out for José Castillo. He understands what customer satisfaction is all about and I am sure he will continue making name for himself in the hotel business. If you are in NYC, I really recommend this hotel.;5
I stayed here between 1st and 6th March this year. Check in was smooth, no queues, my card was charged a facility fee of £163 which got refunded on check out and returned to my bank account within a few hours.   We were issued a key and shown which lift to use. We were on floor 24. There wasn’t a view just of another part of the hotel. A view would of been nice but wasn’t a big issue.  The room had a double bed, chest drawers and a table with a chair. Large wardrobe storage with a free safe, iron, ironing board, hairdryer. Plenty  of plugs. Bathroom had a shower over the bath. Air conditioning worked well and was nice and warm in the room.   The hotel is very central, a short walk to Times Square and most other places you can get to by using the subway across the road, Maddison;5
The biggest thing this hotel has going for it is the convenience - right in the middle of everything - and for us coming in to NYC by train, a stone's throw from Penn Station.  That's why we've chosen it twice in the last 10 years.  Checkin was a wait on a Saturday afternoon, but the front desk staff were very nice.  The room was very clean, but quite small.  The bathroom even tinier.  But it worked for one night with two people, and it was blessedly quiet on the 8th floor.  Checkout was easy the next morning too.  The only real complaint we had was that we had left our two bags with the storage dept. ($2/bag storage fee) as we had time for a quick museum tour before catching our train at noon.  When we returned to the hotel at 11:30 to pick them up we encountered a HUGE long;4
i arrived in my wheelchair after a 23 hour flight from South Africa via London. i was quickly ushered to a separate desk next to the check in counter. after a friendly easy check in, Mohamed stopped me before i went to my room and said he would like to upgrade me from a standard room to a bigger room in the new section on the 7th floor to give me more room for my wheelchair. Mohamed went the extra mile. the room had great space was clean and the bed comfortable. the location was central. With staff like Mohamed i will definitely use The New Yorker in the future.;3
Clean, conveniently located, excellent service, this hotel provides very good value for money, and my wife and I will be back.  The rooms on the 7th and 8th floors are the only ones, as far as I could gather, that have been completely renovated.  Rooms on the other floors can have very small bathrooms, and the living space can be quite small as well. No guarantee that requests can always be met, but it would never hurt  to request the 7th or 8th floor and to ask specifically for a larger room.  Our experience was that the staff was willing to go to some trouble to accommodate.;4
Mohammed was too kind to set us up right as soon as we walked in at noon. I will say the room is from an older design so don't expect any closet space or a large bathroom, but we weren't overly concerned about spending a lot of time there. The room was clean, but sink clogged a few times and faucet made a horrible noise when you first turned it on.  Otherwise, valets were wonderful and the $ was right for two nights. So worth the stay to walk to b shows, TS, and excellent eateries. Will stay again for sure.;4
We spent three nights in a room on the 38th floor with a beautiful skyline view that included the Empire State Building. When we asked for a room with a view and explained this was a trip to celebrate my birthday, the gentleman helping us sent a free bottle of wine up to the room with us. Security was great: all guests must show their room key before going up in the elevator. And the location was central to everything in Manhattan. Would definitely stay there again.;5
we where booked into this hotel for 2 nights on the way back from Washington. when we arrived reception was very busy with check ins but found we didn't have to wait long staff very helpful and friendly. We where told room wasn't quite ready and they where very sorry . but we could check in cases and leave with the porter just to come back and pick up key. We went out for lunch and when we came back we found that we had been upgraded from the upgrade that I booked to suite as it was for a special 65th birthday it was a very nice jester it was on the 48 floor and had great views.  Rooms Very clean  as was the hotel Good thing about the hotel is that if you don't show your pass you don't get into lifts to rooms.  we where told that the clocks in new York would go forward one hour;5
Stayed here for 6 nights mid March. On arrival there was a  small queue to check in but the lovely lady I think her name was Krystal sat at the Customer service desk called us over and checked us in. We had booked a queen view room, we were told that the room wouldn't be ready for about an hour but we could leave our cases in the storage area and go back in an hour. on our return the room was ready and we had been given vouchers for a complementary drink and breakfast as a thanks for waiting. Our room was on the 23rd floor with a view out over Maddison sq Garden, the room was a good size and was very clean and we loved the Art Deco features. our room was serviced every day and the towels changed on request everything worked well the shower was hot and powerful and for a change;5
To explore NY its a great hotel, if you come from JFK just need to take the LIRR and in 20 minutes your going to be in front of the hotel, its just crossing the street from penn station. You are going to have all the attractions at walking distance like Times Square, Madison Sq. Garden, Broadway, Macys and several others on 5th Avenue.   The rooms were spacious and big for NY area and the personal very friendly and you feel safe at this hotel because they have security at the elevators, if you don't have a key your not going to enter.   Fast free internet and I arrived early and they gave me the room so can't complain, its a great hotel;4
Loved the decor and feel of this hotel.  All staff we met were friendly and helpful.   Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable.  The beds were a bit on the small size for us but as we were only staying a few days it wasn’t an issue.   Really loved the shower, wish I could of taken it with me.   Only downside to our stay was that it was rather noisy in our room. It seemed as if a window was open and we could hear all the outside noise from the street. We checked but couldn’t find a window open so assume the windows are just not double glazed.  We were so tired though from our activities in Manhattan for the noise to really bother us or disturb our sleep.   Location wise was great for us, close enough to the places we wanted to visit for us to be able to walk.   I would;4
This hotel has a great location, Madison Square Garden is in front of it. Not in Times Square but you can walk 8 blocks . Plenty of restaurants around the hotel. A CVS is just across the street.  Although it needs some renovations , it is very clean. Rooms are a little small. We barely can’t walk in it. Bathroom has a good size . Check in was quick and customer service was great. Will stay again , good hotel.;3
Yes the rooms are small and the corridors could use updating, but that was part of the draw. It is the real deal. It's a classic art deco hotel with the Tic Tock Cafe and a block from Madison Square Garden! It had a better gym than most of the newer hotels I've stayed at.;4
I took my husband here for his 60th birthday and was upgraded to a suite which was really good, service good and room service was really good, really helpful. Cant fault staff or anything , only slight issues is it could do with a lick of paint but seeing your only in room to sleep cant see that much of a problem as everywere was clean and would definitely stay here again .;5
We stayed here for a weekend.  I was disappointed in the quality of the rooms, very old, and had an odor.  The shower changed from hot to cold every few seconds.  We got charged a facility fee for each person when we arrived which was not mentioned upon booking.  I had extra charges on my CC that I am still working to resolve.  Would not stay here again.;2
We've stayed sat this property before but this was the nicest room ever. Obviously renovated. The hotel couldn't have been more centrally located for the things we wanted to do. The only negative is the $29 facility fee which was not mentioned on my reservation. That's $29 per day! I think they should drop the price of the room by $30 and charge a $59 facility fee. Then it would be obvious that this is not ethical even though it's legal.  I've noted for my future reference that the Wyndham chain charges hidden fees.;4
My kids and I stayed here because of the close proximity to Madison Square Garden. The location was perfect! The staff was great and the room was very clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.;5
Stayed here for 1 night great location. lobby looks great so I thought rooms would be just as good.  How wrong can one be the corridors  Absolutely stink very musty they need a complete refresh & livening up the room I stayed in was small and in desperate need of modernising & again had that musty smell . Stop living of your past New Yorker hotel & embrace the 21st century.;3
Hotel with a lot of history in an excellent location across the road from Maddison Square Garden and close to Penn Station.  Many rooms are quite small and dark with tired decor but adequate.  Manhattan is noisy and the New Yorker can not fully escape this but the higher the room or one tucked away in the numerous alcoves (but less natural light) the better.  Reasonable gym in the basement.  Very busy with tourists.;4
Received a free up grade on arrival to a 2 queen bedded room with 2 bathrooms, ok view  on 19th floor., room was very spacious. I can't find a fAult with this Hotel. It has everything in room, TV , hairdryer , iron etc but the WiFi wasn't great. The WiFi in reception area was much better. On request a tea/coffee maker was delivered to room no charge.  Location was excellent, Penn Station just across the road along with Madison Square Gardens. Empire STate was a five minute walk on the way there you pass Macy's and KMart. Times Square was about 8/10 minute walk and on the way there you can pass Carlos Bakery. Loads of bars and delis around too. Will return.;5
Great staff and a clean hotel which is totally fit for purpose for a stay in New York. The rooms are the usual size for a double in your home which is fine. Location excellent for Time Square and the theatres.;4
New York we loved it there and I would go again and again we had 3 weeks there and done so much we had a car and drove down to Canada for a day trip we spent so much money on shopping you will never get bored there is so much to do;5
We have just returned home after staying for 4 nights. On arrival to the hotel we were able to check in quickly. Unfortunately they were not able to offer us an early check in but our room was upgraded to a room with an amazing view and complementary bottle of sparkling wine. We were able to leave our cases at the hotel until our room was ready. We were given a room on the 37th floor which had  2 queen beds and our view was exceptional. Looking straight out onto the empire state building. Our room was spotless, the bath room although a little tired was just as clean.  Art deco decorated throughout.  No tea/coffee facilities but we knew that and brought a kettle with us as we like our tea. There was lobby wifi which we were given the password on arrival. High speed internet that;5
We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel. It is an ideal base for Midtown attractions within walking ie the Empire State Building, Macy’s, Times Sq, Rockefeller Building, Sax on fifth. Bus or subway will get you to the downtown attractions such as 9/11 ground zero, Statue of Liberty, Wall St and more.  The hotel itself is steeped in history and remains faithful to that history with its decor.  In its basement there is a small museum outlining the hotels historic past.  Great place to stay.;4
Fabulous stay!!! My daughter and I travelled to New York for my 50th. We arrived to Newark airport and took the Air Train to the train station and took the train to Penn Station just a two minute walk to the Hotel and only £18 pounds for the two of us. Check in was quick and efficient, credit card required to put a $180 amount for resort fee and any other hotel expenses you may use but st the end of your stay you can choose to pay by cash instead of your credit card. We were disappointed with our room we were given initially. It was small only a double bed, very dark and a brick wall for a view. We went back to reception and upgraded to a double double room with a view an extra $25 dollars a night. The View from the room was amazing EMPIRE STATE BUILDING right before your eyes;5
We visited New York in December for the New Year Celebrations, I mean the trip was amazing hotel was great but weather was horrific. This hotel is in a great location, access to most places by foot you can walk everywhere. The rooms are small but big enough for luggage and a nights sleep. The service at the hotel was good as the staff are very vigilant and happy to help.;5
This hotel was so small and so uncomfortable I wS mad that I didn’t splurge and go to intercontinental. I will never be going back here;1
I have just stayed for 4 nights, 5 days at the hotel . Check in was very quick even though it was very busy . I had asked for an early check in but they were unable to do this as the hotel was very busy .We were told we would be given a room with a super view and a complimentary bottle of wine. The hotel stored our cases while we went for a wander. When we did get into our room 3717 the view took our breathe away .two beds , armchair, desk iron and ironing board,safe .The bathroom was a good size and everywhere was spotlessly clean with no less than 10 towels of assorted sizes. Plenty of hot water. Yes you do have to run hot water taps for a long time but the hotel is huge.you can smell the food from tick tock diner at times in corridor. I do not understand what people have to;5
Rooms can be small but when I had a couple of minor issues they moved me to a nicer room right away. 24-hour diner isn’t fancy and I would skip the “coffee” but sure is quick & convenient right on site or McDonalds is literally across the street. Good location by Madison Square Gardens & Penn Station and would stay there again :);3
We stayed here with our teenage sons for 4 nights and wish we didn’t. I wanted the old world New York charm, which The New Yorker definitely had however, the staff were not friendly or helpful at all. Upon check in at the members desk, the man didn’t look at us once and was kinda rude to us! Not a good start. I asked security about attractions and he swiftly sent me to the “come for a feee breakfast and no obligation to sign up” desk where it took me 20 mins to explain I didn’t want to do it and just wanted ideas where to go.  Not a great start to our holiday!;2
pon arrival we had to wait a few minutes as it was busy in reception, but that was fine. When we did check in we were told that we had been given an upgrade to our room and was given a room with a view. We were also given 2 vouchers for a free breakfast at the diner attached, the tick tock diner.This was because it was my birthday the day before we arrived. The room itself was lovely and cosy. Not verly big but hey we weren't there to stay in the room all day we were there to visit New York. The bathroom again was small but not really an issue. We did find a few hairs on the wall in the bathroom under the window but this is a minor fault and not necessarily the housekeepers problem as they could have been in the air after cleaning and just so happened to land on the wall. There;4
Just returned from a 3 night stay in New York. Upon arrival check in was super fast and within 10 minutes we were in our rooms. Rooms are small but beds are super comfy. Only thing with my room was the plug was the other side of the room to my bed so was a nightmare for charging my phone during the night. Shampoo and soap in bathroom but no shower gel which was disappointing. Location is amazing. 5 minute walk to Macy’s and 5th Avenue. The rest of the attractions are walkable or easy enough to jump on a tube. We ate breakfast in the diner next door on our first day and it was amazing. Unlimited coffee and the pancakes were MASSIVE! All in all we had a great wee stay and wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.;4
"My husband and I have just returned from a 5 night stay in the New Yorker hotel.  I had stayed before back in September 2011 with my son and had been wanting to return for some time.  I especially want to thank Mohammed on the front desk who upgraded us free of charge to a wonderful room with a view of the World Trade Centre, Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan.  We had room 3711 on the 37th floor.  The room was perfect for us.  The beds are very comfortable with new mattresses and comfortable pillows.  It was also very quiet so we got a good night's sleep.  Every morning we ate our breakfast in the Tick Tock Diner which was as good as I remember from my first visit.  I had my ""necessary"" 3 pancakes with butter and maple syrup.  It is open 24/7 and never closes but is always";5
Stayed at The New Yorker  had a lovely time staff very atttentive and friendly . When we arrived our room had been incorrectly  booked by our travel agent , the hotel was full but the following  day  the room requested was available  deluxe queen with view. And an excellent  view it was . Tick tock diner great food large portions , horel italian restaurant  also highly recommended  . We arrrived friday pm fror 3 nights. Hotel great location. Would definablely stay here again;5
My wife and I were stuck in NYC because of a storm that cancelled all trains to Long Island.  We needed somewhere to stay and the New Yorker was a great choice.  It was reasonably priced, clean, and very quiet.  It's not so bad to be stuck in the city overnight, so whether an emergency or you plan for it, The New Yorker is a great choice.;5
"Whilst this place is some way short of its Art Deco / post WW2 zenith these days, it is still an iconic hotel that retains more than a hint of its historical past.  These days it plays host to hoards of both national and international tourists as opposed to the ""jet set"", and many areas of the building are crying out for a refurb, but the rooms - for NYC anyway - are generously sized, it offers guests several eating & drinking options, and is ideally located for exploring the great metropolis of NYC, being no more than a stone's throw from Madison Square Garden and Penn subway/local commuter train station.  Apart from the ""need-to-refurbish"" issue, the other things that niggled were the poor fit of the hotel room windows, which was particularly unfortunate as the outside";3
My boyfriend and I stayed in a 39th floor suite to celebrate his birthday for 5 nights this month and it was incredible. The check in was smooth, staff were amazing (especially Samira!!) couldn’t have asked for a better experience. The views were to die for too! We will be back.;5
Great stay, hotel central and close for sight seeing. Upgraded to an executive room free of charge with all the extra you would expect from coffee machine to toiletries. Room made up and cleaned every day. Staff friendly and helpful.;4
We enjpyed the location of the facility to the goings on, we enjoyed the staff, and we were pleased with our stay.  We would definitely stay again.  We have stayed a few different places when going to New York city, and this was one of the most smooth stays.;4
The hotel lobby is lovely. That’s about as far as it goes. When we checked in the receptionist asked to see my card, I assumed just to confirm the card I booked with. No, she swiped it and whilst doing so told me they were taking a $100 deposit which I’d get back on checkout. If she explained this first I would have offered to pay this in cash considering I would now get an international card fee charge. When checking out they didn’t even mention the deposit. I asked and she told me it will go back onto my card. I asked for a receipt and she seemed confused as to why I would want a receipt and told me to call the bank if there was a problem with the money going back in 7-10 days. So they can take the money in a flash but it takes over a week to return it. I may not have even had;2
I highly recommend this place, they were completely helpful with me. The room is clean, dimensions are good, service is excellent. The hotel is well located also, just a few blocks from some of NY city foremost attractions, and two main subways stations around it.;5
Excellent location for everything. Can walk to pretty much everything from the hotel with Madison Square On your doorstop. Hotel clean and comfortable. My only slight moan would be that when we booked the room we were told that there was a large queen bed. But although I was staying with a  very good friend the bed was a small double and we had to pay $25 a night to upgrade to a room with 2 beds.The Tick Tock Diner was brilliant. The food was excellent and the staff were really friendly. Overall good value for miney;4
We arrived at the New Yorker mid afternoon after our flight was delayed, we checked in with no queue and was dealt with by a lovely man on reception who asked if we had any special requests to which my partner answered a suite would be nice as we are celebrating a 50th Birthday jokingly and to our surprise and amazement he went away for a couple of minutes then came back with a lovely bottle of wine and told us we now had a suite. Our room was amazing, it was on the 30th floor with one of our windows directly opposite the Empire State Building. Our room had a separate lounge, bedroom with en suite wet room and a kitchen area with a coffee machine. The room was cleaned daily to a high standard and coffee etc replaced everyday. We also had free WiFi. The staff at this hotel are;5
"They don't know who I am. They treated me with respect. They accommodated my needs. They never asked questions and  when I requested a ""Late Stay"" they said ""SURE"". Thank YOU to the Wyndham NEW YORKER for making my stay memorable. Anonymous";5
Its old and dated , stayed there last week for 10 days. the facilities are poor. Looks Grand but its still in the 30s. Maybe thats where it wants to be.  The beds were comfortable and clean.  But watch your Credit card they swipe at the front desk. mine was charged twice I caught it on the second day and after some discussion with the desk staff it was  removed from my account. They don't take it it just stays pending but then that limits your card. No restaurant per say just an expensive dinner tagged on to the  front Lobby of the hotel . Fine if you want to spend $50 dollars plus tips for 2 for breakfast>>>>>> . No water or mini bar fridges in the room as you normally expect. I travel all over the world and this must be one of the most basic hotels I have stayed in a long;2
New Yorker hotel was fantastic we stayed for 4 nights 5 days brilliant  location the cafe on the corner  of the hotel  was lovely mac donalds over the road everything about new York was amazing  I can't  wait to go back we want to go to see the white house;5
I traveled in February 2018 for music lessons in NYC. I made a reservation with the help of Kelvin Diaz who was wonderful with communication and in getting me booked. Upon arrival, Mark Johnson and staff went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable including relocating me to a quieter room with a superb view. Thanks to both of these gentlemen and the rest of the staff members.;5
This was my second stay at the New Yorker. Its midtown location is convenient to the rest of the city. Many subway lines are within a short walk from the hotel. If you travel by train, the hotel is two quick blocks from Penn Station.;4
My wife booked this trip to celebrate our 50th birthday. On letting the hotel know this they arranged a complimentary upgrade.  So, first impressions, beautiful Art Deco foyer, loads of staff and no waiting to book in. We were early to book in so our room wasn’t ready. Staff couldn’t have been more apologetic but assured us it was a really good room so worth the wait. Checked the luggage in, went out for a couple of hours and came back. Turns out the previous occupant had only just booked out so the room still wasn’t ready.  Again, staff could not have been anymore helpful. The gentleman on the reception nips away. Speaks to his manager, comes back with a complimentary bottle of champagne and an upgrade to a suite on the 39th floor with a view of the Empire State Building. (Bear;5
Nice hotel, friendly helpful staff. Good location for sure, classic old hotel with a lot of history and class. Only thing that bugs me is the mandatory accessory fee all the NY hotels charge at checkin, adds 25-30 dollars, don't recall exactly how much.;5
Stayed here with my boyfriend for a week in May 2017 and we had a great stay. The location is perfect for sightseeing with Madison square garden right outside. We booked a small suite which had amazing views of Manhattan and New Jersey and have us plenty of space to relax after long days exploring the city. Tick Tock diner is great for a snack and is part of the hotel and the the other restaurant does great food and cocktails. Would love to go back.;5
The New Yorker hotel is a great location. The room was attractive, clean, and comfortable including the beds and sofa bed. The staff was courteous and maid service was excelkent. excellent.;5
Nice friendly staff, spacious rooms and convenient location. The elevators are a little slow but otherwise a nice surprise for a classic older hotel.;5
Printer didnt work in office room,quoted nearly double for hop on hop off bus tour from concierge desk compared to doing a research. Wouldn't bother with so called American breakfast,we had to argue to get cereal and ended up with two cardboard boxes. Management seemed overwhelmed when i raised some of these issues. Hotel is handy to subway,many tourist attractions. But in the end you do get what you pay for.;2
Can anyone help me to find a shop In midtown that sells some backwoods and swisher sweet please as I love cigars and have always wanted to try them and am not to sure where to find any shops I have looked everywhere for one thanks 😊😊;5
The New Yorker was built in 1928 so the. Art deco feel is apparent. The thing that sets this hotel apart from other mid town Manhatten hotels is  the customer service.  Mohammed checked us in early and upgraded us to a window view , larger room. The $45.00 a night added charge for incidentals  is small compared to the quality , and additional amenities. Mohammed definitely provided exemplary customer service;5
New Yorker hotel is a beautiful deco building and very central for 42nd street, Times Square, Empire State Building, Macy’s and Maddison Square gardens. Staff were very helpful, rooms clean but a little small for  2 adults and all our luggage. There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel and the subway is on the next block.  We choose to walk up to Central Park and grand central station which was a lovely trip and an interesting walk. There are plenty of taxis around but the traffic is heavy as you would expect from a city centre. It is a good location for walking from.    Only issues I had were that the room safe didn’t work and was not fixed in the 3 days I was there. And the hotel was hosting a large dog show at the time- ok if you like dogs. I found having dogs in;3
This is the 3rd year in a row that we had stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker. This time the room was not as clean as it usually is, the bathroom was very run down, and with my two little kids with me, it leads me to think I will not be coming back. Very disappointing since I love the location and that it is attached to several restaurants.;4
Hotel lobby feels like a hostel or train station. No ambience and always busy. Charged a facility fee for Wi-fi that wasn’t clear in online booking. Charged for storing bags after checkout. First time ever for me!  Corridor to room stank. Room narrow and lacking any charm and tiny bathroom with nowhere to put anything. Tick tick diner for breakfast, surly staff.  Good location for subway, Times Square and high line were the only good things.;2
Stayed here twice in February and feel I have different views on both stays. The first stay at the hotel was uneventful. Our room on the 33rd floor was on the small side, but clean and comfortable. The second stay was somewhat different. We had a room on the 22nd floor and was similar to our first stay. Unfortunately on our last night we returned to our room having been out sightseeing all day to find that our room had not been seen by housekeeping. We thought that they perhaps were just running late so changed for dinner and left the hotel. On our return at 9.30pm, we realised that housekeeping had overlooked our room so we phoned them to advise them of this . A chambermaid was despatched and our bed was made and fresh towels were given. Not entirely satisfactory, but just;3
Hi all we have recently stayed at the New Yorker , The hotel has character and charm reminding you of a old 20s themed hotel from a movie , check in - was ok , Mohammed was very helpful as we arrived an hour before check in - BE WARNED AS IT IS A JOKE THE NICE MANDATORY FACILITY FEE! - Facility fee which includes- WIFI which is fine as yes is nice to have WiFi whilst away but this also covers USE OF THE GYM! Gym why do i want to go to the GYM whilst i am on holiday if i would like to use the gym there should be a fee for this service , i can also in my 31.75$ per day use the buisness centre to print and use the computers which I DID NOT AND DO NOT NEED TO USE whilst on holiday! So basically I paid 31.75$ to use the WIFI which is very expensive WiFi , Wyndham are laughing at all;3
Loved the character and old charm of the hotel. Clean, staff was professional and helpful with area information. Bathroom was small, and towel rack needs to be removed from behind door/close to toilet. Every time we went to use the restroom, would hit our heads on the towel rack getting up from toilet and the door could not open all the way because of the towel rack. This was just in the basic room, may be different in larger rooms.;4
I read on here that the hotel was tired and dated so was a bit apprehensive BUT on arrival it was lovely, a big lobby and no queue to check in which had also been a complaint.  When we got to our room the decor was all Art Deco even down to the taps for the shower, bath and sink.  The bed was big and comfortable and it was very very clean with housekeeping every day and the option to have the sheets changed everyday if you wanted.  There was a safe in the room and a tv, hairdryer, iron, ironing board.  Staff were very nice, friendly and helpful and I can find nothing to complain about.  This hotel s rated 3 star and it certainly met standards.;5
We had a great time staying in this Hotel,, staff where wonderful on check in, really looking after us. Cant say enough about them really.  The hotel is in a brilliant location, few minutes walk to Times square and the Empire state building,,,Highline also only a walk,,, Buses are going by in all directions and Penn station is right below the hotel where you can get the E subway to JFK and also downtown. There is also an excellent shopping district one block away around 6th and 34th.  In general I wouldn't expect too much from the rooms,,they're fine. Basic and clean but to be honest you're out so much it doesn't take anything away from the experience. I would highly recommend staying here especially if its your first time to NYC..;4
I've been to NYC a few times now and I still return to the New Yorker as my Hotel of choice.  At it's price point it gives everything you might need for a comfortable holiday.  Whilst the first room we were allocated was a tad small for more than a week stay, I asked to be moved to a larger room and there was no fuss or issue at all.    For me, a significant plus point of this Hotel is its location.  Many people worry about transport and directions, and in my opinion can get 'guided' unnecessarily into using taxi's when really there is no need.  They will often be slower and certainly more expensive than trains or subway.  Arriving from Newark Airport by train was really simple (as was the return),  and the daily use of the Subway system is all part of the New York experience.;5
Went for a long weekend, shout out to Mohammad, for the free upgrade to a suite and complementary bottle of wine, for my birthday!! Staff was awesome, room was very clean, great location. Will def be returning!;5
Stayed here for four nights, location is great, 2 minutes walk from Penn station which makes getting to JFK airport a breeze. 10-15 minutes walk to Times Square and The Empire State building. Rooms are well cleaned and beds are comfy. Tick Tick diner is well worth a visit.;4
Stayed at the New Yorker for one week Check in was friendly and efficient the excellent  customer service we received by Sharmayne and Mohammed,  we requested a high floor for views to celebrate our 30 th wedding Anniversary, and had to  wait one day for the room to be available, A 30th floor newly refurbished room and corridors .   our first allocated room was 19th floor with dull dreary corridors and it was small and quite cold draught from the Windows but with manual air con,,  but nice and clean  ,it could have done with a thick duvet and not just thin sheets but we were only in this room for our first night and then upgraded to the 30 th floor Room 3038 had a balcony/ roof terrace we did not use as the door was locked ,, It would be lovely to use in the warmer months,😃,;3
Arrived at the New Yorker via the train from Newark. A short walk from Penn station. Quick to get checked in. We didn’t have to pay resort fees as they are running a promotion in Feb and March. We also only paid $100 cash deposit without a problem, we don’t have a credit card.  We got an upgraded room on the 8th floor. No view and only a small window but it was a lovely room. Comfortable bed. Decent clean bathroom. Air conditioning and a perfectly fine tv.  WiFi worked well in the room.  Didn’t use the tick tick diner or the bar attached to the hotel but they looked busy whenever we went past.  Check out was quick and easy.  A nice big and busy lobby. Always plenty members of staff around. Felt very safe here. Concierge helped us with our return to the airport. All in all a;5
Myself and Husband just arrived back from The Wyndham New Yorker on 22nd Febriuary 2018. The hotel has everything you need to enjoy the hustle and bustle of NYC and is so very central. All the staff were curteous and polite and extremely helpful with any questions or queries we had. We used the Tick Tock Diner once during our stay as theres so many great places to try and the food was delightful. Hotel has some amazing Art Deco decor, and our room on the 26th floor was small but yet comfortable and functional. Were already planning another trip to NYC and would cetrailnly stay at The Wyndham New Yorker again.;5
The staff at the hotel were helpful and welcoming. A special shout-out to Mohammed at the front desk who checked us in for his friendly demeanour, great service and helpfulness.  The room was clean and good sized (for New York), but lacked soundproofing. The bathroom has virtually no shelf space. The furniture, especially the bed, has seen better days and was noisy just tossing and turning.  On Check-out, we also had the surprise to learn that facility fees were charged per day, instead of for the duration of the stay, despite us not using any of the amenities. Worse though was the baggage stocking fee on the day of departure, which just seems greedy after I've just spent hundreds of dollars in that hotel.;3
If you want a budget hotel in a great location, you could do worse... I think. You are right in the middle of everything. Rooms are sub par. Dated fixtures, furniture and bathrooms. Rooms are small, even by NYC standards. Better value hotels nearby.;2
My wife and I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Wyndham New Yorker. We arrived at the hotel at 3pm and our room wasn't ready, however, the hotel does state that check in is at 4pm. The lobby was very full and all seats were taken by people waiting for their transfer pick up so we checked our bags and popped into the Tick Tock diner which is accessible from inside the hotel. Our room was ready at 4pm so we grabbed our bags and headed up to the 19th floor. The elevators are very quick and there are 6 available for floors 1-20 and another 6 for the remainder of the floors.  We paid for a metro view room and that is what we got. I was a little surprised with how small the room was but we sent plan on spending much time there so that wasn't an issue. There was an alarm clock;5
Where do i start ? 1st easy to reach from penn station. 2nd reception staff were fantastic. 3rd room was really clean and view was brilliant. 4th location for most attractions was brilliant. 5th all the staff were brilliant and thank you all for a memorable 1st visit to new york hope to see you all again soon;5
Hotel is fine for a city stay.   Lobby and hotel itself is well maintained. Breakfast was good. Staff are friendly enough.   Our room was very small though. It been manhattan but it was smaller then usual.  As I said staff where fine not over excited to see you but pleasant! Location is great very central to shopping area and central park. Fine for a city brake no complaints!;4
Close to all amenities [ bus pick up points, times square, shops ]. Rooms were a bit small & you can hear water running in rooms next door. After a long day at Niagara Falls the next morning we were woken up by a hammer drill outside our room. Maintance was going on right outside our room windows. We gave it 30mins but then had enough. Rang reception & they said they would do a room swap today [ but we still needed to leave today & a room would be ready later ]. When we returned [3pm ] NO room was ready & at this point my wife lost it. She made a scene at reception & they gave us one room to look at [so small you couldn't fit your suitcase [opened] around the bed. They then gave us a twin double bed room [beds small so we sleeped in separate beds] & we then had to pack up again;2
Hotel is located well. Its clean and service is friendly. The doors of the rooms are thin, so youll hear everything from the corridors. Its a bit worndown, but nostalgic in a way. Everytime you go to the elevators you have to show your key to the doorman. Restaurants are good. Walking distance almost everywhere and subway station near. Overall good.;4
Located right in the heart of NYC, and steps away from Penn Station and right in front of  Macys, this hotel is a very good option to stay. Great view of the Empire State building! You can walk to a lot of places and you can find coffee shops and restaurants in walking distance.;4
It's hard to write a review on property that is set in a very over priced city.   Here's all the postives: The room was clean and housekeeping was very timely. Very dog friendly. I was there for the Westminster Dog Show and it was quite convenient. Location was very good for all the touristy things as well. We could walk to many iconic sites. Check in and check out very easy.  Now for the negatives:  Even though I'm trying not to let price affect my feelings about the place it does play a part. As the rooms are  super tiny. Not much bigger than a nice size walk in closet. TV channels not working and would go in and out, not that I was watching much tv, but it's nice at the end of a busy day to watch a show.   If I'd pay $100/night it would get a 4 or 5 star but paying over;3
We were given a late checkout of 2pm complimentary which was much appreciated except on the day we were leaving the house keepers and cleaners moved into our room and completely stripped our room whilst we were at breakfast. They argued that they thought we had checked out despite the fact 2 suitcases, our passports and my straigtners were still in the room. I had also left my £279 michael kors watch in the bathroom which was gone. The management did nothing, we were made to leave the room at 10.45am and I did not get my watch back. Anyone staying here just beware of your valuables, do not trust the house keepers and cleaners!;1
I always stay at the the New Yorker and this time continued to live up to its expectations. Great service. Nice room. and it close to everything that I needed. a few block away from times square and in the heart of Manhattan. I will be staying her  again in a few months.;5
This hotel is in a great location,  but, there was only one plug socket in the bathroom above the wash hand basin to charge your electronic items - not at all safe. I could hear someone singing in the bathroom next door to me & thought someone was knocking at my door, when in fact it was for the room next door.;2
I know it's New York but really miserable front desk staff in this age are unacceptable. No attempt at conversation, a greeting or even eye contact. Upon arrival to getting to my room the only person who smiled was the security member before the elevators. Check out was no better sadly. The room was ok, large with a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. This is an old hotel so expect draughts from the windows, however everything in the room functioned correctly and the bed was comfortable. No tea and coffee maker in the room was another let down, so I went across the road to the French cafe, only to find this had closed down. McDonald's was next door and saved the day! Beware though this area has gone downhill, take care of your personal safety, there are many;2
A historical and old hotel with the standard charm of the 1930's (and the hallways will instantly remind you of the Shining!). We stayed on the 25th floor. Rooms were considerably larger than expected and clearly requiring substantial maintenance. Comfortable and clean nonetheless. Bathtub was shallow but water pressure and shower head was excellent. Taps are old so even the smallest nudge will either scald or freeze you - pick the setting and do NOT touch the taps lol. Check-in/out was fast and easy and the staff at that desk (on the right as you enter) were pleasant and helpful.  The cleaning staff were very nice and rooms were cleaned daily.  Location is good, DO NOT go to the McDonalds across the street unless you are comfortable with individuals who have untreated;3
I have been a repeat customer of the New Yorker for years and never had a back problem prior.  This year the mattress was way too soft and I could barely get dressed and/or walk after my first night sleeping on my back.  Unfortunately I did not realize the cause until I got home.  If I had I would have hoped they had a bed board available.  Other than this setback, I found the restaurant and Tick Tock Diner very good and with efficient workers.;4
"We were in NYC for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show as spectators, but lots of friends with dogs stayed here too. Room was wonderful - exceptionally clean and plenty of room - not teeny tiny like we thought it would be. We didn't have a great ""view"", but we were only there to sleep - too many other things to do! Very friendly and helpful staff. Close to Madison Square Garden, the subway, plenty of restaurants in the vicinity, and two drugstores next door in case you forgot something.  Both the Trattoria Bianca and Tick Tock Restaurants attached to the hotel were good.  The rates were high compared to what they usually are this time of year, but that's typical with a big event going on.  Hope to be back someday!!";5
Okay, all New York hotels are small - i get it! However, when you can't get in the room and walk around once you've got your suitcase in the room you start to wonder if you've made the right choice. The one thing I will say about this hotel is that it is original, as in, it hasn't changed since the 1920s. Which is amazing really. The layout hasn't changed,  it has been repainted - even the tiles in the bathroom (weird) and it still has all the original features. Were they much smaller years ago?? Possibly but for today's average couple, you'd be hard pressed to do the exercises you promised to do on New Year's Eve to lose those extra few pounds!! Anyway, the location is good - quite central and all within easy walking distance of the main attractions. Price wise - okay. Food;3
Room was clean, nice...but a bit noisy from street traffic. Retrieving car via text was frustrating, but worked out due to great help from front desk staff. Left an item in room on check-out....recovered due to extra effort by Rosie of Housekeeping! Overall, a good experience.;4
"The hotel's good location is the only thing going for this place. I requested for a room with a decent view and I was assured that I was given one; but when I entered my room it had the worst view. The front desk operates like a train station; the staff is least bit interested in talking to you; they sometimes even appear disgusted when you approach them. Flimsy plastic cups in the room! 1 accessible charging point in the entire room (however they added a time clock with charging on my last night). Who charges for keeping bags (30 mins) after checkout? Overall a very bad experience; completely avoidable.";1
Location is excellent. The staff are very professional and personable. Everyone from the front desk, housekeeping , security , and bellmen are simply amazing.  Shuttles to the Westminster dog show were great . Wish there was bathing for dogs like the penn. The cost to potty dogs was very Hugh considering there was no bathing and we had to pay a lot for that at the Penn.  This hotel is stylish and rooms are kept very clean. Staff appreciate your business. It is an extremely well managed hotel. Our double bed room was on the end corner and very large , our other room with king was beautiful as well but tight on space. Highly recommend this hotel.  Also, both restaurants on site were also good food with great stafff.  Trip advisor site not working for rating for sleep quality etc.;5
Stayed for 4 nights lovely hotel very welcoming. Lovely staff hotel very clean and warm every night I slept Iike a baby didn't hear a sound from outside. Great location for getting around the city. Will definitely be back.;5
Myself and my husband stayed here for 3 nights after a week at Iceland. When we got there after our long trip at 8pm they advised us that our room wasn’t ready and we had to stay in a different room without a view that we requested. To make up for this to be fair to them they gave us free breakfast vouchers for the next morning. The next two nights we were given a room with a fantastic view of the Empire State. The only drawback I would say is the rooms could have been cleaned better as there was a lot of dust in the bathroom.;3
I have stayed in other hotels for the Westminster dog show, but this was by far the best. Dog friendly, responsive staff, conveniently located to all our show venues, clean, comfortable, reasonable rates, and friendly.  Will go back!;5
"I was fortunate to be able to attend the Westminster Dog Show a week ago. Also lucky to stay at the New Yorker Hotel. It is very centrally located, and perfect for functions at Madison Square Garden. There were many dogs staying at the hotel. That was the fun part, seeing them. But the place was clean as a whistle and in a week's time I heard a dog bark only once. Very quiet. We had the choice of two bathrooms or a view. Having two bathrooms was a godsend. Lovely to have the choice. There was no evidence that there were many animals in the hotel. The dogs were pottied in the basement. Exceptionally clean hotel with excellent security. The ""Tick Tock"" diner is connected for easy breakfasts and the hotel has two restaurants, one Italian and the other a Steak house. Both good. But";5
Good location. My second time staying during the  Westminster dog show. Good with having show dogs as the basement is converted into dog area. Room was fine- good size and clean. What I didn't appreciate was waiting for 2 hours in the lobby for the room to be ready!;3
We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Wyndham. It really is a great hotel. We caught the train from JFK and arived at Penn Station to find the hotel conveniently locaed cross the street. The check in was smooth, quick and the staff were extremely friendly & polite. We were on the 29th floor and although we didn't get a view of the Empire State Building, the view we had was great. The room was a little smaller than we expected for the States and found we had to climb over the beds to get around if someone was sat at the desk. The beds were comfortable and we slept very well. The ony slight criticism I would make is that the bathrooms could do with a major overhaul. I never got the temperature in the the shower right the whole time I was there, it was either scalding;5
Very easy check in on a Saturday afternoon. Room was clean and warm. The New Yorker is an older hotel that was refurbished a few years ago. It’s nice nothing fancy. The tic tock diner is always open and has decent food. The bar in the lobby has good cocktails and better food. The location of the hotel is great if your at the Garden and a short walk to Times Square. I would recommend this hotel;4
Convenient location and ok price. This was a perfect location for a short weekend in the city. All of the conveniences including restaurants, transportation (near Vamoose dropoff and pick up), and entertainment were nearby.   The staff was pleasant. We did have a little hiccup with the check in, which we did not quite understand, but it was quickly resolved. Something about third party charges are handled. Our room was available several hours before check in.  The checkout was easy and it costs $2 per bag if you want to check your bags in and walk around before leaving the city. We had three bags and they charged $3 to drop off and $3 upon retrieval.  The room was very cozy (small) and the heating was not the best. The shower was dated, but forceful and pleasantly hot.  We;4
"For those traveling with a dog this really is the best place to stay. They have a dedicated area for dogs to potty that is kept immaculately clean, plus a “Jog a Dog Treadmill” to keep your dog(s) is top condition. The hotel is central to shopping & dining, or if you just don’t feel up to leaving a 2; hr diner is conveniently located within the hotel. The staff are courteous, kind & accommodating to ensure your stay is perfect. I had a great corner room with a view, I couldn’t have been more comfortable. This is my 2nd time staying here and it won’t be my last.";4
Upgraded to a room with a view upon arrival without us even asking which is nice.  Room was small but comfortable and had all the working essentials. We was on floor 35. Great location near the penn station subway, walk away from time square. Plenty of nearby restaurants etc.   Tip. It's better to be higher to see a view and to drown out the city noise.;5
Customer service is A+++++.  Great location near Madison Square Garden and Time Square.  Tick Tock restaurant in hotel is very nice and convenient for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Executive level rooms are renovated.  Perfect view of Empire State Building from room.;5
When we arrived, the lobby lovely and big.  Did not have to wait to long to check in.  We asked for an upgrade and were given two double beds on the 7th floor.  We asked if we could get three bedded room was offered this with two bathrooms for $100 each night staying for 5 nights [felt it was a lot of money] went for the one on the 7th floor.  The room was lovely, long more than wide.  No view out the window but did not mind a bit as we were at the back of the hotel and could not hear any traffic what so ever.   The beds were four ft,  Not really big enough for two to sleep comfortably so we opted to get a fold up bed at a cost of $135.   We had tea/coffee maker with pods and creme and sugar.  Two wardrobes.  Flat screen TV.  The bathroom was small enough but the shower was nice;5
Excellent in every way you could possibly imagine. Clean room. The most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. Amazing view. Helpful staff. Comfortable. The Tick Tock Diner was great. Absolutely fantastic stay and so close to so many things....Macy’s, Times Square, Empire State Building all within walking distance.;5
No worries about staying here. Perfect stay. Two restaurants right off the lobby, one casual and open 24 hours, The Tic Tock, reasonable prices. The other was for more upscale dining, still very reasonable prices. The room as super clean and just as described. The lobby was always clean too and I really liked that they screened for who got on the elevator, you had to have a room key. There is also a coffee stand in the lobby and also sells pastries, perfect for early morning coffee runs! The shower in our room was awesome, lots of water pressure and we had two closets, so plenty of space their too. I will stay her the next time I come to New York, for sure!;5
Stayed here 7 nights back in 2014 - we flew end of September. Lovely Lobby area, quick check-in however the first room given to us was way too small, spoke to lady in front desk and they were more than happy relocate us to a bigger room. The room & bathroom was clean and provided basic amenities. Concierge were great, organised private transfer back to airport and always hailed down a taxi for us when we were heading out for a night out. Perfectly located, close to Penn station, Madison square garden, you could walk to time square and explore the city. The hotel has a decent diner, breakfast is decent.  Tip - although all the rooms had wifi, we found that the lobby had the fastest internet in the hotel.;4
Stayed here 31/01 - 03/02/18 and can say it was a great base for seeing Manhattan. We arrived in New York at Penn station from Niagara falls late in the evening and was thankful that the hotel was only 1 street up and on the same avenue so not far to walk. On arrival check in was quick and we were allocated a room on the 19th floor of 40 which was small but adequate for what we needed. The hotel is art deco and a little dated but I think that added to it's charm. We were on a room only basis so we ate out from the hotel whilst we were on the go taking in the sights and smells of the City. We bought a hop on hop off bus ticket that covered 2 days for $35 each which we thought was great value and it also included a trip on the Hudson out to the Statue of Liberty taking in the;4
Went to the WKC Dog show it was only a block away. The room was small but this is NY you're not in the room much anyway. It's all about location, so close to good restaurants and other attractions all within easy walking distance. Our room was on the 37th floor. The room didn't have a refrigerator or a coffee maker.;4
Stay 4 night at the first of February. Great location across the street from MSG and a few blocks from the theatre district and time square. Good spot for breakfast in the lobby. The hotel is very clean rooms are good size for the city. And close to the subway. Security was great in the lobby. Check in was easy and quick.;5
Excellent stay.  Staff was very accommodating  to Westminster attendees.  Great location and wonderful accomodations.  Pricey parking....but that's NYC.  Clean rooms, comfortable beds and pillows.   Helpful staff and great housekeeping.;5
Fantastic hotel, so close to all the attractions of NYC!! We were upgraded to a corner room on the 19th floor which provided my wife and I with what can only be described as one of the best views ever of the Empire State Building especially at night when it’s all illuminated. With it being a corner room we also had a further window that looked on to Madison Square Garden. The staff were fantastic, always willing to help especially when directions were needed.  When we return to this great city, I will have no hesitation in booking this hotel again or recommending it to others.;5
The hotel was bustling with Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show presenters and spectators.  Hotel staff were always accommodating and pleasant.  Even during a two-day rain,  everyone was helpful.  Public spaces were always clean and guest rooms were comfortable.;4
I just stayed in this fab hotel for 4 nights. This hotel is in a great location, we arrived in the late evening to check in where we met Mohammed such a gentleman who upgraded us to a room with 2 beds and a great view of the Empire State Building, Mohammed also called the room to ensure we were happy with the room. We ate in  Tick Tock adjoined to the hotel it was also lovely. The hotel had some dogs staying for the Westminster kennel club dog show, this was a great treat as we are both dog lovers. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be back again.;5
Stayed at the new yorker hotel from the 8th February till 13th February. It was nearly midnight by the time we got to the hotel and had a very quiet check in. We were give a newly refurbished room on the 8th floor and the Bell boy took our luggage to our room. Room.  The room was one of the newly refurbished rooms with 2 double beds in it a coffee machine and also a fridge which was nice as I had read other reviews where many people said they had no fridge or coffee machine so it was a nice surprise  there was a small corner which had 2 arm chairs in it where you could sit and read we had a chest of draws with 3 draws and 2 wardrobes which was nice as there where 3 of us staying in the room. The only thing that let the room down was the size of the bathroom which is very small;4
The hotel we usually stayed at was booked so we tried this one.  I am glad we did.  The rooms were large for NYC, beds were comfortable, rooms were clean, view was great.  Location is convenient.  It is an older hotel but clean and renovated enough.  The Italian restaurant downstairs is wonderful.  Next time we head to NYC, I will definitely be looking for a room at the New Yorker. There is a lot of great history on the hotel too.;5
This hotel was great! The staff were all happy and friendly especially on the information desk. The hotel was overall great but some areas could do with upgrades. Regardless you couldn’t get a better location! Penn station directly outside and times square straight up the road. We had a fantastic and will be coming back next year.;5
Spacious, clean, comfortable rooms. Friendly, efficient staff. And location, location, location! The New Yorker is practically within spitting distance of Madison Square Garden, Penn Station and the subway. Also has nice-sized and well-equipped meeting rooms for groups.;5
"The hotel is beautifully decorated in Art Deco Style. Staff is friendly and helpful and security is very good. You have to show your key card to get to the elevators. Eight years ago, my sister and I were there with a tour from Road Scholar. We had a spacious, beautifully decorated room and bath. This year, still with Road Scholar, we had a tiny room and bath. Bathroom tile needed replacing or regrouting, black grout, yuck.  Had to edge my way between the foot of the bed and the tv stand/dresser to a place under the window where I could open my suitcase. ONE, I repeat ONE convenient. available electric outlet to charge electronics. My sister crawled under the ""desk"" to get to the only other one we could find. There was an outlet in the bathroom but the shelf was only wide enough";4
The rate was great as long as you avoid the upsells.  I did not win the great room lottery, as I have had better rooms in the past. Three good restaurants in house. Great location.  Cabs outside.  Doorman.  Subway at corner, more trains at Penn Station virtually across the street.;4
We are staying at the New Yorker Hotel at the moment we are on the 24th floor, room is a little smaller than I expected but the two queen beds are amazing so comfortable. I want to take it home with me. Pillows are soft and cuddly too. Lovely powerful shower and bath too. We don’t have much of a view but if we tilt sideways we can see the street and tall buildings. I would recommend this hotel the staff are friendly and security is tight here we feel very safe. Tick tock diner next door is amazing we had pancakes and bacon for breakfast which  are sooooo nice. We are central and close to Times Square. I love NY and will be back and will definitely stay in the New Yorker.;5
Fab hotel very clean and food fab in Tick Tock diner that's open 24hrs, great location near to Times Sq and Empire State Building, brill staff all very pleasant and helpful and hotel very security conscious which is a bonus  and great big room x;5
We were celebrating our 8th wedding anniversary and as part of our itinerary customised by our tour agent, we stayed in The New Yorker for 3 nights. We were first given the executive room on the 7th floor. The room was very nice and newly renovated but very small. Despite having a coffee machine, amazing shower and charging station on both side tables, we felt claustrophobic so asked to be moved upstairs with a view. We were moved to the 28th floor. The room was dated but lighter and bigger. The shower head was very close to the wall but we were amazed how strong the water pressure was. The bed and pillows were excellent. We need this kind of bed in our home! This hotel is located near Madison Square, Penn Station, Macy’s and Empire State Building. After checking in, 2 ladies;4
Stayed here for 5 nights in  Feb I am at a loss to why my review is so far adrift from others on here that find the place great. Firstly the lobby is fine but that’s it once you get in the lift and enter the corridors oh my so depressing and needs some TLC I can’t remember  the number of the first room but it was awful really awful after travelling for over 20hrs I just wanted to go to sleep but off I went to reception to ask for a different room so was very happy to be told we were getting a newly refurbished one well it was better nice basin lol and tv (not bothered when in New York about TV) the workmanship in these rooms is awful therefore everything looks tatty I definitely would not recommend this hotel. Location was good but very very noisy wish I took some earplugs;2
We had a great time and this hotel is in a great location. The rooms were clean and the service was great. We will go back.;5
"I can't say enough about how wonderful my stay is.  Mohammed helped check me in. As a Wyndham Rewards member they have a special desk and you actually sit down while Mohammed checks you in.  What an amazing person!  He was hospitable, kind, and got me into a room as quickly as possible.  I happened to mention being on a higher floor.  Was I shocked to be put on the 39th floor with an amazing view of the Empire State building. The refrigerator had sodas and water in it.  After I was in the room about 10 minutes, Mohammed phoned to inquire if everything was satisfactory.  Believe me, as a person whose on the road a lot, this kind of attention is unheard of.  I asked about the drinks in the refrigerator and his response was ""They are from me to make your stay more enjoyable"".  Wow.";5
Great hotel, facilities and location.  Great diner and further bar next door. Fab location in mid town Manhattan (34th street and 8th Avenue). Standard rooms are smaller than most hotel rooms - upgrade recommended. (8th floor rooms are small but do have bath robes) Irons, hair dryers and coffee machine are standard in all rooms.  Would definitely stay again.;5
Everything was excellent. The service and the staff were friendly and accommodating. We at the Tick Tock diner for breakfast and Banker and Butcher for dinner. Both were recommended and both were outstanding. Our room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. Located in mid Manhattan close to everything we wanted to do. We were catching an Amtrak train to Chicago and Penn Station is 1 block away. Very convenient. There is a Starbucks across the street and great restaurants within easy walking distance. Look forward to staying there again!;5
Hotel is very Stately Not sure what was going on but folks seem preoccupied with work . I Saw at least 6 hotel personnel in lobby not one engaged my party with a smile or a welcome. Passed several folks in hallways, not one said hi. Service just isn't on par with the stars. Without the hospitality this is just an old mt box. The competition is too strong to compete on points. Room was nice n spacious for a NY. Hotel. When you wash your hands in the bathroom the water comes out with force and hits the stopper and splashes right on you.  Too Funny !  Place is nice and close to Msg. My view out my Windows look into a hole. If you cant check in then plan to wait 25-40 minutes in a line to check your bag. This line was a constant thing, think you might have figured this out by now .;3
Great location for business or a vacation. The staff is amazing. They really care about their guests.;5
We stayed at the New Yorker for 5 nights and I cannot say one negative thing about it. Upon arrival we had a seamless check in and received a room upgrade and a complimentary bottle of wine for our anniversary.   Our room was spotless and had everything you would need from fridge to safe to iron/board etc and were cleaned every day. On the 21st floor you could hear some noise from below but not enough to be annoying but hey it was New York and it added to the experience.   The adjoining diner and restaurants are also unbelievable and great for any meal at any time.   There is a gym but didn’t get to use it. I had a look though and it is also pristine. Again I cannot fault the hotel or its staff and the security when going to the lifts is a nice touch for your safety. The;5
We stayed in New Yorker hotel for one week. Old hotel, but renovated. It is on amazing location, 10/15 min. walk to Times Square, Rockefeller center, Empire State Building etc....across the Strees is Madison Square Garden and Penn Station Subway. We had an amazing time in NY.;4
Staff are amazing, so friendly and helpful. There was a small issue with my room which they wouldn't have known but as soon as I told the desk staff I was moved to another room immediately. I stayed over Christmas 2017 and found the staff in the hotel over the holiday period to be fantastic to their guests. Rooms were clean with clean bedding towels daily, food in the café very good. Would definitely stay again :-) Well done to all their staff;5
I'm currently writing this review from my bed in the New Yorker. I actually couldn't wait until I got home to write this review. I am super impressed by the hotel and the super friendly and helpful staff. I booked this trip for my mum's birthday amd to keep the cost low (as it was my treat) I just booked us a double room, which may I add we would have been fine with. Upon checking in they said 'just a minute, I see there are two of you and just the one bed, I'm gonna give you a bigger room'. I was over the moon. They went on to mention that the room they were giving us had the most amazing views. I've stayed in NY many times and each time I was here my only views were of offices! The views from our room are spectacular. Check the pictures below. The New Yorker is in such a great;5
We stayed only a night at the New Yorker. The public spaces have recently been refurbished and are elegant and lovely. The staff were attentive and helpful and the rooms were a good size. Although the public spaces have been refurbished, the room we had has not and was perfectly functional, but a little bit dated. Nonetheless we thought it was well located and good value for money.;4
Traveled to NYC with friends for a w/e to attend the St. John' vs Duke basketball game in Madison Square Garden. The New Yorker was our group's choice as it's right across the street! The hotel is an old 1930s era edifice with recent renovations. The room we had was spacious by NYC standards and clean though the bathroom was small. Both were clean. There was more than adequate closet space as well as drawer space in a bureau. In short, it was was a nice clean room and very good value in the heart of Manhattan!;4
We stayed at The New Yorker for 15 nights during a recent trip to New York. Prices were great $1300 for the said 15 nights. Room was fab, very clean with a sparkling bathroom. Ahh the bed was so comfy!! Staff were all great. The hotel has a diner (we ate there a few times) which is really good and although we didn't eat at the hotels other two  restaurants we did hear other guests complimenting both. Really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend.;5
The Newyorker suited our needs. It is an old hotel with a lot of history. Rooms are very compact and not much has been renovated, particularly the bathrooms which feature very old school taps which come with typical leaks and creaks. Great location to Times Square and events at Madison Square Garden.;4
The hotel is very located, on the eight avenue close to the main point of attractions (Times Square, Madison square garden and Macy's). The room are a bit small and the bed as well. It was a double room.  The bathroom needs some renovation but it is all clean and nothing major. What I didn't like was on the time of check in, the lady asked for my credit card. I asked why she was requesting for it as I had the reservation fully paid. She just responded to me that it was the hotel's policy to take a deposit of usd 45 on the time of check in. I told her that I was not informed about that police on the time of booking and she just looked at me and said it was the hotel policy. She was a bit arrogant. I think that it shall me made clear this policy so that we are aware when arriving;4
Location! Location! Location! The hotel is very central. Penn Station is a minute away and Times Square is 10 minuets away. If you like to shop, Macy’s is quite literally a 5 minute walk. The hotel was nice enough. Our room felt a bit out dated but most of the staff were lovely and welcoming. Myself and my partner stayed in 2118, and although we didn’t have a fantastic view, (just of the building opposite of offices and apartments) the room was great as a base! My moms experience with the hotel wasn’t fantastic, as her room card wouldn’t work and she has to go down to reception every day to get it fixed. Her room was also very small and dull, however, it was only a base! As there were 3 of us, instead of it being a $29 a night per room fee, they reduced it to $15. Overall had a;4
PERFECT NYC STAY!  Beyond welcoming  Beyond friendly  Beyond accommodating  SO PROFESSIONAL!!!!!!!!  I travel to nyc weekly and this is my favorite spot to stay due to the unbelievable staff- thank you to the following stars in my eyes⭐️- Michael  Simms( BEST manager), Jessica, Simimi, Ronald, krystle.  God bless them all.  My international company and I will always come back here.;5
Excellent stay, centrally located and friendly staff.Rooms are traditional but very clean and very spacious.Go and see Tesla's room and make sure to try the diner below.Staff are very friendly and good at advising on Taxis etc.;5
Location, location, location! we stayed here only because of that as I think the rooms and hotel in general is overpriced, the rooms and building could use some updating, our room was super tiny but is just what we needed since we were out most of the day. We also went during xmas time which meant high prices.The staff were friendly upon check in, it was fast and easy. This hotel is super close to some main attractions, the Empire State Building is maybe a 10 min walk away, the subway and MSG is right across from it and if you don't mind walking you can make it all the way down to Times Square (we did that a couple of times), all in all I would stay here again if it were the only budget choice close to attractions and subway.;3
"Good centrally located hotel on 7th ave ;room we had was small but had everything we needed, staff very professional; and good lobby security. 3 restaurants in hotel the tick tick is good  New York style diner food and open 24 hours would definitely use this hotel again";4
Friendly helpful staff, rooms clean and great service. Tick tock restaurant has great food and reasonably priced and extra shout out to the lovely polish waitress who gave us great friendly service and information on our pending trip to Vegas. She went over and beyond her job and treated us like a friend. Great location, central to all top venues. Highly recommend and will most definitely return.;5
Our beds were comfortable and the rooms were GREAT! The hotel was close to everything we wanted! The only complaint would be that we smelt wakey backy quite strong on our floor for 2 days we  asked the doorman to get us a tax to the airport i he said yes for 85 dollars we also asked in the hotel information  and they said they could get us one for 100 dollars  ...;4
So, I have to stay where my company puts me and usually it's E55th, so tres tres excited I'm staying somewhere different...   Let me start by area.... it's so different and quite busy with tourists and locals alike, a couple of pharmacies and the bright lights of madison square gardens make for a welcome change.... there's an open air bar across the road, and a fantastic pizzeria exactly opposite! (Buffalo chicken pizza after a couple of beers... mmmmmm!)  But those were the positives... being a touristy hotel come the parties... my next door was loud - not just because they were, but because the walls were paper thin!!!!!!  Ok... ok... you can't change an historical building blah de blah de blah... but at least put some sort of soft door closing mechanism on each guest room!;3
We stayed at this hotel in jan this year. The entrance of the hotel is beautiful. The staff where all very friendly and their is always 1 person that checks ur room key before you get on the elevator to make sure your staying at the hotel. The room we stayed in was not overly big but we only laid our heads so it served its purpose. The room view was over looking maddison sq gdns which was lovely at night. The room was cleaned and bed made every day. I enjoyed my stay here and would stay again for sure. Its quite central to like i said a stone throw from maddison sq gdns and about 5-10 mins walk from time square. Lovely....;4
Well we can honestly say that this hotel hit all the right points for us. This was our honeymoon and the staff could not have been more friendly helpful and accommodating. They upgraded us to a suite in the refurbished rooms above the 20th floor. We had a bottle of rose in our room and everything was fantastic. The hotel is situated in a great location close to Penn station. We took the train in from Newark airport which easy cheap and fast. Once out if the station the hotel was just across the road.  The view from the room was of the empire state building, and Madison square garden.  Loved every minute of the visit which was made so much better by the staff at this wonderful hotel.;5
"I was charmed by this hotel. The remaining art deco features are a delight. The adjacent ""Diner"" was superb with lovely food and charming and helpful waiters. It's location is superb (just down the road from Macy's) and close to Maddison Square. Okay, so some of the rooms are a bit dated - but that's the charm? Security and staff excellent.";4
Our beds were comfortable and the rooms were GREAT! The hotel was close to everything we wanted! The only complaint would be that we thought we heard pipes during different times...sign of the age of the building.;4
I I Stay at the New Yorker whenever I come into New York to shop in the Garment District. It is convenient to both the district and to the Amtrak station making it the perfect location. The staff is responsive and caring and the classic architecture is fascinating;5
Great hotel. Rooms small but clean and bed was very comfortable. There was always hot water for a shower and the towels were changed every day along with the bed! Really good location. The hotel is next to Penn station and Times Square is only 10mins walk away. Mohammed was very helpful when we checked in and we would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in New York for a few days.;4
I really enjoyed the three nights I spent at the New Yorker. I was in town for work, so while I didn't do any sightseeing, it's in a great location to enjoy the city. While the rooms were small (as I had expected) they were clean and comfortable. I would stay here again.;4
Great hotel to spend a weekend in New York city. The room was nice and clean. The staff was friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable of the city whereabouts. I will definitely stay in this hotel again.;5
This was where we stayed for our 2018 Girls trip to NYC.  Location is close to Macy’s, Empire State Building, Starbucks, restaurants and the Subway.  It was a short walking distance to Time Square, Broadway plays, Radio City Music Hall & train station.  As for the hotel the sink in my room wouldn’t drain.  The shower was such hat you needed to get in to start the water.  Comfortable bed and quiet dark room.  I’d stay here again, but there were “hidden” fees of almost $30.  My $159 a night resulted in a $209 stay.  They put a $45 hold on my card, but I expected that.;4
My fiance' , my son, and I drove from Ohio to The New Yorker.  My son is staying here for 4 months as they house the students in the NY Arts Program.  He is in an internship.  They offered us as parents of a student a discount on the price of the stay.  That was nice.  But, coming from Ohio and arriving in NY for the first time I was shocked by the hidden fees.  Our price doubled after we had to pay for valet parking and the hotel fees.  We had to use the valet parking as we had the car completely full of his items for his stay.  (We couldn't see out the back window)  We couldn't use the service entrance as it was blocked by several vehicles and as it was our first time being in NY we did what we had to do.  The hotel made me think back to what patrons felt like in the 40s and;4
This only redeeming feature of this hotel is the location.   The hotel is truly awful, from the minute you step up to the doors the staff are uninterested and unhelpful,  the rooms unappealing and tired.   NEVER AGAIN!;1
Very comfortable, with beautiful landscaping.  The pool area is beautifully landscaped and the large deck off the kitchen is perfect for relaxing and outdoor dining. This property was like vacationing in a deluxe resort.;5
I must admit we arrived and had a few teething problems with check in and our room being our honeymoon I was quick to me tion my issues to the management as I wanted my husband and I to have the best time possible. And once I'd raised my issues the hotel was amazing we received a room upgrade it was amazing we had a view of the empire state building and a balcony, tea and coffee machine which if you don't already have in your room you can ask reception and they will provide one for you. The beds aren't the best and neither are the bathrooms but your in new York so don't spend a massive time in either of these. The location of the hotel is spot on across the road from the train station so easy to reach from the airport and also within walking distance of practically everything;5
My husband and I stayed here for three nights, 17th-19th January. The hotel was great, very clean, friendly and helpful staff, even when checking in at 12am. The location of the hotel was great, especially when arriving into penn station late at night, the hotel was straight across from the tube station so we didn't have far to walk with our cases.  The hotel had a great place for breakfast next door, the tic tick diner. We ate here every morning as it was tasty and plenty of choice. The hotel was very central to everything, a few minutes walk from Times Square, Rockefeller centre and the Empire State Building. We had to check out on the last day at 12, so we decided to check our earlier and do some last minute shopping, we were able to leave our bags in a storage room for a;5
Our second time in a year staying here for a winter weekend getaway. When my wife and I requested a larger room they couldn't have been more helpful and found us one within 15 minutes. A busy place but isn't that what NYC is all about??  The Tick Tock diner is awesome (which is attached to the lobby). We will definitely be back the next time we're in Manhattan.;5
Location is excellent, whether walking to Central  Park, Ground Zero or to the East River. Access to LIRR or Subway is immediate. Comfortable lobby if you need a place to relax and watch people. We would stay here again.;5
Professional, helpful staff.  Our room was very clean. Always a security check at elevators. Located just a couple of short blocks from Penn Station. It was an easy walk to Times Square/Theatre district. There is a CVS pharmacy open 24hrs next door with a good supply of water, snacks, etc. Lots of coffee shops in the immediate area (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, etc).;5
My room was fully paid for in advance through Booking.com and was upgraded at check in at an extra cost of $14.00 USD per night. The room was on the 36th Floor. I had a view of higher buildings and part of the Hudson River and this was not worth the upgrade at all. I paid a lot of money to stay in this accommodation for seven nights. The Tick Tock Diner was a 24 hour Diner with good fresh meals and I recommend this place which is just off the hotel lobby. I had a problem with one of the Receptionists who was rude and unfriendly. I reported her and finally got an apology from Guest Services after emailing them twice. I am not sure whether to return to this hotel on my next visit to New York City The room was clean and although small it had a comfortable bed and reasonable private;4
Stayed for 4 nights hotel is clean .rooms  are spacious Maybe in some need of refurb but staff are helpful and friendly.  So close for lots of main attractions(10 mins walking distance) most of them but subway is just round corner from hotel. Used hotel diner ( excellent service and food). I would definitely stat here again!;5
I write this review as I have been woken up for the third night running by party-goers returning rowdily to their rooms at 3.30am.  This is a huge hotel with 40 floors and the single rooms are small and uninspiring. The beds have a very thin quilt and for two nights I used my coat as a blanket before housekeeping picked up my call and I requested a second quilt.  The taps in the bathroom are stiff and I cannot open the cold tap but as no one picks up my calls to the front desk I have had to make do.  The feel of this place is like a giant youth hostel or budget guest house. The low price for the central location is its only advantage. And here come some more yelling and giggling party goers at 4am.;2
The New Yorker hotel is set in a great  location and exhibits beautiful Art Deco architecture which reminds of us of New York’s past Again on entrance you see glimpses of the hotel’s art deco past looking rather tired in a very busy lobby . The hotel staff are very welcoming and friendly .   Step inside the lift your taken to your floor . Mine resembled a scene from the ‘shining’ soulless corridors again very tired and dull looking . My room with a view of a window into the room of another guest was not the greatest disappointment . The room was small lacking in some modern comforts such as master light switch by bed a very uncomfortable bed (and oddly the only hotel which doesn’t invest in a thick mattress protector ) - not enough space for my suitcase etc . The bath room - no;2
Stayed five nights in January. Check in was quick and we were delighted to have been offered a room upgrade and a bottle of wine. It was a birthday celebration. Thank you it was a lovely gesture.  The rooms are well decorated. Bed was very comfortable and the upgrade gave us a great view towards the river. The shower was great, very powerful.  We did hear a few comments about the rooms being small. Maybe by US standards but if in the Uk it was a generous size for a city hotel. The corridors are looking a bit tired, but it didn't detract from our experience.   Tic Toc diner is excellent. Great food, great service and comparably priced to other diners in the area.  The main benefit of this hotel is the location. The subway entrance is right next to the hotel, with other entrances;4
When we arrived and checked in we were given a FREE UPGRADE we thought wow that’s nice of them we were told it was a new floor, once we got in the room we were instantly disappointed the room was certainly small and quiet clearly had been redecorated 20 years ago, after going out we came back too the hotel we thought we would have some tea then go up for night back in the room we had a vibration noises coming through the wall the was vibrating this lasted about 30 minuets on and off it then started again at 3.30 in the. Morning we complained the next dat and was offered two alternatives both looked like they were stuck in the 1940 and one door wouldn’t lock so we stayed in the room we had the toilet started to leak every time it was flushed and was never fixed even though we;2
Little gutted there was no tea coffee in room.  But facilities were   downstairs  . perfect place right in centre.  Unfortunately there were no views out window ,just bricks.  Staff were lovely and helpful.  The hotel was dated. But wouldn't stay here again .;3
When we arrived at this hotel our travel agents got the year wrong for our booking but the check in assistant linda was absolutely fantastic with helping us get sorted out. The room was good size, the bathroom was basic but done the job.;4
This hotel is in a great location really central to walk and use the subway ,it’s a clean hotel and the adjoining tick tick diner is handy for breakfast ,we had two rooms with two queen beds in each and one with a double bed,not huge rooms but rooms and bathrooms were clean;5
I have literally left for the airport home as I write this, but felt compelled to write a completely honest view for our stay.  If you read the many reviews on here with lots of negative comments, then please take them with the tiniest grain of salt.  This is a great hotel. The only very very minor gripe I have was when we first arrived we were asked to have breakfast at another Wyndham run property, which they offered $200 if we attended. Wasn’t interested,but thought it was a bit much considering we had only been in the hotel for a few minutes.  However that was only only minor thing I would say. I quickly forgot about it and got on with my holiday.  The hotel staff are mostly very polite and attentive, and would do whatever they could to help you. I have read some reviews;5
Our room was very small. My friends had rooms nearlly twice the size, even though we had all paid the same price. I suggest you ask for one of the larger rooms when you book.   The staff in the hotel vary so much in customer service. After a long flight we arrived at the hotel to be met be met by a frosty, receptionist. No hello, no welcome. It was...... Name ! Fill in this form ! Credit card details ! Heres your room key !  Um.........yet the concierge, especially the lady were wonderful when we asked for directions.   I loved the art deco features, though agree the hotel is tired looking. Saying that, the bar area is modern, clean and we ordered some hot nibbles which were lovely.  The cleaner did a great job and the bed was comfy.   Be warned - We booked the hotel pick up;3
We stayed one night while traveling thru NYC.  We selected the New Yorker because it is so convenient to Penn Station, and the price was affordable.  The check-in was fast.  Room and bath were well appointed, even though it was small.  Everything was CLEAN and lighting was great.  Didn't get charged the facility fee, and didn't ask questions.  Would stay again.;5
The hotel was clean, with good beds and quite reasonable, if basic, facilities.  It is lovely to see the beautiful Art Deco features still in place but it needs an upgrade - carpets, decor and so forth.  It did the job for four nights but it isn't really that quiet between rooms.  It is very well placed on eighth Avenue so it's popular.;3
We are just returning from having spent 3 days in this very dated hotel. On arriving we were 4th in the line at reception, it took 30 mins to get to the reception process and a further 10 mins to check in. A very slow and unprofessional process. We asked if we could have a nice room and we're told she would upgrade us. That was a pleasant surprise, until we got to the room. It was very small with a bath about 4ft long with a poorly functioning shower head fixed to the wall. The room was very dated, although I must admit the rather small double bed was comfortable. The wardrobe had a very bad smell so we didn't use it. On our second morning there was no hot water, so after contacting reception and waiting about 30mins my wife requested a kettle so we could at least heat some;1
Myself and my husband have just returned from staying 3 nights here. I was a little disappointed at the standard of the room... Check in... well it was speedy... although there was no queue.. but the female behind the desk did not communicate at all...’in fact I’m being polite by saying maybe she had a bad day! She gave us no information at all... Asked For credit card and handed us our room cards! Room... our room was on the 25th floor... I’m Sure it was once a store room! Very small... lucky for us we are married a while and not shy.. as if one of us as using the bathroom...let’s just say it was all very cosy!! Now all we needed was a base... for that it was ok. There was a hairdryer and a few toiletries. The bed was made everyday and the towels changed if needed! The maids;3
This is a great hotel for you NYC stay.  We had a family suite for 4 (2 adults, 2 teenage kids).  Room as big enough with 2 bathrooms. Quiet (for NYC).  Excellent staff - check in and out a breeze).  I was disappointed with the quality of the fold away bed, but it was better than the others we had during our USA holiday.  Location is great - easy access to subway, short walk to Empire State, Times Sq etc.  We would stay again.;4
The hotel is in a great location, very central. The staff are great, especially Mohammid on reception.  Rooms are a little dated but the beds are so comfortable . Our room had a fantastic view. We were given a complimentary room upgrade and a bottle of wine. Would most definitely stay there again;4
We had a great stay over the Unifieds weekend. The hotel is very close to all the audition studios. Very convenient and clean. The Tick Tock Diner is open 24/7 and has great food. We will definitely stay again!;5
This hotel is in a great location. Penn Station is a block away and you can easily walk to many many places such  as Times Square, Broadway, Hell’s Kitchen etc. Its in the garment district so if you have a chance definitely take one of Mike’s walking tours!   Anyway back to the hotel. We were there for my daughter’s birthday weekend. We arrived in the city at 10 am and expected to check our luggage but they had our room ready which was awesome! Except the bed was super small and there was zero room to walk/move. The room was on the 7th floor and TIGHT! The owners desk staff was very nice and helpful in getting us switched to a more appropriate room on that floor. This wound up being one that had room for a roll away since they said they had no more double beds.   Overall the;3
We stayed at the New Yorker over the Halloween period, and as it was our first trip to NYC we chose this hotel due to its location.   Situated directly opposite Madison Square Garden and on the same street (34th) as the Empire State building, the hotel is also only a few blocks walk from Times Square and not a million miles away from Central Park (visit the zoo if you get chance). If you wanted to visit the bottom of the island to see Wall St and see the 9/11 site, I recommend using the underground.  Check-in in and check-out of the hotel were fairly straightforward even though there was quite a queue we had to wait in.   The hotel itself was a bit dated in its decor and the rooms were small, but i suppose this is to be expected when visiting a city like New York where space is;4
We stayed here and went to see a show on Broadway and the Christmas tree. The location was perfect. The room was spacious and clean. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel and attached is also a diner that is open 24 hours!;5
We arrived and check in was fast and lady on reception was Colombian  she couldn’t of been anymore helpful and we was made to feel very welcome. We had missing luggage and this lady straight away said use our phone and was very friendly and helpful. She also arranged for a cot to brought to our room straight away. Door staff on arrival very friendly and helpful. Our room was nice and clean and although on the little side was more than adequate for our stay. We are at the tick tock diner and the food and service was nothing but pleasant. We also highly recommend the butcher and the banker staff are very nice and ensure you have everything you need. The hotel bar was nice but the staff was very abrupt and rude. We ordered our baby a child’s meal and we wasn’t hungry so we just had;5
To meet my hometown friend after so long time. Such a nice place to stay and good for meet someone and invite for lunch or dinner in walking distance to nice restaurant. So clean lobby and so many elevators for quick access.;5
Upon arrival we were given a free upgrade to a stunning double room on the 29th floor with incredible views and the Empire State Building as the most perfect view. The room is lovely spacious and airy, very clean with extremely comfortable beds, even with all the outside noise you should sleep 💤 well. The front of house staff have been just fantastic. Could not be more helpful. Any little problem they have sorted it.  We are currently on our third night out of 5 nights.  This hotel came highly recommended. It is in the heart of NYC and everywhere is in with easy reach. Broadway is a 10 minute walk from the top end. 10 minutes to the Empire State Building. 15 minutes to Ground Zero. Highly Recommend and if you shop around you can get some great rates for staying here.;5
Stayed here for 4 nights with family. Not a bad location, about 10 mins walk from Times Square. While the room was clean and beds very comfortable it wasn’t the upgrade we were promised. Quite drafty around the windows and the corridors are in need of some tlc.;3
Been there with my wife on our anniversary. The staff was really polite and helped us through out everything we asked. Bartender was a bit arrogant,but we enjoined our stay and will definitely pay a visit again once I get the opportunity;5
The WNY is in an excellent location 5 minutes walk from the empire state building we had a view of it from our room also walking distance to times square and Madison square gardens. And Macy's is literally a block away. Central park is a $2 subway ride away.  On arriving we had to wait 5 hours for our room to be ready and having booked a 3 person room for 3 adults we got 2 queen beds. Not great when travelling with your 17 year old son and 17 year old step daughter so I had to share a bed with my son. Complained to reception and was told hotel fully booked nothing they could do. Bathroom although fully functional and clean was tiny. You literally couldn't swing a cat. Extra charges were everywhere. To leave your cases until room was ready was $5 per bag. To collect cases was $5;3
Just home from a 4 night stay in The New Yorker and we had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay at the hotel. The staff were very accommodating and friendly, the lovely lady who booked us in (sorry I can't remember her name after 17 hours travelling) was an absolute star. She waived the resort fees and sorted out our deposit so we didn't have to pay $300 cash. The room was exceptionally clean and the bed, oh my! that bed and pillows were heavenly. The room was always warm and we had a bit of a view of downtown which was stunning. The reason I give 4 stars is the lack of amenities within the room, no kettle meant paying $4 for a cup of tea from the diner and being Irish I drink a lot of tea. Also the water temperature of the shower was temperamental, one minute cold and the next;4
I loved the location , beds were so comfortable , friendly staff and fast room service .. the only complaint I have is the extra hotel fee , for things that should be included anyway .;5
This is a very nice hotel in a very centric location in Manhattan. You can walk to major points of interest from it or you can get to the primary subway lanes to help you get anywhere. Half a block from MSQ and very near the Empire States building it has a great view of some of Manhattan iconic buildings by just walking outside its door. It should improve its breakfast offering. What includes is a voucher for a coffee/juice + muffin +fruit, a very poor selection for the price you pay for the rooms. By the way don't expect much space although if you are lucky they can accomodate you if you don't feel spacious enough.;4
First of all, our room was so much better than we ever thought it would be. We had a twin room and we both had double sized beds. On our first night there, I had the best night's sleep I'd had in months!!! We even had a random small room adjourning ours and due to the temperatures outside we were able to store some drinks and food in there and there were refrigerated very well! The staff were attentive and always polite. The decor of the hotel is awesome. Whatever area of the hotel we were in, it was always clean and tidy. It had a very relaxing atmosphere as well.;5
This is my third time in this hotel. No doubt that every time gets better than the other... We receive an upgrade to a small suite.  The room is nice, two bedrooms. Cafe mashing. The bathroom is very small and the shower is made New. The personnel is great always trying to help. The only thing is very uncomfortable to show the room card each time you have to accede the elevators.;4
This is my third time at this hotel and I always have a wonderful time. The staff here are just great. I asked for an upgrade upon arrival and they upgraded me complimentary. Every time I am in New York, this is my go to place. The customer service is what makes it what it is.;5
Overall, this place was very good, with just a couple of things that kept me from giving it an excellent rating.  We requested one of the higher rooms, so we could have a view, and it was worth every penny.  The room was surprisingly big, with a decent sized bed, and plenty of room around it.  There was a desk and chair, bedside drawers and wardrobe space.  The bathroom was a reasonable size, with a shower over the bath, wash hand basin, toilet and a cabinet with towels in.  The heating was fantastic, and believe me, with snow on the ground and the wind-chill factor, we certainly put it through its paces.  There was loads of hot water too.  The staff were polite, friendly and went out of their way to help.  After we checked out, we were able to store our bags there, for a dollar;4
I love this hotel, I will be staying for the fourth time in a couple of weeks and everytime I stay I have a fantastic time. All of the staff are lovely and very helpful if you encounter any problems, they will also try their best to move your room if you are unhappy with it for any reason. It is very secure as the security check your room keys before you can enter the lifts, which i love, especially as the surrounding area isn't the best. The bigger rooms are definitley better if you are staying for a longer period of time, the metro ones are fine- but there is not much space for two people. The tick tock diner is a massive bonus! I eat here nearly every morning of my trip and the food is always quick and super fresh! I really can't wait to stay here again in a couple of weeks;5
We stayed here after arriving in NYC from Penn station so location was great. However the check in took about 30 mins only two staff on and even though there was a big queue no more more staff were allocated to the reception. It was 23:30 and we were tired so not a good start. The room was very small even by New York standards so good job we were only staying one night. If you stay here you will need ear plugs for the street noise. There is a 24 hour diner on site as well as an Italian restaurant. We had breakfast in the diner which was good and reasonable. Check out was also slow with a queue so the concierge ended up checking me out.  I was looking forward to staying in this iconic hotel but felt a bit disappointed by the experience.;3
This hotel is in an amazing location to access all attractions you would want to see for a first time visit. Yes rooms are a little tired but for the money you pay well worth it. The rooms are clean and warm with very hot water for the shower.  The staff have been excellent throughout our 5 day trip and very helpful in offering travel advice for subway etc. The hotel room walls are a little thin and you can here next door running the shower but that did not cause us any issues. Would definitely recommend!;5
Stayed here this October on a girlie trip to New York. I simply love this hotel. We booked 2 room for 4 girls. We had plenty of space, magnificent view and its spotlessly clean. There is a diner to the left off the foyer as well. It’s reasonable enough and the food is beautiful. The hallways leave this hotel down a bit as they look dated but it doesn’t take from the hotel experience at all. You’re near Macy’s and just a subway ride to everywhere else! I absolutely love staying here..;5
Stayed here early Jan 2018 with wife and baby  we emailed a few questions before arrival and we received quick and good responses... one was an early check in this cost us $ but it was great for us with baby  the lobby is a nice sight to come in to and the desk staff were really friendly and helpful I'd prepaid so no hidden charges but all the tax and resort fees were itemised on the checkout summary  we booked a queen room with view and we got a room on 23rd floor with view out of the back of the hotel and could see the Hudson and nothing directly looking in to our room  we took our own travel cot and when checking in we requested some sheets for it... within 10 minutes of getting in our room housekeeping brought us 3 bed sheets   on the walk to our room the hallways look a bit;4
This was one of the worst hotels I've stayed at. Room walls paper thin, I could hear people next door talking and laughing ALL day and night. Doors closing all night echo loudly keeping me up. Tv on the wall is smallest flat screen I've seen Water in shower goes hot to cold, back and forth with no pressure Rooms are tiny and fixtures forty + years old Towel track mounted behind bath door so it opens only three quarters of the way Windows so poorly insulated i can feel cold air coming in and the street noises horns, alarms, police cars, trucks kept me up all night. Vents in room very dirty Can't believe this is a wyndham;1
This is a large Art Deco style hotel in a very central location for getting around New York. It is very close to Penn Station which has good transport links. We used this station to get a train directly to Newark Airport, which was much quicker and less expensive than a taxi. The hotel has a spacious and imposing lobby with more than enough lifts to get you to its many floors. This is a busy hotel which is used by groups as well as business people and tourists and there is sometimes a queue at the check in desk. We found the reception staff efficient and helpful and our requests were dealt with promptly. The quality of the bedrooms varies depending on the type of room you book - some have excellent refurbished bathrooms and modern decor and others have rather old fashioned;4
Good location!  Really comfortable and the lobby so nice. Such as a second home! Thank you for the good service. Room was excellent and staff are so friendly. Best experience at New York. Breakfast was nice and many types of food to order.;4
I was extremely pleased with the service staff from the moment we walked into the hotel until we checked out. The Wyndham staff went beyond what we expected to ensure we had a wonderful stay. They have the history of the hotel in the basement with events that made the New Yorker a grand place to stay.;5
The hotel is in a prime location, close to shopping areas, Pennsylvania station, Port Authority, and not far from Central station. I didn't need to deal with the staff much during my stay, but the reception lady was nice, cleaning staff was friendly as well. The room was very small, but quiet and clean. Decoration was a bit old, but basically not that a big deal to me.  What I wasn't happy about was, firstly there's no fridge in the room, which I wouldn't be happy about in summer. Secondly, there's a facility fee when you check in, which I didn't know when I made the booking. I did notice in the confirmation email, it said something about a resort fee when checking in. But prior to booking, nothing. I really hate that, because that would have voided all the comparisons in the;3
There is a hidden fee like resort fees that were not included in bookings through agoda. Many other 4star hotels like doubletree doesnt charge you for keeping the luggage for you, but this hotel does! And it was $2 per bag! I would gladly tip the person $5 for our bags instead of just paying $2 per bag. The staffs werent friendly either. The showerhead was bad thus shower experience wasnt good. And the tapwater in the tub, at first, pour brownish water for like 10-15mins. A really bad stay for a 4-star hotel. Price wasnt that cheap either.;2
I requested a refrigerator 3 times from the front desk on both days of my stay and it never came.;2
This hotel is comfortable, the staff were very helpful and the location is excellent.  We didn't have breakfast there, but it looked great.  The room we stayed was a little small but for the price we paid it was wonderful. Great bath too!;5
This was my first trip to NY & we stayed at the New Yorker for 7 nights. On arrival staff  were helpful and friendly, and I was impressed with the interior decor, check in was a little later than I’d have hoped as we couldn’t check in till 4pm, I’m sure this may not bother most but I personally like to just freshen up before heading back out after a long flight! You can leave your baggage there, it’s free for them to hold it on check in but if you need to leave it there on check out it costs $3 per bag. There is someone that asks to see your room key before allowing you to go to the lifts which I thought was really good and definitely made you feel secure. A member of staff approached us and starts telling us about how the hotel had just opened a “sister hotel” and that they;4
I stayed at the New Yorker for 4 days.  We had to move from Pensylvania Hotel (wich was awfull btw) to this nice, beautifull and cozy hotel wich was a great improvement from where we were staying first!  Our room was a little small but nicely decorated and very clean. Just be aware that there is a $29 extra daily fee for staying here,  at the end it was kind of worth it!   Very friendly staff    Breakfast is not included as most NY hotels. Couple of blocks from Penn Station which is a plus.  There is a CVS and a very nice pizza place also across the street.  Definitely going back specially if we got a special price 😊 (rates are not cheap!)   Check out the view from the hotel!  (See pic);4
Great hotel in great location.  Lots of history, rooms are well appointed and not small at all.  Reception was gracious, and fast.  Cool museum downstairs with lots of cool photos and tidbits.  Would definitely stay here again.;4
On arrival Mohammad checked us in and provided a first class service. He allocated a great room and as our trip was to celebrate a special birthday he arranged for a bottle of fizz. The hotel is in a very good location and the room was clean and perfect for our stay. New York has always plenty to offer and the location allows you easy access to all the attractions.;4
This Hotel is very expensive for the level of services that it disposes. Unkind staff by check in and check out. Rooms dit not dispose refrigitator. Comparison between service and price non reasonable.;2
We stayed here for 11 nights over Christmas & New Year. I would happily recommend The New Yorker as the location is just so convenient. We did have an added guest so were upgraded to a spacious comfortable room at no charge. Given wine for my birthday, coffee machine & pods daily, bottles of water.. thanks to Mohammad who looked after us so well.  Would stay here again.;4
I stayed at this hotel with my family last March for our Spring Break trip. We loved our stay here. I loved the Art Deco style exterior of the building. The hotel lobby was beautiful. This hotel was in a great location! We could see Madison Square Garden from our hotel window. The rooms were very spacious compared to what most New York hotels offer. I couldn't believe how reasonably priced this hotel was considering its great location in Manhattan. Easy walking distance to many great tourist attractions and districts. I also loved learning about the history of the hotel and many of its famous guests including Muhammad Ali and Nikola Tesla. I will continue to recommend The New Yorker Hotel to my friends and family and I hope to return soon!;5
Stayed from 27/12/2017-02/01/2018 Great location to all main attractions.Easy check in Mohamed was excellent upgraded  our room and gave me a bottle of wine due to having a birthday there.Room was nice and clean housekeeping was excellent and when I rang for more tea and coffee it came within 5 minutes.3 restaurants on site so didn't really need to go anywhere else.Don't use McDonald's over the road it's not the best.We ate at tick tock diner a few times food and service was good.We treated ourselves to a meal in the new butcher and banker steakhouse  restaurant on New Year's Eve the food was exceptional quite pricey though.Only one complaint there was a very rude doorman who whilst the revolving door was being fixed was at two side doors he was supposed to be greeting;4
I booked this hotel for two nights as a treat for my husband, as he's a big fan of Art deco architecture. Unfortunately, the grandeur of the hotel exterior and reception area does not continue into the rooms. Ours was extremely small, considering the price tag! We couldn't even open both our small suitcases on the floor without being stuck...  The fixtures and fittings in the room were fairly pleasant to look at, and in keeping with the deco style, however, they felt very flimsy. We also had a very small TV, with a decent selection of channels. The bathroom felt like it hadn't been changed since the say it was built - which was stylistically nice, but not at all practical! The shower was diabolical. The toiletries provided felt very 'budget hotel'. The walls were also very thin,;3
Great location for this hotel and so easy to get anywhere. It’s a great vibe and decor of real New York. Rooms were small but it is New York. It’s very busy so just be prepared to wait. The hotel views are all different so just ask for a view otherwise you will get barely a window.;4
"The room looked quite nice and everything was clean and in good shape.   I liked that it had ample charging stations for USB as well as plugs on the end tables and the desk.          They also had a coffee maker and left many coffees per day as well as a couple bottles of water per day.          It is in a great location... I was able to walk in about 10 minutes to Times Square or to Empire State Building... extremely close to MSG and to subway station.    I had an executive room... it was very small, but I expect that in NYC... (I would hate to see how small the basic room was).   The bathroom was especially small... the sink was so shallow that it was nearly impossible to run water without it splashing all over you...  No counter in the bathroom, except for the 3"" wide brim";3
The lobby is nice step into the lift and you are transported to another world. Room was very small still containing 1920 furnishings  Toilet blocked and flooded the bathroom. Moped up the mess with towels and reported it to the cleaning staff on the floor who delivered fresh towels but didnt remove the filthy ones. We were out for four hours and still maintenance or proper cleaning wasn't carried out!!! You can hear all the neighbouring rooms ...noise is an issue;1
"We wanted to be close to Penn Station and The New Yorker was perfect.  Check in went quickly; plenty of staff on hand for this busy hotel.  We booked the least expensive room and it was quite small but just perfect for the 2 of us.  Nice bed with nice bedding, very clean, and it had a wonderfully deep bathtub. Starbuck across the street for early morning coffee.";4
I cannot say how great we found the new yorker friendly helpful staff and what a hotel so close to so many attractions and subway station round the corner so easy to get everywhere.  Couldnt recommend it more for a first time or a return visit we cannot wait to go back and stay again;5
This hotel is in a brilliant location. Very central, with a subway station right on the corner. There is a lovely diner attached to the hotel called tick tock which is reasonably priced. The rooms are nicely decorated and clean. The only negative was the heating system it would turn off during the night and the room would get very cold. The staff are friendly and considerate. I would definitely stay here again.;4
As a diamond worldmark privileged member staying four nights on Wyndham Rewards, I made a fuss for a decent sized room, having firstly been accommodated with 5 bags in a dog box! They moved us into a suite on Day Two, which meant a bed we didn’t need and a bathroom of minuscule proportions, but better than what we first offered!   It was warm, relatively quiet, the bed was comfy, was nice to have a couple of easy chairs, because we spent more time in our room than usual, due to the extreme temperatures outside!   I’d never hesitate to stay again, as the convenience to Penn Station and all of NY you’d ever want to have access to, as a tourist, was great, although we used Uber and taxis more than we usually would, to keep warm!   I bought fresh milk at the diner so as to have a;4
I adored their Housekeeping staff, Rodney. He was very attentive to detail and even was kind enough to offer me more of their amenities. Room service was a bit slow though, but the food was also great in quality;4
Lovely hotel, very accommodating I got a free upgrade, two bottles of champagne and unlimited landline calls. Room excellent  beds comfortable and very very clean thank you Wyndham Hotel 8th Avenue is highly recommend you again xx;5
They have a revolving door you aren’t supposed to touch when you are going through it.  If it stops, you stop it will start again.  That was one example of a hotel that had a lot of personality located near Madison Square Garden.  It’s an older place, but looks like it has had quite a bit of renovation in recent years.  They upgraded me to what they called an executive room which seemed small and made me wonder what my original room would have looked like.  It was fine.  Didn’t spend a lot of time there anyway.  They did need to do some finishing work in the room.  I noticed a few unfinished & rusted spots.  The WiFi worked very well and you are nearby major attractions.  When checking in, I saw a desk separate from the check-in desk.  It had a Wyndham Rewards sign on it.  I;4
I enjoyed staying at this historic hotel. Great location and near Penn Station. Parking runs 40 dollars across the Street but have hotel stamp your ticket. Definitely worth the upgrade to a suit. Ask for Empire view on north side of hotel. Butcher and Banker is worth a drink or two. Museum could be better and the bathrooms need updating. Otherwise great stay.;5
Overall the hotel was convenient to everything and was walkable to Times Square, Madison Square Garden, Empire State State Building, Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. I was disappointed in the $35 facility fee per day when in my opinion there were no amenities except the gym. Also you had to ask for a coffee maker and coffee and that should really be standard. Overall staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms were small but clean. I felt they did a good job regarding safety of their guests. The tick tock diner was great for breakfast and dinner as we ate there late one evening after a play.;3
Lovely hotel very friendly staff great location rooms very clean and modern will hope to go again someday ticktock restaurant seems to be part of the hotel and the food was lovely very New York City style had a great trip;5
This is the second time we've stayed at The New Yorker Hotel and have been happy with our stay on both occasions.  The rooms aren't huge but are pretty average by New York standards. They're clean and the beds are small but comfortable. The only thing missing from the rooms are tea and coffee making facilities, but this can be organised if you ring reception.  The communal corridor areas are looking a bit on the shabby side and could probably do with an upgrade.  All things considered, The New Yorker is one of the more reasonably priced hotels in Manhattan and couldn't be better in terms of location. A great base for exploring the city.;4
We stayed 22 - 26 Dec. Good location for sight seeing. The accommodation was basic but clean. The staff were very friendly and attentive. The bathroom was showing signs of wear and tear. We tried the Tick Tock diner attached for breakfast which was typical of an American diner - a bit like the UK greasy spoon. There was a pizza place further up town on the same side that sold slices for a dollar, which was excellent value for money. There was also a Chinese supermarket on the opposite side that sold fresh fruit and buffet style Chinese food. We ate in Joe’s Shanghai in Chiba town on Christmas Day - best Chinese we have ever had - had to wait an hour for a seat probably due to it being Christmas Day.;4
Stayed here for one week in December. Great Location near the Empire State Building. Rooms small but comfortable. Clean and tidy hotel. Quiet at night so good night's sleep. We had bath and shower and the water was lovely and hot. It was nice to have a soak a bubbly bath after a long day of walking. No kettle in room but you can request a complimentary coffee machine for room. Lovely.  Stay clear of McDonald's opposite full of hobos and beggars asking for your food within the shop! Cinema around corner and Madison Square Garden nearby. Penn station a few steps away too.  Target up the road that is amazing so cheap! There's a bagel shop on 35th street a few steps away that was amazing and cheap for breakfast. There is no trouble grabbing a cab from here they pull up every few;4
While visiting NYC my family and I stayed at The New Yorker. I did see a lot of the reviews before hand and was skeptical to book because a lot of people were complaining about the service and how small the rooms were. Well, we had no problems. When we arrived we were helped out almost immediately and were treated courtiously. While the room was small, it was accommodating. My family and I made our home away from home for an entire week here. This is an older hotel and it does have a lot of history, which you are able to see as they have a mini collection down stairs that tells about it's origin. It's very clean, and the rooms are kept clean as well. Housekeeping did an excellent job, no complaints there. The only complain I do have is that there is no coffee machine, which I'm;5
We visited this hotel from 22nd to 27th November. We had read varying reviews and can only assume that those who were not pleased either have an unrealistic expectation or are used to boutique hotels that are on a much smaller scale. The lobby of this hotel is beautiful. It's art deco at its best. All throughout this hotel is the 1930s era, which is what attracted us to it. All the lightning and brass nameplates were lovely. In the basement there is a wonderful gallery of photographs and pictorial history which is a must see. From Mohammed Ali White stayed after a fight to Nicoli Tesla who lived in the hotel for a considerable period of time. Our welcome was warm and we requested a room above the 30th floor to allow for better views and we were not disappointed. We shared with;5
An old NYC Landmark Hotel centrally located to visit the City that never 🛏 sleeps, within this wonderful traditional hotel is the famous Tick-Tock restaurant that serves NYC 🍳 breakfasts 24/7 that are delicious 😋 at fair prices, & the Italian Bianco Trotteria restaurant for lunch or dinner as in Italy also reasonably priced, & for steak 🥩 Lovers a restaurant where even Texans feast , & all in house !;4
This is the second time of staying here and I still have no complaints. Yes the rooms are on the small side and a little old looking now but rooms were cleaned every day and are clean. I would definitely recommend a view room. Our view of the Empire State was brilliant. Check in was quick as was check out. It is a very busy hotel so the foyer and elevators can get packed at times. It's location is brilliant, close to Macy's and Madison square gardens and a shirt walk to Times Square. The subway is straight outside. Our facility fee was only 10 dollars a night before tax which is bearable. (We are used to this having visited Vegas multiple times)I would recommend this hotel if you are taking a short break to New York. Photo shows the view from the 23rd floor.;4
I booked this hotel in January, 11 months before our trip, as a birthday surprise for my wife, and let them know it was a special gift for her. We arrived on 23 December, and the room we were given (2129) was awful. Tiny, grim, dark. However, when we asked to change, Julia ( who is still training) went more than the extra mile to provide us with a much bigger, much more comfortable room, (2830)with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building. Thanks so much to her for this, it completely changed our holiday.  The hotel itself is a bit tired. Very brown.... a new lick of paint would make a huge difference. But it's a great old Art Deco building, lots of history, and in a fantastic location. And the staff are great, very helpful (particularly Julia and Samira). The Tick Tock;3
Stayed weekend leading up to Christmas for an impromptu NYC visit. Hotel was conveniently located across the street from Penn Station and very close to subway, Macy's, Times Square. TickTock Restaurant was very good - excellent staff - located in the hotel. Hotel staff very professional and pleasant. Rooms was clean and comfortable. Can't beat location. We got our money's worth and then some. We would definitely stay at this hotel again!;4
This hotel was very good. It has a great location, is clean and comfortable. Many places to eat very near. Train station at walking distance. In the corner of Madison square garden.  Walking to to Times Square is about 10 minutes.;5
15th till 20th December 2017: It was my first ever time visiting New York with my 2 work colleagues for a break. Overall I found New York to be an amazing city to visit and most majority of people there so lovely and welcoming. However my experience at the hotel was the worst I have ever had especially for a 4 star hotel. I was totally disgusted. First of all the rooms were so small and did not get cleaned properly as we found a previous guests sock in the corner of the room. Also there is no kettle in the rooms which is pretty poor for a 4 star hotel. Room air conditioning thermostat was rubbish, the setting is either too hot or too old and cannot be adjusted to comfort your needs. Bathroom was also tiny and so cold as the windows did not close properly. Water in taps and;1
Stayed over Christmas and am 100% satisfied. Every staff member was friendly and courteous. Very convenient location. The Tick Tock diner, while a diner, had outstanding service.   We had a slow running drain in the shower which was fixed within about an hour of us reporting it.   My wife......who works in the hospitality industry....reminds me that the shower had some mildew in it, so that's why it's a 4 star rating.   Property overall is in great shape. Rooms are appropriately sized for a downtown hotel.   Will stay again.;4
Totally great. Clean, good value, close to Penn Center trains. Couldn't have asked for better unless you want a high end. Will stay again but I'm concerned that when more people find out about it, the rates will go up. Tic Toc diner on premises was also nice and so convenient.;5
We stayed at the New Yorker for four nights as part of a Road Scholar Christmas in New York tour.  The hotel is centrally located and has two good restaurants in the lobby for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Tick Tock is more of a breakfast type historic diner. Our room was a corner room with two beds and spacious although the bath was small and dated. Several in our group were disappointed with their small rooms, so I would suggest asking for a corner room and/or two beds. The hotel was built in the 1930's so it is old/historic, but clean and well managed. No coffee maker in the rooms, but the maid service was excellent. A good experience overall.;4
2 nd time to N Y and loved it , just had to come back . The hotel is in an ideal spot to get to every thing you need to see , subway right outside as well . First impression was very cool and retro very clean and friendly staff. The Room was clean and a good size , tv , coffee machine , not much of a few but no worries. The bathroom was small but ok and all worked fine , our bed was on the small side for two adults who are not that big , so a bit uncomfortable but so tired when we got in after a day in the cold and site seeing it was ok . Would I stay here again.....??????????? Yes I think I would , so marks out of 10 !!!!!! We give it a 7 and a half to an 8 .... thanks for our stay 🇬🇧❤️🇺🇸;4
I visited here with my daughter. It was a nice place. The halls and rooms were dated but very clean. It was very convenient to Penn Station. Time Square was a bit of a walk but the price was worth the time spent walking. I probably would try and stay closer to Time Square next time because I am ill and the walk was a bit much for me. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating.;4
When we first arrived at The New Yorker I have to admit we were very unsure. The lady who first greeted us at the front desk was more interested in the other staff members around her than ourselves and we felt very unwelcome after a long 7 hour flight. When we arrived at our room, it was absolutely tiny and could only just fit a double bed and a desk. It was also absolutely freezing and very near the elevators, and I knew I couldn’t sleep there for a whole week.  After phoning down to the front desk, a lovely lady called Krystal said she would change the rooms over and we were told to stay in the current room for the night, leave our luggage there the next day and when we returned from a day out, the luggage would be moved to another room for us. When we woke up we also found a;4
The New Yorker is an amazing property. It is centrally located and walking distance to Time Square, Macy's, Empire State Building, etc.  If you love historic hotels then you will.love this one. The room was a bit small, but very comfortable. The shower was amazing with great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The bed was extremely comfortable also.  The staff was fantastic also. For my birthday they upgraded us to a room with a view of the Empire State Building and had a bottle of wine brought to the room.   I look forward to returning next year.;5
Stayed here for a conference. The location can’t be beat and the staff and rooms are really nice.;5
Well located toPenn Station, subway stations- this convenient busy hotel is able to accommodate visitors from all countries& do an excellent &professional job to make your visit memorable. Enjoyed the hospitality & XMAS cheer demonstrated at this time of year.;5
Recently stayed here in November. The best thing about this hotel is the location. Opposite Penn Station for the subway, a short walk (19 minutes) to Times Square and Empire State Building. It’s in the middle of Manhattan too which is ideal as it’s not too far to go to the top like Central Park or downtown to the Financial District.  I had booked a Queen room with view and asked for a good view. They put me on floor 37 out of 40 and it had amazing views to wake up to. Room was nice and cleaned daily.  Would return and definitely recommend.;4
Hotel was in a great location, not far from Empire State and Macys. Inside hotel it was viable that they are still doing a lot of renovation work and some floors looked newer than others. Our room was tiny and very basic but to be honest it was clean and we were not in there that much to notice. The tick tock diner connected to the hotel offered amazing breakfasts, so would definitely recommend.;3
Like most things in New York City, The New Yorker Hotel is very tired and in desperate need of an overhaul. Many of the rooms are absolutely tiny with signs of wear and tear everywhere and heating and a/c systems clearly decades old. The impressive art deco roots of this hotel are simply not enough to hide the fact that this hotel just isn’t very good at all.;2
I stay at this hotel for the reasonable rates and the proximity to Penn Station. The lob is large with lots of space to sit, work, charge technology, etc after you check out.  I have been able to check in early both stays. They offer inexpensive bag check if your room is not ready or you are staying after checkout.   They are doing some renovations to the old rooms. Walls and doors are thin, but bed is comfortable. Room is very small but great for the business traveler.;4
Just recently booked a room for myself & my wife at the New Yorker, the lobby looks great since our last stay, price for 2 day stay was ok and very close to Penn Station. The room on the 24th floor was small and I mean small about 140 sq. ft. carpet is worn, fixture in bathroom was broken, walls are paper thin, you can hear everything in the room next to you from talking to flushing the toilet to taking a shower. Clothes closet is too small. Don't open the dresser draw and then try to walk around, can't do it no room. Tried 3x to call the front desk and no one picked up the phone just kept ringing. T.V. stations are limited and some that you do get to watch the color is red. I could go on & on but the best I can do is a poor rating. Website pictures are far different then the;2
Had a wonderful stay here for our 4 night trip to newyork. Room was clean and comfortable,the tick tick diner was brilliant and was open 24 hrs!! Good choice of food and the portions were massive!! Great location walking distance to time square, empire state, rocker fella centre!! Will be back for sure!!!!;4
Frankly I’d never set foot inside this building again. The rooms are tired, tatty, small and dingy. Nothing like the website shows. I could accept this had I not been treated so badly by the front desk manager call Del. I haven’t in a very long time, been treated with such a lack of dignity and respect, by someone in a management position who should know better. Honestly I’d say he’s not fit to sweep the floors of the building. Thanks for ruining my day.;1
Stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker from the 14th to the 19th of December. We had a great stay here the staff were all very polite and very helpful always a good morning/ afternoon with a smile.We were met on the first day by Mohamed on the reception he was so nice and made us feel very welcome he even gave us a free breakfast cause I had gone to NYC for my birthday. The tick tock diner was great we went there every morning the staff again were lovely. I couldn't fault this hotel at all and would highly recommend it as it was very close to Times Square and a lot of attractions, if I ever go to NY again would definatly stay here again....thanks Wyndham hotel for a great stay. Catherine Price ...Wrexham North Wales;5
Very nice hotel in the right location. Lots of attractions plus start of bus tours are walking distance. Very busy hotel but plenty lifts. Rooms are small but very clean and after changing rooms we got the view we paid for of yhe Empire state building;4
Stayed here 16-21 Dec, upgraded on arrival to two adjoining executive rooms. I’ve stayed in more expensive hotels in New York before but the staff here are the friendliest I’ve met. My son had his 13th birthday during our stay and the hotel made it special for him. Will definitely stay here for future visits. The beds are the comfiest I’ve stayed in! Great pizza place opposite hotel. Thank you to all the staff at the New Yorker.;5
Pleasant, professional staff, good restaurants attached, nice Art Deco design. Only negative is carpeting in hallways a little worn/drab and need to have “don’t make up room signs’ for door knob. Mostly quiet rooms with effective temperature control in the room.  Great location near Penn Station/MSG, Macy’s, Javits Center, subway.  The hotel did not serve breakfast, but Tick Tock diner is attached to the hotel.  We ate in the steakhouse attached to the hotel and it was great.;4
While the staff were friendly and attentive to our requests for assistance, the hotel appears to be relying on its history as a very large major hotel in New York The rooms are quite small, we were advised at reception when checking that no rooms have a King bed.  We had to do with a Queen bed for the 6 nights we stayed.\ There was no fridge or tea/coffee making facilities in the room.  There was only one chair that could be used right up next to the bed if one of the two of us wanted to watch TV while the other one had to sit on the bed.  The hotel foyer and hallways on room floors are dated and need brightening up.;3
"First, the positive. Convenient location and a friendly and accommodating  housekeeping staff that promptly responded to a couple of routine requests. Otherwise, not so good. The Queen bed sloped sharply on both sides towards the middle; the bathroom was in major need of retileing and the lines at lobby checkout and check-in were longer than the line outside ""Hello, Dolly."" (Okay, that's an exaggeration). Overall, not a good value.";2
Just back in the UK after a delightful 40th birthday trip to New York with my partner.  Arrived at the hotel and was greeted by a wonderful friendly receptionist who after explaining our terrible transfers (or lack of from airshuttle !)sent up a complimentary bottle of wine to our room. The room was the metro which was clean, great view and everything we needed.  We spoke to a lovely lady at the information desk who gave us information about trips to the Statue of Liberty and advice about how to get around New York.  All the staff we interacted with at the hotel were helpful and friendly and due to the terrible transfer getting to the hotel we booked a hotel car to take us back to JFK. Driver arrived and all went smoothly.   Fantastic hotel and staff and would highly recommend;5
What a lovely hotel. Staff are exceptional friendly. Hotel was clean. Beautiful lobby. Rooms on the small side but that wasn't a problem  We were on the 20th floor and our family were on 30th floor. Wonderful views. The hotel is updated modern bit still got some of the old features.  Great location. 20 minute walk to macys 30 minute walk to times square;5
We have stayed in this hotel before but it was in winter - this time we went in September. The rooms are not very big but are very comfy. The Tick Tock restaurant is brilliant but they give you too much to eat!!;5
The New Yorker was very convenient for my meeting and it was a good value based on my last minute booking.  The room was small but comfortable.;4
"While I have stayed at this hotel four times, I think that my stay with the New Yorker was nicer before Wyndham bought it. It is beginning to look very tired; however, the staff is very efficient and nice.";3
I am a Wyndham Rewards member and paid $50.00 for an early  check-in. She told me that she would give me an upgrade, but instead the room was tiny. I asked for another room and they gave me a slightly better room, but not up to my expectations. I am very disappointed because the last time I visited my room was great.;2
"The hotel is conveniently located just blocks from The Port authority and Penn station. It also was centrally located to all of our destination sites - 911 Memorial, Rockefeller Center and the United nations bulding.  The general appearance of the hotel is grande. We were able to check in at noon. We were pleasantly surprised to have a nice view of the Empire State Building and a distant view of the Chrysler Building.  There were 2 problems with our room. The windows are very drafty (even with the drapes closed). Also, the bathroom paint was peeling on the walls and the tub glaze. Otherwise I would have rated 5 stars. There are signs outside the elevators on a number of floors that apologize for the ""remodeling.""  There was no remodeling being done during our midweek stay.";4
I have stayed at the New Yorker numerous times since 2007.  I stay there by choice due to his convenience to the corporate office of my company.  In 2012 or thereabout I stopped going because I felt the quality was declining.  I started staying at other much pricier hotels  but in 2016 I tried the New Yorker after Wyndham bought it and was it ever excellent.  If you stayed before you really should try it now.;5
We stayed at the New Yorker as we were attending the Andrea Bocelli concert at msg which is right across the street. The check in lines were long but were moving steadily. In order to speed up the process  Reachell offered to check us in at the guest relations desk. After presenting my drivers license she noticed that it was my birthday and said she would be sending something up to the room. She also accommodated us with our room choice and was so pleasant and helpful. Shortly after we settled in guest service delivered to us a bottle of wine and two glasses with a   birthday message from the New Yorker and a handwritten birthday wish from Reachell. It is always nice to see people in customer service that truly enjoy their job are great doing it. Thank you for a memorable;5
Firstly the room I had wasn't cheap, over $1200 for 5 nights (3 staying in the room) so the expectations rise with the price.  The room was spacious for NYC, the beds were comfortable, large fridge free to use, nice coffee machine and free safe to use.The bathroom was large, if a bit tired looking, and the shower wasn't the best but it done the job. The flush makes some racket so be prepared to hear other rooms using theirs during the night. I found the maid service was great for the first two nights then seemed to get rough the last three, no new towels two days in row, no loo roll left one day. Little things that for the price should be taken for granted. The aircon is pretty noisy but can be set really warm if that's what you want.  The wifi in the room was sound, you have to;3
"I paid $650 for 1 night in a family suite and the room was smaller than a regular room. They had the heater at 79 degrees, did when you walked in the room felt muggy and moldy. I called to get my kids sofa bed made, it took over 2 hours for house keeping to come. I had to call and complain 2 times. I was so disappointed. We were excited to eat at the new banker restaurant with the new volt area just opened 3 weeks ago. However, the food was way over priced and nothing great we paid $725 for 2 adults and 2 children. At time of check out we were asked if we enjoyed the free breakfast that we were never told about. When I said ""no I paid $80 for soggy waffles and disgusting boxed eggs"" they didn't care. Unnecessary Lines for everything. I will never stay there again!";1
The New Yorker serves as a hotel, dorm, meeting place and office space. Our daughter was staying in the dorm for the fall semester and we arrived a couple days early as I wanted to see New York decorated for the holidays. We were given an executive room on the 8th floor. This floor has been recently remodeled. The room was very clean. It was on the small side, but honestly you are in New York who stays in there room.  The bed was supposed to be a queen but we believe it was a double. It could have used some updating as we rolled towards the middle of the mattress.  The bathroom was modern but could use a modification of the shower, the shower had a spray hand shower that was at a height of probably over 6 feet. There was nowhere for it to be moved to a shorter height, this made;3
Upgrading to a premium suite for an extra $90 per night was the best decision we have ever made! We stayed in room 3808, which is located on the 38th floor, and is enormous - two bathrooms, a separate living area, and a balcony with unobstructed views over the Empire State Building. Very quiet and peaceful. Location of the hotel was also fantastic and close to everything, including great subway connections. Only negative was during checkout when a staff member tried to double-charge us for the upgrade costs, so be weary of this.;5
I stayed with my daughters for a holiday trip to NYC.    The location is great. It’s very busy this time of year and was extremely cold.   A busy dinner is right next door open 24/7 .   It was difficult getting Uber or a taxi so your best bet is the Subway. Easy ride to Rockefeller Center.   The hotel is within walking distance to Herald Square and if it’s not to cold you can walk to Times Square. The blocks are long though.  We had a double room which was renovated but not the bathrooms. Bathrooms were old but adequate. The beds were comfortable. We had problems with the heat the first night so it was very cold in the room. We were freezing all night. There are no blankets -only a very thin cover.   My other daughter had a King Bed in a renovated room with a newer bathroom. She;4
This hotel is perfectly situated for a stay in New York, you can get to any sight from here via waking, subway or slightly further via taxi. The hotel has a grand reception area but is quite busy, especially in December. It seemed that it had been taken over by fellow Brits! The room although a little small was very comfortable  and had a great view of both the Empire State and Chrysler buildings. We stayed for 3 nights and were very happy with our stay and would return. The only thing that is a little silly is this $10 per night resort fee supposedly to cover Wi-fi and calls? It’s not necessary and didn’t really get it, either drop it or include it in your rates.  All in all a great hotel, we had a very nice stay.;4
I was without WI-FI service for a six-day trip, even though I spent almost three hours on the phone with Tech services.  The WI-FI at Starbuck's across the street worked fine.  This hotel is in need of serious HELP.  The Housekeeping staff was wonderful, but otherwise, I'd look elsewhere.;2
Positives: The hotel is in a great location. The lift attendants and the staff at Tick Tock restaurant were fairly nice. The rooms are very clean  Cons: The room was very small and outdated. The reception staff were appalling.  Too little information given at check in. Questions that were asked were given curt responses that did not provide the correct information. Anything that stopped them rattling through their scripted check in or out speech at pace was frowned upon. They lacked the basic customer service skills. Awful.;3
This is a great hotel and the location is excellent beside Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Station Macy's is also quite close. The staff from Management to Housekeeping is excellent so friendly ans helpful.;5
The location of this hotel is okay, easily walkable to Times Square and near to Penn Station, unfortunately that's where the positives end.   Walked out of the lift to see curtains up with apologies about refurbishing, went into room to find it had no view at all, looked onto other rooms despite asking for a city view.  Customer service was nothing to write home about, asked for information on the area and was given as little info as the staff could manage!  Tried the Tick Tock diner- go elsewhere is my advice.  The food was overpriced, the staff were stressed and unfriendly and we ended up leaving most of the food as inedible.  Our room was in need of refurbishment, cracked tiles and patched up areas in bathroom, when complained was told room would be taken out of circulation;3
Hard to perfectly rate this one. If I could, a 3.5 this time. The positives are a brilliant location, a historical building, good staff and overall convenience. Cool and decent diner connected to it which is open 24/7. Useable business longue. Views were great. It is a perfectly fine hotel for shorter stays in my opinion. If you want to feel you are really on vacation, the high-volume of hotel traffic will not provide that feeling. Tons of rooms and 6 elevators! Takes a while to get up and down. Elevator guards to check your room key reminds you this is located in a busy place where you gotta keep an eye out for floaters and belongings. While I was appreciative of a penthouse upgrade (would def get this room again), the water pressure was low and drainage was horrible. Sadly not;3
This was my first trip to NYC and I couldn't have wished for a better hotel! The location is fantastic next to Penn Station and close to Times Square. The 'backroom' staff (especially Emily) were very helpful and responsive to queries prior to our arrival. The reception, bell and security staff were friendly, professional and efficient. The Italian and American diner restaurants attached to the hotel served delicious food. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Check out was easy (a letter through our door with the correct charges allowed us to just drop off our key cards instead of queuing). The only minor issue we had was the room was not available for us when we arrived at 4.30pm however the reception staff dealt with this by ensuring our bags were looked after free;5
I booked a queen room with a view. When I arrived I was given a room that can only be described as tatty. No view, a mattress that had me sink down to the box spring, and a gaping hole in the windows that let in freezing outside air. I went downstairs and received the room I think I paid for- a decent, but not amazing view, and a bed and room in better condition.   The hallways smell really bad.  Overall, the hotel has a feeling of being run down and catering to mass tourism.   I chose this hotel because of its Art Deco heritage but frankly, you can see lol there is to see from the outside. The interior does not offer much else.   Also, the rates they advertise are not the rates you pay. They add a $30 'facility fee' which is mandatory and really just a way to lure you in with a;3
Our overall impression of The Wyndham New Yorker Hotel exceeded our expectations.  Excellent location and the subway is right there so you can get anywhere in the city rather quickly.  The staff was courteous and professional at all times.  Very enjoyable!;5
From the initial moment we arrived we were extremely happy with the New Yorker. It’s amazing Art Deco decor and features was what attracted us to it and this never failed to deliver WOW  ... fabulous features throughout.  The staff were helpful and efficient and the hotel was in a perfect location to reach everywhere and everything we wanted to experience either by foot or on the  metro. On arrival our bags were stored allowing us to explore and we were pre- registered ready for check in when our room was ready. the security at this hotel was great with passes being checked to prevent access to rooms by non residents and we were given temp pass to use the lower lobby rest rooms while we waited for our room to be ready.  We were visiting for my 50th birthday and were given a;4
This hotel is really centrally located for many major attractions in NYC such as Macy's and the Empire State Building. However, the hotel room needed major upgrades... First, another family we were there with found an empty beer can in their room which is obviously doesn't make you feel like the best cleaning job was done. Our room had chipped molding and dim lighting. The bed was not very comfortable. Also the room was not spacious but that is expected for NYC. The lobby was nice and the diner in the lobby was convenient and pretty good.;3
The room was beautiful, we got upgraded to a nicer room upon arrival.  The view was amazing, and for those who said it was too loud, it is not loud, couldn't hear anything except a firetruck at one point.  I couldn't ask anymore out of a hotel.  The surrounding area is awesome and the pizza place across the street was perfect!  I'll be coming back here next time.  Room was also very clean and smelled great!;5
I travelled with my two young nieces and we found the location of the hotel excellent for all we wanted to do and see in the city. It was a great base to walk or jump on the subway and given we did some intercity travel by train, the proximity to Penn Station was fantastic. The facade and decor of the hotel is lovely but we did find the bathroom a little on the small side, though recently renovated and very clean. We also found our room quite quiet given the busy location but overall we'd happily stay here again.;4
We stayed for 7 nights and our room was just big enough for two which I believe is normal for NYC. You have to ask for a coffee maker as there are no kettles but be persistent as it’s our experience that it will not arrive after the first time of asking! The room was cleaned promptly every day and being on the 19th floor did not preclude the street noise from keeping you awake at all hours. Also fellow guest were always talking loudly as they passed your room so sleep was often interrupted, but that is probably part of the New York experience? We had the feeling that as we booked via a UK travel agent and paid in advance to get the best price we were given the “less good room” - didn’t want to say the worst room as it was adequate and we only slept there (or tried to)! The;3
The New Yorker just keeps getting better.  New Vault Steakhouse in the basement gives a nice option and has great food.  Of course the Tick Tock is perfect after a late night in the city.  Guest services is great from top to bottom.;5
Hotel is a great location however staff at reception pretty unhelpful and not interested if complaints. Rooms are very small and basic no facilities to make a drink, no fridge, decor tired. Biggest complaint was on running a bath filthy brown scummy water, which did not clear!! Reported to reception they were not interested! Toiletries ok but no shower gel. Hotel dies have some beautiful Art Deco features;2
Stayed here for the 6th time and even better this year as the room had been fully refurbished with a Great view of the Empire State, Lovely clean and spacious room. Staff were so welcome, Tick Tock was always quick efficient service with lovely food. You could not get a better location. So central. Can’t wait to return again same time next year.;5
"This summer I stayed at this hotel with a friend and our children. It was a fantastic combo package that include tickets to the Empire State Bldg and free breakfasts. We were on the 34th floor with a great view. Loved every minute of it. Two weeks ago I brought my husband and son back to enjoy the Christmas season in NYC. At check-in my husband was told that we were being given an ""upgraded"" room seeing as though we were returning guests....terrific. We were put on the 8th floor with a view of a brick wall in a small room with an extremely small bathroom. The bowl sink looked nice but the water drained slowly and the bowl was so shallow that it very quickly could have overflowed. The shower was awkwardly built so that you had to stand in the shower completely to be able to reach";2
across the street from MSG, very convenient if travelling using the subway. Walking distance to macy, highline times square. lots of restaurants and bars in area. for a new York hotel, rooms very spacious.;4
My friend and I went to NYC. The Wyndham New Yorker was a fine place to stay. It has some of the old character as it was built in 1929 (refurbished tastefully). It has a 24/7 restaurant (The Tick-Tock) connected for easy access with reasonable prices. Some of you may like big tall hotels and this one was good don't get me wrong. Just remember  that you wait by the elevators for your ride and you pick up others along the way down and up...so when you forget to bring your gloves you go all the way back through the wait to get them. The service was good. the front desk helped us get a much needed cork screw...no problem. Our room had a great view of the Empire State Building (#2145). It was a good place to stay. To save money you can go directly to the Hop on Hop Off Bus Tour folks;4
The hotel from the outside is spectacular and gives that 1920 new york feeling that tourist and business man look for when staying in the City.  Bedrooms however are a bit dated and when I stayed over (january) they had a little bit of a draft.  I would reccomend it for short stays and not for prolonged sejours  Davide;3
The New Yorker is fabulously located for exploring New York City. The Art Deco feel is fabulous however the hotel is tired in places. It’s quite clear the hire does bulk rather than quality but having said that we barely spent a moment in the room. The hotel is attached to a diner which is a little over priced but serves its purpose well. Overall would return and recommend this hotel.;4
We booked through BA in addition to our flights and arrived on a busy Saturday evening. Lots of people seem to complain that the rooms are small. We were given an upgraded room without any real effort when we asked if we had a view. We stayed in room 3904 which had a coffee machine and a fridge and was a fairly good sized room. The room was clean and comfortable and was serviced each morning in the time it took us to get breakfast. All of the staff were more than happy to help with whatever you needed and the presence of security at the lift lobby provided extra reassurance that only those that needed to get past reception did. The on site Tick Tock Dinner is open 24 hours and is great for a quick meal or breakfast. The Hells Kitchen area is only a few minutes walk along 8th;5
I just arrived but I am already enjoying my stay. What's better than grabbing a lamb gyro and a nice hot shower after a 4.5 hour flight and 1.5 to 2 hour bus ride (including wait and transfers) from JFK. The room is small but probably average size for NYC. I think the only thing it is missing is a mini refrigerator.  I really appreciate the price for a stay at the New Yorker as well as the location. I took the NYC Airporter from JFK. Their rep told me to take the bus from JFK to Grand Central Station, but he was wrong. The best spot for this hotel is Penn station. If you're not in a rush, it's about $36 Roundtrip. I booked this hotel stay through Cancelon via TripAdvisor's website and was ableto modify it within 5 days prior to my trip. I was very happy with their ability to;4
"We stayed four nights at the New Yorker.  We had booked a room on-line; hotel rooms in Manhattan are very pricey.  The room (the first night) was tiny, the closet smelled like mildew, the TV didn't work properly and I had a stained towel!  That evening, Ruben fixed our television.  The next  morning, I spoke with Onnelia at the front desk.  She upgraded our room.  She explained that the rooms booked on-line via companies such as Expedia, Hotels.com are these very small rooms (so small, you couldn't open a dresser drawer or closet door without hitting the bed).  Fortunately, the remainder of our stay was very comfortable.  The hotel is near Penn Station which was great for my husband who had to get to Newark for meetings.  It also convenient to subway and bus lines.  Thanks again";4
Lots of noise and a very small room.  Dont expect much sleep you hear everything from water running to toilets flushing.;3
Booked the basic room for a three night stay.   Rooms were very small, as expected, but clean and comfortable. Bed and linens were very nice.   Bathroom was pretty small but adequate.  The hotel itself was very nice ,  check in quick, staff very polite and friendly.  Convenient to two subway lines, so it was easy to commute.  Would recommend;4
We had a very nice room which was larger than expected and we were very happy to stay there. No issues except the windows in the room let in a bit of a breeze, but the hotel is old. Good location if you want to stay in midtown and do lots of walking/getting the subway. Not many amazing places to eat nearby but subway is next to the hotel. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Would have no hesitation recommending this hotel.;4
This was my second stay at the New Yorker hotel in one year. Mr Miguel and Ms Nayab (both staff members at the check in counter) promised me to reimburse the facility fee of USD 29 per night but somehow I still got charged. During the check out, I addressed this issue and Ms Shamagne said she will asked Mr Miguel and Ms Nayab if this was true. They would come in at 3 pm and I would already be flying back home. Ms Shamagne wrote down my e-mail address and phone number and promised to get back at me. She never did, even though I asked her two times before leaving the hotel!!! It’s really unpleasant to deal with unreliable staff, especially when you are there for a short perioud and trying to enjoy the city.   I had to solve this issue when I came back to the Netherlands.;3
Walking into the hotel lobby was very impressive.  Checkin: quick and easy.  Room: huge - two double beds, two bathrooms, two closets.  More than adequate. nIn room safe.    Lifts: There are separate lifts for floors 1-20 and 21 up.  The lifts are very quick.  Concierge:  Booked a helicopter flight with them.  Couldn't get us in with the one company on the day we wanted but got us in with another company.  Location: perfect!  Close to Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building, Times Square, etc.  We walked absolutely everywhere which I think is the best way to see New York.  Checkout: very easy and quick.  Staff:  Very friendly and helpful.;4
Stayed at New York Wyndom for three nights. Some renovation work in progress. Room typical New York small but clean and adequate. Reception staff business like no friendly chit chat when checking in or out. Plenty of security staff on doors and lift entrance. Very small lobby for such a big hotel. Tick tock diner open 24/7. Italian Restaurant on ground floor nice clean and modern staff friendly and plenty to choose from on the menu. Would not go back to this Hotel a bit too long a walk to Times Square for my liking and didn't feel comfortable in that area. Lots of street litter, poor homeless people trying to get a sleep/heat from street steam vents and begging for monies for food or cigarettes;3
Before we flew to Italy from New York we stayed at another hotel down the street and was less than impressed. When we got back from Italy we stayed at The New Yorker and it exceeded our expectations. When we first went to check in, there was huge team in the lobby so we had to wait in line to check in. As we were waiting a lady from the Members Check-In called us over. We mentioned that it was our honeymoon and she tried to upgrade our room to one with a view. She didn't have any open so she gave us a meal certificate for free breakfast. It was so nice and thoughtful. She did not have to do that. She also signed us up as Members (no fee). The room was nice. It was quite small but thats not unusual for a Manhattan hotel. The view was still pretty cool and I loved the old fixtures;5
We paid a lot to stay here and I was disappointed with the size of the room. The bathroom was certainly 2 star. The bed was lovely to sleep in, there was a lot of noise from the street and from other hotel guests. The staff were nice a friendly and the place was very tidy. We had no view to speak of but the hotel is in a prime spot for touring.;3
Booked by our travel agent, we were looking forward to our stay. On arrival we asked if we could have a room with a view, but were given a very small room overlooking a utility area with window cleaning gantry, and no view of the city. Just one dressing gown, blocked sink requiring replacement, and very thin walls so disturbed by adjoining bathrooms. Quite glad to check out.;3
Every time I go to New York I stay here , Central Location as it’s near everything Friendly Staff and the place is spotless Clean and Safe , Good speed internet Highly Recommended if your on a shopping trip as there is a Weighing scales there;5
I stayed in the New Yorker for 3 nights.   My room had been renovated and was nice with plenty of room.   My co-workers however, were on a floor that had not been updated.   There room was not as nice as mine, but all were fine considering the amount of time we were actually at the hotel.   The location is very convenient to Macy's and Madison Square Garden.   There is a cafe connected to the hotel for a quick bite to eat.  There is also a CVS, McDonald's and Starbucks across the street.  I also appreciated the hotel checking for room keys before allowing anyone up the elevators to the floors with guests' rooms.;4
Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at end of November.  Everything was great.  Driss, one of the receptionists, was very helpful to our party.  The Tic Toc diner, although not particularly cheap, always produced very good food.  Location of the hotel was great.  Just a short walk to Macys and Empire State Building.  Rooms were good although one of ours was not really big enough for two beds and possibly 4 people sharing.  Would definitely go back again;5
This would have being my third time in Nee York and my partners first so I had an idea of hotels which were central but also nice, I stayed in The New York before and couldn’t recommend it enough! The rooms are clean and towels changed everyday, the Tick Tock restaurant is a nice little spot for food and the staff are lovely! Everything is in walking distance and including the Subway, Madison Square Gardens, Macy’s, The Empire State, Time Square the list goes on! It’s close to restaurants like TGI Friday’s and McDonald’s, they have also opened up a new restaurant in the vault of the hotel which is called the Banker & the butcher the food is amazing too, it was my birthday while we were there and there was wine in the room which was a nice touch! If I was to go back to New York I;5
This is a fantastic hotel room spotless housekeeping very friendly. We stayed in room 3904 (1st December to the 5th December) the lady who cleaned our room was a happy friendly lady she really took care of us and did her job to a high standard. The girls on reception were all fantastic and very helpful I would highly recommend going to this hotel.;5
Our room was directly next to the elevators--which we heard day and night. Others talked of hearing the sirens of emergency vehicles day and night. On 20th floor and above as well as lower.;3
"We have recently returned from a 5 night stay at The New Yorker Hotel; the highlight of the Hotel is the excellent location. 5-8 minute work from both Times Square and The Empire State builing, and just a block away from Macy's!  A 24 hour McDonalds is opposite the hotel, aswell as a star bucks; there is also a CVS opposite too which is really useful.  The hotel lobby is quite grand, and the staff helpful. The check in process was relatively quick.  We were on the 21st floor which was great, because there are 2 sets of lifts; 1 set services floors upto 20 and the other set which serves 21 onwards. Being on floor 21 meant we were the first stop.  The room itself; it was quite small, however this is New York and that is the norm. The bed was quite comfortable and the room was";4
My room was not just small but tiny. Also my view was a wall. I had no real place to rest my bag without blocking my ability to get around. Also my suit and dress shirts did not fit in the closet. The check in took for ever and I even had to wait for check out. The room had one nice touch of a nespresso. Also the bed was comfortable. For almost $400 per night I would have expected more.;3
The Wyndham is an old style hotel in a perfect location.  It was very convenient to Penn Station, Macys, and all the attractions of Times Square and the Theatre District.  When I arrived I was quickly accommodated and informed I had been given a free upgrade to a suite!  The room was amazing and had a fantastic view of New York.  The elevators were fast and the staff very accommodating.  Overall it was a great stay.;5
We LOVED our stay at the New Yorker. We had insane views from the top floor and loved being able to see the Empire State Building from our room! The hotel is walkable to broadway, shopping, and Penn Station. You could literally walk of a train, check into your hotel, and be at a show within and hour. The original art deco architecture and interior is stunning.;5
I liked the Wyndham hotel, because is near of principals turistics points of New York. The room was good and clean, about breakfast, so you are in New York then you should find out a place for eating natural food.;4
Stayed at the New Yorker as we often have.  They didn't disappoint.  We were there twice on the 30th floor and on the 23rd floor with corner rooms and lovely views of the Empire State building and Madison Square Garden.  I think paying for the upgrade to the suites for the location of the rooms, the floors, and the space is the way to go at this hotel.  The mid-town location next to all mass transportation is perfect for business and for tourism.;5
So we arrived at the Whyndam New Yorker  and the first feeling walking in was Comfort , friendly , Clean , Safety,  Then we met Mohammed who checked us in he was lovely i  asked him if we could have a room with a View of the city so he did his best and gave us a room with a View which was beautiful , Mohammed told us a bit about the Hotel which was Interesting and my Daughter knew all about what he was telling us. He explained where everything was , computer room, Gym , Diner which was opened 24hours and trust me you will be glad at 4 or 5 in the morning when jet lag gets hold of you , and you don't know if you want to order Breakfast or a Burger but you can  order what you like it's a great place to eat , staff so friendly . The Room was your basic hotel room double bed TV what;4
We arrived around 3 pm.  Check-in took a while, but our room was ready.  Although the room is small, it's Manhattan, so we didn't expect a lot of square footage, and we knew we would just sleep in the room.  The bedroom and bathroom were spotless and very nicely decorated.  Elevators were fast.  The Tic Toc Diner was great for breakfast and lunch!  The location is perfect.  We were able to walk to Times Square and lots of shopping and dining.  We'll be back!;5
Was my first time to stay at The New Yorker Hotel.Location is great, right beside pen station Two minute walk to Macey's and Port Authority plus st. Patrick's cathedral,Professional Excellent staff 👍;5
Service was good.  The room was good and clean . Nice amenities.  Beds were ok for 1 night . Pillows were good. 2 bathrooms in room with 2 double beds was a definite plus. Hotel was central to many attractions.  Great location.;4
We booked a suite online and no room was ready when we arrived. They said to come back at 4:30 and when we did we were told no suites available and we got 2 rooms instead. This was a girls trip for a special occasion and we wanted to be together. Staff was nice as there was nothing they could do but management was less then helpful. We definitely felt like we didn't matter and management did not care that they screwed up. They treated like we were some annoying teenagers not the 30s something professional adults that we are. We could have booked a suite at a million other NYC hotels instead. The rooms were ok - clean but tiny and outdated. Staff in the diner and the nicer restaurant in the lobby were very nice. Bell staff and valet were also great. Overall it wasn't bad but;3
Voyage Price offered The New Yorker suggesting it is a four star hotel. We were so disappointed we checked out after one night. The staff on reception are shoddily dressed , the carpets grubby , the rooms tiny ( and we were upgraded ) the beds small with cheap , thin bedding. The hotel was swarming with students when we stayed  , so lots of noise in the corridors and queues for the lifts and reception etc It’s very definitely a budget hotel;2
Nasty, dirty rooms. I have never been on a hotel where I have felt so disgusted... similar maybe only to a youth hostel in Europe or Brazil. Lobby and staff were nice though and the location was great. But not worth it. Thankfully it was only one night... Never again.;1
Visted New York in September with my daughter for sightseeing & shopping. The hotel is ideally placed opposite Maddison Square Gardens at the corner of 34th & 8th. Everything in New York is walkable and you are only a short walk to Times Square, the Empire State & the Rockafella Centre.  The hotel is an iconic art deco building so rooms are old fashioned but clean and spacious. As this was a bitrhday celebration trip we were upgraded to a large 2 bathroom & 2 double bedded room. Note that plugs in the room are limited so we bought an extension lead. The hotel also gave us a free late checkout until 3pm, which was great as we had evening return flights. Staff were friendly & helpful.;4
Great hotel, good location,  friendly staff but way too small a room, I couldn’t move around not to talk of play around with the Mrs.. and I recall asking for a big room. Not very happy. The only bonus is that the hotel is right in the middle of everything and just a walking distance to Time square.;3
Recently renovated rooms, very clean. Great view of Empire State Building and small terrace adjoining room. Very friendly and helpful staff. Great midtown location, walking distance to Times Square, Theater district. Madison Square Gardens and Penn station. Subway nearby.;4
A great art deco hotel with some fabulous views of the Empire state building and Hudson river dependent on the room. We had a room on the 37th floor with a view of the Empire state building. The room was great with a small cudboard/wardrobe space attached ensuite bathroom with bath and shower over the bath. We were provided with a coffee machine for the room and had pre-ordered a bottle of champagne as the occasion was a 50th birthday trip. The hotel is going through an upgrade at present due to its age but doesn't take away from the stay as  the rooms were fine if a little tired in places but doesn't advertise as 5* so no issues there. Great location as almost next to Penn station for trains and subway and next to Madison square garden. The hotel has lots of amenities but;5
If this hotel would be anywhere outside Manhattan it would probably not get even 2 stars from me.  The staff is the worst feature of this place. Most of them, not all, are rude,  New York style rude.  This is upsetting. Rooms are small and dark.  Bathroom is from the 60's if not earlier, and water temp. is not stable, one of the most annoying things that a hotel can have. The lobby is as hectic as the Penn station on a Friday afternoon, hundreds of people just walk in and out and around the lobby. certainly not a place to relax. They have about 1500 rooms, and it is not an intimate place, as one can imagine, and will not  give you any relaxation from the craziness and noise of midtown Manhattan outside the doors. Having said all that, the location is a winner, just a few blocks;3
swift check in and out, lovely staff throughout hotel.  Room was clean, air con could be used to heat up or cool down room. Loved having a dinning table and chairs.  We had a bedroom and sitting room with a fold away bed, allowed our party of 5 to sit and talk while eating and planning.  Beds were very comfortable, maid always had our rooms looking immaculate on our return from a day out.  Safe available for use in the room,you select your pin number while using it, very convenient.  Didn't eat at the tick tock on this occasion but have before and food is really good.  Lots of places to eat and drink nearby, mcdonalds is right across the road and did not have any problems taking food into hotel.  There is a coffee shop in the hotel, we were cheaper at mcdonalds but it is very;5
Recently returned from a four night break at this hotel. Flew into Newark Airport and used the train to get to Penn Station. $13.00 ea, kids were $3.00 each. The hotel was just across the road from the station. Easy to get to.  We arrived just after 2pm and tried to check in, however our room wasn’t ready, but no problem, the receptionist pointed us in the direction of a local pub, and gave us a 10% discount card. All good.   Went back at around 4pm. Was looked after by Mohammad. The room was still not ready. Mohammad swung into action, and with a couple of quick calls, we were sorted! Couldn’t have asked for more!   To be honest, the floor we were on looked a bit tired, as did the rooms, but they were fine. (I get the impression that Wyndham are in the process of renovating it);4
I found the room kind of small. Yet I was told this is completely typical of a hotel in a big city. It was very clean and the staff was always pleasant. The bathroom in my opinion needed updated. It could have been updated and yet kept its older charm. I would definitely stay here again!;4
I would stay at this hotel the next time I'm in New York.  A young lady named Megan provided the best customer service to us and many other guest everyday with a smile.;5
The first time at The New Yorker was in May 2016 for two nights.  The second time was the whole Thanksgiving week of 2017.  We chose TNY because it was in the Garment District and this is a relatively quiet part of NYC.  It is a short walk to Macy’s and Time Square.  We walked back to the hotel one night after seeing a Broadway play right through Time Square and it only took about 15-20 minutes.  We stopped along the way and took pictures.  Very safe walking back with lots of tourists and residents.  The hotel has The Tick Tock Diner which is great if you are in a hurry to eat breakfast and get out and start sight seeing.  There is also a bar and restaurant if you are tired at the end of the day and want a low key meal.  We ate at both places.  There are also lots of other great;5
Stayed here for 4 nights.  Great location,  helpful staff and very comfortable rooms.  The hotel is within walking distance to the flagship Macy's store. I will definitely stay at this hotel again when I return to NY;4
This a wonderful hotel with the most comfortable beds 5* and great facilities. Free calls home to UK, I asked and within minutes had a tea and coffee maker in the room. The staff are universally lovely but I would pick out reception, the maid service and our favourite person John the concierge - such a nice man and very helpful, makes you feel so welcome. Security at the hotel is excellent. I have said that this is a md range hotel in terms of price but to us it is a luxury experience. Great location for getting anywhere in Manhattan - we used the subway and it was perfect, re food the Tick Tock Diner is brilliant, the unassuming Familgia Italian restaurant opposite is excellent as is Delmonico's Kitchen on 36th between 7th and 8th - nothing unassuming there but the best steak;5
We absolutely loved our stay at the New Yorker! It truly felt like home, it was hard to leave. Great location, friendly staff, clean facility and best of all, very comfortable room with a great view! Our family has all decided that we’d love to stay there next time we go back and would love to stay in the same room.;5
Just came back from staying at The Wyndham New Yorker in NYC, a lovely hotel! The staff are friendly, helpful & very smart. We had a great view of the Empire State Building & Madison Square Garden I’ve noted the room numbers for next time!! I would recommend staying here as it’s central but not enough to be overly busy. The lobby is stunning with the new blending very well with the old.;5
Beside the great location of the hotel the staff is very freindly and helpful as well. I had to re-adress the receipt of my stay and Fabiole from the morning shift was just the person I needed to solve my problem. Thank you!;5
We arrived at the hotel yesterday afternoon. What a beautiful entrance. Helpful staff on the desk and throughout the lobby. All looked to be going well for our first ever trip to New York.  Our room is on the 29th floor. As you leave the elevator you are met with a sign saying they are having work done and to bear with them, work in the rooms is needed as they are a little dated. Got to our room which is on the small side but didn’t bother me and went straight to check our room view as our travel operator had requested a room with a view due to it being my birthday week. My view is of an office block, not what I expected. There is no facilities to make hot drinks in the room so we purchased a couple bottles of water for when we went back to our room.;4
We stayed at the New Yorker for 4 days over thanks giving, and we're very happy with the hotel.The staff were all friendly and welcoming and we found no queues at reception with a speedy checking in and out process. We were given a room on the 26th floor and could see the top of the Empire State from our window. The lobby and entrance area at the hotel is amazing, but the hallways to your rooms are looking tired and are due to be modernized. Our room was fine and comfortable and large enough , again it could do with being updated now but I think that's part of the charm. I would stay here again if we returned to NYC, as its nearby all the sights including Macy's and Times Square.;4
Great Hotel.  We were able to check in early, which really helped.  Room was much bigger than expected, and very quiet. We needed a rollaway bed, and all I had to do is make a phone call.  The diner was delicious and very convenient.;5
We stay at this hotel due to being in the parade on Thanksgiving.  They are very accomodating for checking out since we are in the parade.  They are very helpful and it is normal price range since you are in NY.;4
Stayed at The New Yorker Hotel over Thanksgiving holiday.  One downside, on Thanksgiving morning - 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. the bands practice in front of Macys, which is one block away, and you can hear the music.  Other than that, the hotel is old, but being updated.  Our room was small, but very comfortable, the bathroom could use a little more counter space, but other than that a great hotel to stay at.  The staff from the doorman, front desk staff, security, and housekeeping are wonderful.  Made you fell so special.  Also, the water pressure in the shower was fabulous, and hot. Will stay there again.;4
Beautiful looking hotel in the 1930’s style  this our third stay at this hotel and find the location great for our purpose which is sight seeing and being central it’s great for trips up or downtown  The hotel didn’t serve breakfast but the Tick Tick diner attached to the hotel will serve you any breakfast you need  I find the gym facilities are very good located just below the reception  The rooms are nice  and clean we’ve always had a good view but to be honest you’re in New York so the room should be the place you’d be spending the least amount of time in;4
I took bed bugs home with me from this hotel location. Took me 2 months to get rid of them. I had to buy a new mattress, bed frames, bedding, pillows, The establishment didn't even comp my room. Very disappointed in the negligence of hygiene, in addition to the poor customer service. Please proceed with caution.;1
This hotel is just beautiful, from the time you walk in the lobby seeing the massive chandelier,tiled floor and brass elevators. The staff are so friendly they really can't do enough for you. We had a Queen room which is very adequate for the time we stayed. The rooms aren't massive but I wasn't planning on staying in my room all day. There is an on suite ,closet with iron and ironing board. There's a good quality tv ,telephone in your room with free international phone calls, yes you read that right FREE. The bed was extremely comfortable. Air con in our room, would expect it in the others as well. Maisonette Square gardens just over the road, Empire state building within walking distance. This hotel is very central. Tick tock diner is located  downstairs. It's a typical;5
Some of the terraces on the 38th floor feature an outdoor table with chairs. Ours was strewn with scaffolding, cables, and yellow caution tape (for our safety I suppose). The skyline views were spectacular. We always stay here when visiting family. The rooms are clean, staff is friendly, and there is 24 security personnel checking room keys at the lobby elevators. Love this place!!;5
The entrance is unique and really nice, however when enter the room it feels like you gone to jail. The rooms are very small and not up to an acceptable standard at all. The best part of this hotel is the location. I won't come back!;2
Loved this hotel.  Real art deco hotel with a great history.  Tick tock diner attached was fab.  Lovely fun staff open 24hrs.  Security was good had to show room key to access lifts which i think was a great idea and made you feel safe.  8th avenue great location to get all major attractions and subway blue line took us from just outside hotel to central park getting off just outside dakota building one way or straight down to ground zero memorial the opposite way.  Hotel room had to queen beds and fantastic view ample room for two adults and teenager.  Would recommend a stay at the new yorker to anyone.  Visit the high line fantastic way to see new york fantastic city, and can't wait to go again wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again.;5
This hotel needs modernisation, the rooms are small and the bathrooms are even smaller. The rooms are clean which is a plus. The staff are friendly but as with a lot of hotels in the USA there aren’t many amenities. No room service, no coffee facilities . It’s quite close to Time Square only a short walk which is good. If asked if I would come back to this hotel , I wouldn’t!;4
The best hotel I’ve stayed in, in New York. Everything on its doorstep ha, lovely staff so helpful, my room was clean and a brilliant view. Go see John (he should be in the movies😉 you will see what I mean when you meet him a true gentleman) for your ride back to the airport he will sort everything. 5+star hotel for me and my daughter we will be back for sure ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️;5
We stayed here primarily because of the proximity of the hotel to Penn station.  Being directly across the road from Penn was perfect for us as it made arriving from JFK and also heading out to Metlife very straight forward.  It's also in a great location to walk to anything in Manhattan.  The rooms were small, basic but clean and comfortable with everything that we would need for our stay.;5
"We stayed in a suite on the 32nd floor for three nights. The front  doorman, the front desk staff, the baggage check staff, and especially the housekeeping staff was great! Very kind and accommodating. The room itself was small, but clean and in the classic style of decades ago...which is not my own preference, but the ""throwback"" atmosphere made it feel like old New York, so while the room wasn't up-to-date and modern, it was comfortable and a place to rest. One negative was that the drains in the bathroom sink and tub were slow, so water backed up into the sink/tub...of which I informed the front desk upon checkout. The location is awesome, close to shopping (Macy's and 5th Avenue is within walking distance) and close to Times Square and the Empire State Building. The attached";4
The hotel is located opposite Penn station and only a block away from Macys & the Empire State Building It is a lovely Art Deco Building which has been well renovated  There are two restaurants on the ground floor, Bianca an Italian restaurant and a great deli called Tick Tock This restaurant is open all hours ,has an extensive menu and the food and service are both very good  We had stayed at the hotel before and this time our room was very small. The Queen bed was almost against the wall and it was a squeeze to get around it at the bottom The bathroom was adequate with a good power shower  Service was excellent with all staff being friendly & helpful;4
The people were wonderful, the room was clean and comfortable, and everything there helped make a great weekend in Manhattan!  Checking in was very easy and having the restaurant right next to the lobby was perfect.  The art and history of the building in the lower level was very interesting and everyone should take a few minutes to see that.;5
like most hotels in new York rooms a bit small bathroom small but clean and comfy not great on a views unless you get higher floor we were on the 7th and no view.    so request above 19th floor.     restaurant at lobby and subway close by all you will do is sleep here anyway so not much time in room.;4
Stayed for 4 nights. We were Upgraded at check in. Bottle of complimentary sparkling wine left in the room for my birthday. Very friendly and helpful staff. Room very clean and modern. Little bit small but didn’t need it any bigger as we didn’t spend much time in our room. Butcher and banker restaurant in the hotel is way over priced. Was expecting a lot more for what we paid.;4
Air BNB or hotel? Good question. At least with a hotel you pretty much know what you're going to get. Location is spectacular, convenient to trains, Times Square, Madison Square Gardens, Empire State Building, etc. Hotel was very gracious upgrading our room when the 'view' room we initially got was less than expected. Cleaning staff our very gracious, concierge was helpful, information desk did their job.  Recommend bucking up for the continental breakfast, Mon-Fri it's in the hotel and supplies you with everything you need to kick start your day. Weekends at the adjoined diner isn't as good but it worked as a basic start. Worth it!;5
Spacious, very comfortable room, great new shower. All employees from greeter to bellhops to check in registrar to housekeeping to taxi procurer were very nice and helpful. Special shout-out to Jose at check in who made sure we got into a renovated room and were pleased with it. He was very professional, kind and worked hard to make everything as good as it could be for us.  We had a fantastic trip to NYC, much of it to do with our hotel stay!;5
Just checked out, room was a strange shape and so the furniture didn’t actually fit properly in the room making it a bit awkward. Bathroom was very small and while I know it’s going for an Art Deco vibe, the place really seems dated. We could hear a crying baby most of the first night we were staying there. Not a very friendly staff, people sort of look past you when they speak. Ate at the diner several times for convenience. Food was good, service is terrible! Can’t beat the convenience to Penn Station and MSG. I’d probably look around a bit more, especially since it’s not the cheapest place in the neighborhood.;2
I stayed here during a brief trip to NYC.  Overall I was satisfied.  The hotel is huge which means lots of people coming and going.  The property seems popular with all kinds of groups - both conventions and schools.  The location is good - right at Penn Station.  Access to the extensive subway system is right there.  Public transportation to/from JFK is super easy and cheap - $7.75 with the subway, a little more with the LIRR.  I echo the comments made by Maddykimba.  The room was nice enough - not huge by any means but reasonable by New York standards.  The bathroom was cramped but manageable.  The water temperature was erratic - scalding or freezing and rarely in between.  You're constantly trying to adjust the temperature without success.  There are some renovations going on;3
Great location for NYC just a couple of blocks from Macy’s and next to Penn station.  Not a lot more to say, rooms were nice but do need updating, hotel did not offer much else, like i said the location is perfect but for the price I would have expected better rooms and amenities;3
Small, good for what I needed it for and close to MSG and One Penn Plaza (For Business) Not sure the price is worth paying for but those are typical NYC rates and you will find that everywhere. The room I had was clean so I would stay here again.;4
Excellent location!! Right across the street from penn station, Madison Square Garden, an avenue away from herald square and around 5 blocks south of Time square! We took the subway everywhere bc each stop was close to the hotel!! The lobby is very nice and vintage NY hotel. They explained they were remodeling floors and they placed us on a remodeled floor. The floor and room are modern, other floors are very vintage. My husband put it “like walking into the titanic.”  The room is literally one queen bed, barely enough space for the small desk, no refrigerator (but upon request will bring it in and they didn’t even know where to fit it), and just enough space to walk around to the other side. There is a flat screen tv attached to the wall.  The bathroom is small as well. A;4
I love staying here.  This property is so close to Penn Station, no cab necessary!  Also, if you're going to a show at Madison Square Garden, it's right there.  I consider it 'home base' while in New York City (Manhattan at least);5
Stayed over after a concert at MSG. Perfect location, just across the street. Make sure to book a remodeled room.;4
I stayed here a few night with my boyfriend! I can tell you it was noisy, in a way that you really don't want to. Yes we heard the couple next door.. it has a beautiful view the higher up you get, but with the amount of hotels in the city I would pick another hotel.;2
The location is great, The room is nice, Not to big, but fine for one person with a queen room.  The bathroom was small but I can live with that.  The shower Sucked.  The shower head was awful and the water keep going cold and hot , never stayed a good temp for more then a minute.   I would stay there again.  Clean and friendly.;4
We visited for our annual US trip. Here's my review  Check in: 4.5/5. While there's a queue when we arrived at noon, check in was easy and experience is good when you add in the warmth of the front office ladies.  Room: 4.5/5. We got a standard queen room. No complaints. Not having a refrigerator isn't even an issue. Who needs it when there's food everywhere. There's a McDonald's and Starbucks across the street when you have late night or early morning need for food or coffee. The room is clean.  Property: 5/5. There's history in this hotel. Nikola tesla stayed here at the 33rd floor during his last days. The art deco building and the interiors don't look old for me, it added to the charm of the hotel. Location is amazing.

I️ A young man named Driss waited on me and was exceptional.  Thank you for making my check in exceptional.;5
The hotel is is perfectly placed to take in all that New York has to offer with most of midtown Manhattans attractions and land marks in easy walking distance. The staff are brilliant and really helpful. We left our bag in the taxi as we were checking in and the reception couldn’t do enough for us to try and trace the taxi, all be it to no avail. We were also given complementary breakfast in tick tock diner for the duration of our stay which is brilliant. The blue berry pancakes are a must. The room was clean and tidy although it was a little small and the bathroom could do with a little modernising but nothing that was a problem. All in all a great hotel for a great trip.;4
Great location, close to subway and Time Square. They had great customer service! Our room was modern and clean, but tiny. I mean, like we walk in the door and we had to squeeze in beside the bed so we could close the door and get to the rest of the room. Our bathroom door stuck a little, which caused a little panic about how I would be able to get out.   The concierge was helpful with how to get around town, and with getting us same day tickets to see Cats at a reasonable rate.  The in house restaurant was efficient and tasty.;4
Arrived around 10AM, however had to circle the block due to being unsure of where exactly valet parking was. Valet was very helpful. Completed pre-registration where I was told that I would receive a call when our room was ready. We were able to use the luggage check free of charge to store our bags until our room was ready, although I had to wait in line a half-hour to do so. They do charge to store bags if you are checking out, but did not charge us because we were checking in.   We did some site-seeing and arrived back around 3PM to see people were being checked in. After waiting in line for about 15 minutes, the Wyndham Rewards desk called me over, and after checking my pre-registration confirmation, told me that our room wasn't ready yet. Seeing as so many other people were;3
This was my second visit in the New Yorker hotel I've once again had a great experience. The hotel itself looks amazing, has wonderful views and couldn't be more accommodating. On this holiday I chose the New Yorker due to the special reason we we're visiting (birthday and engagement). The hotel, went out of their way to ensure our trip was amazing. A special shout out to the check-in and customer relationship team who went more than the extra mile to help me with my surprise.;5
"This hotel is old and dated. Be sure to request a renovated floor. The staff is very nice, but the concierge was not very helpful; she only recommended the restaurants on the property.    This was our second stay. The rooms are tiny, but this is NYC, I’ve accepted that.   The bathroom in our two-room suite was also just Ok.  Clear signs of water damage, and the tile was not as clean as I would expect.  The average night was $500 so very pricey.   We picked the hotel for location , but may look elsewhere next time.";3
After reading other reviews I always like to make my own mind up and then share my thoughts. I have to say I was more than impressed with this hotel, The New Yorker delivers everything you need for a stay in New York, comfort, amenities, location and a little but of history thrown in! The double metro rooms may be compact but they are beautifully decorated and maintained to a high standard, we had more than enough room for the very little time we stayed in there! Get out and enjoy the city People! The staff were friendly in their welcome and throughout our stay. This hotel is literally a street crossing from Madison Square Garden, Macy's and the Empire State building which we had an amazing view of from our room, and a short walk from Times Square, Central Park is only 30 mins;5
Nice room for the price. Check in well staffed with friendly people. Room was modern, clean.  Located very close to Penn Station. Lobby has an art deco feel to it. Outside noise was less than I expected.  Would stay here again.;4
Excellent, amazing stay, brilliant establishment, no complaints!  Staff were incredibly helpful, it was clean and tidy. In an ideal location. Suited my needs perfectly, I received everything I asked for and was promised;5
I love this hotel for its Art Deco-style architecture, its location and the bed sheets! It is about a block or so from Penn (subway) station, few more blocks from Javits center and the Megabus stop. We reserved a room with two double beds and it was spacious enough. We enjoyed the view of the Empire State building from our bed (34th floor). The room itself and the bathroom were very clean with fresh towels and sheets with a crisp/cool feel. The room had a safe and a good quality hair dryer. It didn't offer a mini coffee/tea maker though. It has a lovely Art Deco lobby with good security (you have to show your room key in order to take the elevators). The concierge service was very helpful and friendly. The surrounding area was very pleasant as well with the well-known 34th St.;4
Hotel with a excellent location and one amazing view to Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden.  Large rooms with a lot of space for family and rest after a long day.  Very quick check out. No stress;5
We had a great experience here! I️ booked a 2 double room through Groupon at an incredible rate. The room was dated and we didn’t have a view but I knew that going in and the location was great! We had plenty of room for the 4 of us with 2 bathrooms and 2 closets. The beds were small but comfortable. This was the most affordable way to stay near midtown/Times Square.;4
"I came for a conference at the Javits center and the hotel was located just 4 blocks away which was great. The ""standard room"" was clean but was very small and had old, outdated interior and fixtures, and was in a creepy back hallway,, not  all what I expected based on the website pictures. The mattress was quite uncomfortable. The security here was good. There is no coffee maker in the room. I called three times to have one sent to my room and it never made it. I finally went to the front desk and the check in staff had one sent up. If location is important, it will work. Overall, not worth the amount I paid for the hotel.";2
we shared a queen suite btw 3 of us (my partner, myself and my mother). it gave us two bathrooms and that extra room provided us with more space just to relax in. so we didn't have a view except of the next building but i didn't come to NY to sit and look out of my window. we were on the 20th floor which meant all the lifts stop there... that is good news as the size of the hotel sometimes means a little wait for a lift. beds are very comfy, rooms and bathrooms were clean. location is perfect.. 2 blocks form the empire state, 10 mins to times square, across the road from the subway at 34th/penn street.  mid range price hotel. we arrived at 2 much to early to check in but the reception staff were very courteous about this and free  checked us in, so that we could store our;4
I stayed here with my friend as running the New York Marathon. I found the hotel was in an excellent position for all tourist attractions that we wanted to visit as well as being next to the subway station. Our room on the 37th floor had an excellent view of the Empire State Building which made up for the ‘tired’ bathroom. Though not dirty it felt grubby with black around the bath sealant and floor stains. The room was larger than expected and the beds and pillows were so comfortable which was very welcome after our 26 mile run! We asked for and was given a coffee machine very promptly which I feel was the level of service experienced by all the staff we came across - friendly and efficient. The level of amenities in the room was what I would expect in a 3* hotel;4
I booked The New Yorker Hotel in New York City at the last minute when I decided I wanted to celebrate my birthday in the Big Apple. I was a little hesitant knowing that the New Yorker is such a big hotel and being so close to Penn Station, I didn't know what condition it would be in but I took the chance and am absolutely thrilled that I did. We checked in rather late which made me wonder what rooms were left for us but...whether it was because I told the gentleman that it was my birthday or it was simply the room that was assigned to us, we had a great room on the 37th floor with a view of the Empire State Building right outside our window! It was absolutely amazing. But not only that, the room was very clean and the sheets and towels were of the best quality. I was very;5
Great location,guiet,clean.. Staff professional , courteous accommodating.  Housekeeping staff friendly, helpful, through, efficient. We were upgraded without asking at checking. Love the diner, proximity,good food. Would select the New Yorker again.;5
I took my granddaughter, along with my sister and her husband on a short first time trip to New York City.  Since we were doing the Amtrak experience(never again), I wanted a hotel close to Pen Station.  The New Yorker was that hotel.  A great experience for us.  The service was wonderful.  The hotel is very well kept.  Our room was laid out well for us.  Two closets was just what we needed, since we had three women.  The bathroom was the only exception for me.  It was very small.  Large shower was great, but the rest was very small.  The rest of the room made up for the bathroom though.  Everything was clean and inviting.  Even though we didn't have our room serviced, the housekeepers were there with towels, etc., daily.   There is a restaurant adjacent to the hotel that was;5
My experience at the Wyndham New Yorker was fraught with disappointment. I understand that rooms are small and that is accurate. But Construction outside my room (on the 26th floor, I mean outside my window) for 8 hours was a bit much. Then my electrical outlets went out on one of the two walls and another inconvenience. Then the shower would go from scalding to cold within minutes and without touching the valves. I tried to change rooms, but they only offered two double beds in an updated room. My wife and I enjoy sleeping in the same bed, so that was not an option. This may not be everyone's experience, just mine and absolutely factual.;2
I've stayed a number of time at this hotel. The first night on this trip, there was a noise issue. I went to the front desk and asked them to  move me. They were very helpful and move us.  The security is on top of it checking for room keys, and the restaurants are very good. I will continue to stay at the New Yorker.;5
Stayed here in conjunction with sports tours international for the 2017 New York City Marathon, rooms are clean and roomy enough, housekeeping are efficient and do a great job, wonderful art decor feeling, would be ruined if refurbished stones throw from lots off main New York attractions great views;5
Nice stay, nice bedrooms, restaurants nearby, Starbucks and McDonalds in front of the hotel, nice cafeteria, nice bistro, etc., etc.   Hot shower, friendly hosts, nice attention, very good people. You and your family will guarantied enjoy.;5
My twin sister and I stayed in The New Yorker last weekend and loved every minute . We were celebrating our 30th Birthday and when we checked in, the hotel manager gave us a nice upgrade to the 30th floor, and had a bottle on wine sent up to the room. She was really friendly and couldn't do enough for us.  Our room was small, but it was perfect for what we needed. Lovely view of the Hudson. The bathroom was nice and modern, had a walk in shower ( no bath). We had a coffee machine, water in our room on arrival. The bed was super comfortable and didn't hear any noise from outside. The room got cold, but the heating was great and warmed up very quickly .  We ate in both restaurants ( tick tock diner and Trattoria Bianca). Tick tock was lovely, we had lunch here, service was a;4
Spent three days at the New Yorker.   I thought the location was good.  Your only blocks away from the Empire State bldg.  Yea, the decor may not be to everyones taste, but Oh well.  Big Plus is Central Air with a Thermostat , no window air conditioner...  .  If you choose the basic room package, yes, your room will be smaller than you would expect, but you get all that you need in a Hotel room. Comfy bed with nice soft pillows.    As others have mentioned I also did like the fact that you had to show your room key to the attendant to get to the elevators, and yes he was checking everyone.   I would stay here again.;4
We stayed for 2 nights in this great hotel. We had a nice room on the 31st floor. We had amazing views of the Empire State Building, Chrysler’s building,  Madison square garden and New York skyline. The staff were really friendly and helpful. The diner is great for breakfast to start your day. Don’t get me wrong it’s not perfect and a few areas are a little tired but this just adds to the charm. I would recommend anyone to stay that want clean, friendly and a hotel in a great location. I will definitely return. Thanks New Yorker hotel.;4
The hotel is dated with carpeting worn, wall paper torn in places, mold in the bathrooms. It's getting closer to being a dump. The staff are friendly and helpful.  Barely a Wyndham worthy property.;3
Great location next to Penn station and Madison square Garden. Stayed in a room with two double beds so a bit more spacious. Staff very pleasant apart from our first encounter with the lady on the reception desk who was not the most welcoming after a very long day traveling, my credit card payment would not process so I had to give her 1000 dollars in cash - she was not at all helpful, I dont know what would have happened if I did'nt have cash - was she going to throw us out! - she certainly did'nt offer any alternatives and her attitude tainted my whole experience of my stay in the hotel. Also the hidden charges are a major turn off - 29 dollars per day extra charge which was not specified on booking. However overall I enjoyed our stay in the hotel but I think I could have got;3
People seem to either love this place or hate it. I checked in around 1 p.m. and there was indeed a room ready - I'd been apprehensive, but Gabriela at the front desk took good care of that. It is a lovely lobby, and the exterior details, and some of the interior is high Art Deco, if you're an architecture buff. It reminds me of the hotels my parents stayed when I was a kid and they were at conventions, large hallways, somewhat elderly bathrooms, a few scrapes here and there that were painted over. Real closets, not so common in new hotels in this price range, an iron and ironing board. Smallish bathroom but a big showerhead and quick-to-warm-up hot water. No vanity - the hair dryer is in a bag on the back of the bathroom door. In this day and age of trademark mattresses, this;3
First stay booked a twin room but this had not been done had no option but accept it as no rooms available told about the extra charge which had been placed deviously unbeknown to us in the booking paperwork. A ploy now being used more and more by American hotels and you cannot have it removed. Second stay twin room. The foyer is wonderful and that is where it all ends. Upper floor corridors showing their age dingey. The rooms aren't the best and bathrooms are in dire need of refurbishment. The hotel was booked by our travel company we relied on them to provide an acceptable hotel. Their turnover of guests is high and it is always busy. In this environment management are not particularly bothered as they have plenty of bucks coming in. Basically a lot of one nighters. Basically;1
We had such an amazing time at this hotel. Just like most NYC hotels, this place is old, but has been beautifully renovated without losing any of its charms!  When we checked in, the lady at the front desk was so cute with my 10 and 12 year old boys and she upgraded our room. I wish I had properly thanked her! Our room was amazing and huge! The location is perfect and convenient. I can't wait to come back again!!;5
Stayed here as part of a sports package for the New York marathon. Stayed in a room with a fellow runner who I had not met before. As such the room wasn’t designed the best, with not much space and no lock on the bathroom door etc. Not the greatest idea for 2 strangers as such. Luckily we got on well. The hotel is nice and it is grand, but it’s a little outdated in terms of decor. The tick tock restaurant which is attached was where I had breakfast on Marathon morning, as this was allocated by the sports company. Very bad service in here. Rude waiters and we had to request to be served at least 3 times before it happened. Good location of the hotel though. Very central and can walk to most things or get the doorman to get you a cab. Amazing views though from my window;3
A nice hotel, great location within walking distance of everything you need to see in New York and amazing diner adjoined on the ground floor. Under going a refurb at the moment but not a huge impact. Basic room is quite small but as long as you’re here to sleep and not ball room dance it’s fine :);4
This hotel has a great location and is right opposite Madison sq garden and penn station ...10 minute walk from Times square and lots of shopping close by . The staff at the New yorker are hit and miss - Rachel on reception desk [on the right] is a delight and its very security concious ....we have stayed here 3 times as we come each year but after our recent stay last month we wont be staying here again . After booking i emailed to request a room with 2 beds [no reply to the email] when we arrived after 12 hour journey we were given a room with 1 bed which was designed for 1 disabled person and had no bedside table , no view and was grubby with black peeling grout around the bath and dirty bathroom floor and a musty smell . When I immediately asked to be moved I was told there;1
"Ended up paying for two rooms instead of one due to staff confusion and their customer service keeps responding with the same cut-paste response every time.  Also, watch out for ""Double Queen Bed"" room description, that actually means ""Single Queen Bed"". Rooms are renovated but the hallways are old and smelly. Felt bad bringing my mom here. :(";1
Hotel close to Penn Station, and the Highline not to far away, room had a good view of the Empire State building, staff attentative, room cleaned each day to a high stadard, beds comfy. Overall the hotel did what we needed it to do.;4
This hotel is in an amazing location for mid town manhattan just turn the corner and you can see the Empire State Building it takes about 10 minute walk and your stood outside the building. 10 minute walk the opposite way and your outside Times Square. Our room slept 4 people but was only 3 of us and was a squeeze. Before you go to New York book then book C3 passes online it saves loads of money and you get to choose 3 amazing sites to see and explore. Broadway is a short walk offering the BEST shows we saw Aladdin and was fantastic. Lastly for food there is plenty of places to eat nearby with a macdonalds across the road too!;4
I stayed here for a night, room quality is so bad I slept 2-3 hours and went to work at 4:30 am and slep there;1
I needed a room close to Penn for an early morning train and wasn’t expecting much.  My expectations were far exceeded.  I was in a beautiful room, recently renovated, with two beds, a sitting alcove and a beautiful, albeit small, bathroom.  The room had lovely Art Deco touches, including light fixtures and modern furniture that nonetheless harkened back to the Deco’s heyday. The hallway is a tad bit shopworn (particularly the carpets) but overall, a very positive experience.;4
We stayed for a weekend me and my two girlfriends for a fun girls trip. Booking with three of us we were given a room with one queen size bed and told there was nothing they could do to accommodate us. The older lady at the front desk wanted nothing to do with us and was very, very mean to us. Our room was not cleaned the entire time and room service does NOT answer. Also when we first arrived our rooms were not ready so feeling like we needed to refresh and change after our flight we got ready in the bathroom downstairs of the hotel. Another rude worker came in and said “girls you’re scaring away the guests from using the bathrooms” first of all what does that even mean?! How RUDE!! We are the guests!! Ugh. Not to mention the hotel hallways and room looks like something out of;2
The hotel is very old and quite interesting. There are renovated rooms, but we stayed in an older room. The beds were super comfy. The view was of the Empire State Building.  The bathroom was tiny as was the closet, but at least there was an ironing board and iron. One floor length mirror was helpful for getting ready to go out.  The diner downstairs was open 24/7, but the food was mediocre.  The bar and restaurant off of the lobby wasn't ever too busy with super cheap drinks in our opinion.  There was work being done right next door to our room so it was quite noisy for several hours, but not too bothersome. If you must wait for your friends in the hotel lobby, it was always super busy without a spot to sit at all so we waiting outside as the weather was nice.;2
A most well-located landmark, but the rooms are so small, no coffee machine, customer services is rather vigilant and unfriendly, and the price is too high for a 10 by ten cubicle.;3
As I travel all over the world for work, what I've found is so often the staff ether make or break a hotel.  My experience here this week is that the staff couldn't have been more helpful. We are an event company and brought a number of athletes to the property and the staff was great.  Secuirty is always a big issue for us this hotel has a very good security presence and I for one always feel a lot safer when that's the case.  I also had a small issue with room (not the hotels fault at all) and the manager contacted me and went well beyond what I expected to resolve.  Myself, our staff and our athletes all enjoyed the Wyndham.;5
We had a corner double suite on 24th floor with amazing views of the Empire State Building on one side and Madison Square Gardens on the other (see photo). The suite was a great size for our family with 2 older teens. Lounge area with sofa, (our 17 year old son used this as his bed and found it remarkably comfortable)large dining table, mini fridge,coffee machine,TV and desk. Separate bedroom with 2 double beds and walk-in storage. Small bathroom but who needs anything large and everything worked well including a hot powerful shower. No problems with traffic noise as pretty muffled being so high up. Staff were all very friendly and helpful, including organising our airport transfer before we arrived. And the location is amazing for a city visit with pretty much most things;5
Loved this hotel ... very small room but ok for what we needed it for :)  We had a view of Maddison square garden from our room I loved the decor it was lovely .. Tick tock dinner I found was over rated ...   Best thing was we got engaged in this very hotel   We will definitely be back;5
The staff was excellent.  The room was good but is a bit over priced.  However, we would stay there again.  I booked through Wyndham but would probably shop around as it appears other websites give a better deal than Wyndham.  One would think they would reward their members but apparently not.;5
"Cons - 30th floor room that was so small one of us had to sit on the bed while the other got ready. Tiny 4ft 6"" bed that we could bearly roll over without knocking each other out of bed. Should be a single person room only, can't believe they can market it as a double. Customer service average to blasé, but they still expected major tips. Pros - decent location for all midtown sights, modern refurbished rooms, average price";3
Stayed here for one night on a quick trip to Manhattan for business. My assistant found it and booked it and certainly that choice won’t win any brownie points from me.   I’ll keep this short and say that the hotel is huge. 42 floors I think. Art Deco style. Though the style is lost behind a veneer of shabbiness. The room was small and clean. Not well appointed or overly comfortable. My mint green bathroom looked like it was original to the 40’s. Not even a toilet paper holder. Simple a roll on the sink shelf.    The kicker for me was the walk to the room. The hallways are interior. No windows, bad lighting, kind of dirty, and all combining to a scary vibe. I felt like I was walking the hall of the hotel from The Shining.   It is however a busy hotel. Lots of budget tourists on;3
Room was small. Sink in small bathroom drained slow. Had to call security 5 times because of noise in room next door. Was charged 10.00 a day for a facility charge. Was not told of this. Ask what it was for a nobody knew. 300.00 a night was too much for this hotel.WILL not stay here again.;2
Excellent location, I could walk almost everywhere and the metro station is right outside the main door! Good fitness centre and rooms very clean (although a bit small) To be NYC it's a very good price-quality Keep in mind that the price of the hotel doesn't include the resort fees ad taxes!;4
As always, it's very convenient for me to take Amtrak into NYC and stay at the New Yorker. Friendly people at the front desk and housekeeping as well as perfect location for me.;5
The New Yorker is a beautiful historic building, but it's tired and underwhelming in its current condition.;3
A really great hotel to stay at whether it’s a short stay or a longer stay I’d recommend staying here. Great location with friendly staff. Rooms are comfy and a good size would certainly stay here again on future visits to the big Apple.;5
I stayed at the hotel for 10 days in October 2017, and I can definitely say that there was not one thing that wasn’t great about my stay, the staff was professional and friendly, wonderful location- located a five minute walk for Times Square and right next to Pennsylvania station and Madison square garden, the view was stunning as well as the decor of the hotel itself, the room was fairly spacious and big, which was surprising because usually hotel rooms in New York are no where near spacious, the staff was the best out of every hotel I have ever been to, and was always nice, polite and happy to help me with every little problem that I had. Of course the gym and the history exhibit downstairs were just a bonus, the gym was big and clean with various kinds of equipment, and the;5
We stayed at The New Yorker this past weekend. The property was a relatively easy walk from Grand Central, and a straight shot from the theaters. You’ll need to show your room key when heading to the elevators. This is great from a security standpoint despite not getting a heads up from the front desk. The night we checked in while we were out at dinner I received a welcome email from the property that offered some upgrade options. I thought this was a great idea, so I selected the champagne and truffles package but received another email 20 minutes later that they could not process the request. Disappointed, now thinking we’d have something waiting for us when we got back I placed another order for just the champagne. I monitored the email and never had a subsequent;3
I loved the decor of this old building. We were given an upgrade. The room had been refurnished, so the place is historic and up to date at the same time. Very convenient for catching our train at Penn Station. We just rolled our suitcases across the street.;5
Waw what an excellent hospitality and excellent hotel. We love New York and this hotel made us feel more in love with the people there. We slept in the most confortable bed of our experience. The service and the staff are 5 star. Thank you.;5
Enjoyed the convenience of walking distance to Madison Sq Garden and Macy's.  Also nice to have 24hr restaurant in lobby. Only negative was unavailability to check in early. We understand it may not happen but why bother sending wyndham rewards members an email encouraging a 2pm early check in when clearly the likelihood is low.  We also thought the employee representing the rewards desk seemed uninterested and was literally on the phone while asking what we needed...not friendly.  Tried calling the hotel, but still no success. Saw others in lobby waiting with us gets calls for early check in before us.  At the end of day we had a room at 4pm, but maybe it should be made clear due to popularity that early Check in is not likely at this location. Also, this early check in piece;4
This is my second time that I have stayed in the New Yorker. It’s pretty basic, it’s clean, the rooms are small, the pricing is reasonable and the location is great. Not much else that I have to say other than the fact that I would use this hotel again if I visit again.;4
"This hotel needs an update and needs to add some amenities.  Our room was small, with nowhere to even charge a cell phone except on the floor or hanging over the toilet; they could at least invest in a charging cube placed in a convenient spot.  The bathroom  -- old fixtures, no room to store anything.  No coffee or tea maker in the room; and no coffee or tea available in the lobby -- except in the morning when the Tick Tock Diner located in the building staffs a counter in the hotel lobby -- and it's not complimentary.  Housekeeping was very good, but the lobby staff were less than helpful.  The lobby is attractive, the meeting room that our group used was okay but minimal, the hallways were shabby and depressing.  My overall rating would be -- if it were an available rating --";2
This hotel is in a great location - 5 mins walk to the Empire State Building, 10 mins to High line, 15 mins to Times Square, 30 to Central Park.  The rooms were very 1930s but clean and we had a fantastic view, the staff can't do enough.  If you want a trendy boutique hotel this isn't for you - the hotel is a bit faded and the lifts on our floor reminded me of the Disney Tower of Terror ride! But we will go again, we loved the views and location and quite like the history!;4
We stayed here for 8 days and it was very expensive. The room was so small there was hardly any room to walk around the bed to get to the bathroom. No tea or coffee facility to make a nice hot drink. Was so annoying having to go from the 42nd floor I believe we was on to go down and out to get a coffee. Security was really good. There was a very hot guy on reception and I kept flirting with him and he flirted back. Nice hotel, just not worth the money they ask for. Oh yeah, hard to receive a WiFi signal so high up too.;4
I stayed here from 1st - 6th September 2017 - and it was awesome! We were there for Labour day.   At the hotel we had a metro queen room, I think it was room 3114. The room was big enough for the 2 of us. The bed was quite big and super comfy. The air con worked perfectly and was pretty quiet. The bathroom was quite small, in that if you sat on the toilet you wouldn't be able to close the door! Also, the room had a wardrobe which had a safe, and was big enough for both cases + more! We had a view of Madison Square Garden, which was cool too - at night it was very quiet considering it was peak season.   The hotel has a diner 'attached' to it (Tick Tock Diner). We ate here the first evening (has a massive burger for cheap), and every morning we came here for breakfast - getting a;4
I've probably stayed in 20 hotels in NYC.  This was a last minute find on Hotels Tonight.   I'll avoid it next time.   For first-time NYC visitors, it might be fine.   Our room was the smallest I've ever had in the city.  Service was so-so.   Lobby was always packed with bus loads.;2
Back for another visit to the fantastic New Yorker.Our room was clean,beds comfortable and room service was very good.All of the staff were friendly and helpful and the visible security prescence was reassuring.We used the Tick Tock diner for breakfast,staff being pleasant each morning.I have stayed in other New York hotels but this is my favourite.A beautiful building with history.;5
"One would think that a hotel with such a name would positively represent the city, perhaps it does, the part that is over priced.  I don't mind a small room but mine is claustrophobic and I was alone. The bed had a distinct middle and it is as bare as any budget hotel. It can take 5 mins to get on and off the evelator. The tick tock diner has slow and rude service and provides unappetizing yet expensive breakfasts.  The bar is nice enough and certainly necessary after anytime spent in the facility. And speaking of such, it is under constant repair, and they even charge a ""facility fee of $29 a night, I guess that is for the nice towels? Good location but there are plenty of better choices in the area.";2
Location is great and price is very convenient, but this is more like a 2 stars or maybe 3 stars at most. It is old, dirty and under renovation. Personnel is rude. At 6:30 pm they had not made my room.;1
We stayed here for 6 nights as part of a Road Scholar program. Location was convenient and our room was comfortable and quiet. Elevator service was good. We added one night before the program and it was hard to coordinate the two reservations. Staff was very helpful but we still got locked out after the first night. Also, we asked for 45 minute late departure and were given it but room automatically locks    you out at noon. Had to have someone let us back in. All in all, a good experience and we would return.;4
First time in New York. The room was small but I have view of Empire State Building and Madison square garden. My friend lives in NYC so he was my tour guide we took the subway to time Square only one stop away.;5
"We spent six days at Wyndham New Yorker. That was a very pleasant stay.  Apparently, we were told when we cheked out, we got af free upgrade. The room was very good. Very clean and nice. Good shower. Space enough for two. Very comfortable bed. It was on the eigth floor. There was some noice from the street - earplugs solved that.  The hotel charge a ""service fee"", 29 dollars per day. That cover for ex. fittnes-center. You have to pay even if you do not use any of the ""services"" the fee cover. That is not satisfying. The  hotel aught to charge guests that use the services. But we were informed about the fee when we booked, so it did not come as a surprise.  The hotel is places very central on Manhattan. It is easy get aorund from there. If you want to stay in a relative (NYC is";3
We were very pleased with our experience withThe New Yorker Wyndham Hotel. We were close to Time Square, Broadway. The Hotel was helpful to get us where we wanted to go and to answer our questions.The room was comfortable and very clean.;5
"The New Yorker is a great place to stay. Position is good. Rooms are a bit small. One thing that always annoys me is that once you have booked and payed the advertised price that I think that this might be the only hotel in the world that then charges what they call a ""Facility Fee"". It is a bit difficult to figure out what this is meant to pay for, but I gather it has something to do with the very small Gym in the basement.   Others have said that if you look carefully enough that you can figure out that there is this post-booking fee. This is not good enough and even in very basic first year contract law is not legal or enforceable.";3
This hotel is in great location. Right in the middle of Manhattan. Walking distance from Empire State Building, to Madison square garden and 10 min walks from Times Square. If you want to book trips anywhere in the city use the information desk at the hotel and John at this desk, is gonna do everything to help you. We stayed at tre 8h floor which was recently renovated. The room was spacious, the washroom small but everything was clean. We parked the car 60$ a night and you don't get your car until you leave. But you don't need it because everything it's close by, even the subway station.  We ate at the Trattoria Bianca at the Wyndham Hotel and the food was delicious and the service was fast. When our waitress heard that it was my Bday, they brought us a peace of Tiramisu with a;4
We were able to walk to so much from this hotel, including Empire State Building, Times Square, Grand Central Station, Eataly, Madison Square Gardens and Church on Sunday, held in a theater right around the corner!  The staff were so very nice and helpful.  The only thing I thought was a bit sad is that you had to go downstairs to see the faded pictures of its former glory days in the 1920s-30s. If they could find some way to display that history up top in the lobby, in a beautiful, classic way, it would be very cool. Now because it is from the classic era, the rooms were quite small, so just be prepared.  You are not coming to this hotel to hang out in your room, of course!  My husband and I could not be in the same area of the room, other than the bed, at the same time.  I had;5
A grand hotel from the 1930s with friendly helpful staff.   We stayed in a basic room with queen size bed which was clean and tidy, if a bit tired in decor.    Disappointed that having paid hotel as part of package, including taxes, we were then charged 10$ per day for access to wi fi and the gym, both of which are advertised as amenities on their website.   (This might now be standard practice for hotels in USA, but not something we have encountered before).   We used the hotel bistro and trattoria which were good.   We used the airport shuttle service from JFK which took about an hour and half in heavy traffic.   Later learned that we could have used the monorail to Jamaica, then train to Madison Square Garden which only takes about half an hour.;4
Nice hotel close to most of what we wanted to see. The suite was nice and cozy with amazing views. Only issue, I was emailed (unsolicited ) that I had an upgrades suite with early check in. But when I arrived, the suite was not ready so we waited 45 minutes in the lobby.  The suite was worth the wait for the view.;4
Situated conveniently near to Times Square and around the corner to Penn Station, this hotel is in an excellent location to explore the city. The building is a striking Art Deco design and has a charm about it. We have stayed here twice, and on both occasions, arriving by car is was bit of a nightmare as there are so many cabs and vehicles blocking the parking drop off area, this does need to be handled a little better. We opted for valet parking as it was the easiest solution. Check in was efficient but long queues can form at busy times. You will be required to show your room key to get to the elevators but we liked this as it was somewhat reassuring that non guest can’t get to the rooms. I would suggest that you book the best room you can afford as the basic rooms are small;5
The hotel is on 8th Avenue, three long blocks from the Javits Center.  I chose valet parking as the price was about the same as do-it-yourself parking around the block. While I was there, Madison Square Gardens is a block away. I took in the Billy Joel concert while I was there. Good hotel for the price conscious.  There are old rooms and newly updated rooms. I had a updated room ... nothing to complain about.  Friend had an old room & was less than thrilled.  Get an updated room.;3
Quite well situated near Madison Square Garden However the hotel is rather dated being quite Art Deco but can also be seen as a positive feature as some hotels are quite clinical looking today with little character  For what you pay a night the rooms are very average with no tea/drink facilities meaning you have to venture out whenever you want a drink etc or visit the adjacent diner/cafe There is a separate Italian or Mediterranean restaurant & bar accessed from inside the lobby which is operated independently and we found this very nice. There is also a diner on the opposite side of the hotel which is adequate for most people I guess  Staff-wise most are friendly and helpful but it has a high turnover of guests with no personal service as such. Would I stay there again;3
Stayed here with family for a 4 night stay  It has all you really need for staying in New York. It’s not somewhere your going to spend a lot of time in a hotel room. Room was a little small for 3 of us, couldn’t wheel the case between the beds, room was clean though & just what we needed.  Ice machine on our floor which was brill The tick tock dinner is brilliant being attached to the hotel - we went every morning.  In a great location.  Not a luxury stay if that’s what your looking for but we weren’t so was good for us.;4
We stayed here for a convention, and for a few days as tourists in the city.  Overall the experience was great.  The real difference maker for me this trip was the friendliness of the staff.  They make you feel welcome and happy to be there.   The rooms are nice, large for NYC, clean and have everything you need.  The location is excellent, central to everything, right by the subway station, and within walking distance to times square, central park, and tons of restaurants.  They have a diner and a nice restaurant / bar on property which is great for starting / ending your day after being out and about.  I would definitely stay here again, and recommend it for anyone visiting NYC who wants to have a safe, comfortable, convenient and friendly home base in the city.;5
This was our first time in New York City and we where traveling by train.  Because we came into Penn Station, I wanted a hotel within walking distance to the train station and also within walking distance to the Javis Center where we would be attending an event.  The New Yorker A Wyndham Hotel was the perfect location.  We were greeted by  Laura, the front desk person who was pleasant and very professional.  Even though we were early, she found us a room so we could settle in and begin our touring.  Although the room was small, it was clean and well appointed.  The bed was so comfortable.  It was so welcome after a long day of walking through town. Everyone was very helpful and welcoming.  If we go to New York again, which I'm sure we will I will definitely be staying there.;5
First time to New York and was there for business conference. New Yorker accommodations were quaint and full of nostalgia. Great location for walking to some of the tourist sights and feeling the buzz of the city, but not luxury stay by any means. Staff were helpful and friendly.;3
We had an excellent stay. We dealt with Mohammed and he did an fantastic job for us! He went out of his way to help us. The room was all we had hoped for. Made our 1 night stay in New York very enjoyable.;5
The two main things you should know is this is in an incredible location. It's right by Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Javits Center, and Macy's Herald Square. That's a huge draw for travelers. It's also a gorgeous hotel, especially in the art deco lobby. That said, there are huge problems with this hotel. Housekeeping was very subpar and they once left someone's food in my room. There were chunks of tile and ceramic missing from the shower/tub. I paid for a room with a view and got a room with a fantastic view...of the room across from it. I have stayed at plenty of hotels and am used to hearing noise in the rooms next to me, but this had the thinnest walls I've ever heard. I had a good experience here as a kid, but I will never stay here again. The front of house staff;2
This is my first ever review. It was booked based on a recommendation and we were really disappointed with the service. Check in was at 4, we checked our bags at lunchtime and arrived back at 5 to it still not ready. It was suggested we wait in another family member's room and it would be ready at 6 and given a breakfast coupon. 6.20 and still no word so I called reception to be told they had to check with housekeeping and call me straight back. We had travelled from Ireland and waiting in my mothers room who at this stage was really tired and we wanted to get out of the way. I called again in 20 minutes to be told same thing. I got annnoyed at this stage and was assured it was the Manager I was speaking to and she would get back to me. At 7pm we left the room to go down to;1
On check in we were given an upgrade to a room with a view, which was brilliant. The hotel is in a fantastic location, right opposite Penn Station & Madison Square Gardens, three blocks from the Empire State Building and eight blocks from Times Square.  The hotel is older having been built in the 1930’s so t has some character to it. Bathroom is dated but was clean and the shower had fantastic pressure, Room was a good size and kept very clean.   Had a great stay.;4
The location is close to Penn Station so it is possible to get there from other main line stations and the airport without any problem.  There is also a tube line that runs the length of Manhattan. Although the location is good, the hotel is in need of decoration and repair, the whole place looks tired.  The bedrooms are small and dated and all furnishing has seen better days. Checking in can take a while, there is always a huge line. On the brighter side the bed was comfortable and there was plenty of hot water and towels. The  gym was good and not crowded.;2
Just back from 4 nights in the Wyndham New Yorker and we could only praise every single aspect! We told Driss on check-in that it was my first visit to New York, and he worked hard to find us a room with a view - of the Empire State Building on the 31st floor. Our 2-bed room was extremely clean and comfortable. Not huge, but still plenty of space for two. The bathroom was small but adequate, and although the hot/cold mixer shower was erratic you have to remember the age of this hotel. I viewed the tired look of the bathroom as part of its heritage - if you want modern chain hotel looks and facilities, book a modern chain hotel. Our free Wi-Fi was perfect throughout. We mistakenly left the Do Not Disturb sign on our door one day and inside 10 minutes of our return that evening;5
Big old building. It should have lots of charm--not here.  Postage sized pillows.  Postage sized room.  No glasses in bath.  No shelf in bath to put your stuff on while getting ready.  Substandard bar--looks like a Denny's diner.  But this hotel costs $1,100 for two nights!   Lame.;2
Just back from New York. 2nd time to stay in the New Yorker. Love it for location. It's quaint. Thank you Mohammad at the front desk, we arrived early but u took great care of us. Got us booked into a room and rang to check if we were happy with it. Will be back again.;5
Stayed here twice this month (Oct 2017) with my wife.  The first time, we arrived at the hotel at 19:00 and left the next day at 09:00. As a result, we opted for a room on the 8th floor, with no view expected. That's what we got! Out of the window, there was a ten foot gap to the adjacent building's boring brickwork. Still, it didn't bother us at all due to our circumstances - others might be less accepting.  On our return, we booked a better (i.e. higher price) room, on a higher floor (the 30th). Although significantly higher in price, the room and its facilities were almost an exact replica of the room we'd had on the first visit. The exception was the view, which basically meant only about two-thirds of the vista was of adjacent brickwork: the rest was of many rooftops across;4
I booked this hotel after receiving nothing but good reviews. I emailed the hotel prior to my arrival and I received a reply guaranteeing a room on a high floor with a view of the Empire State as I was there for a celebration. When I arrived we were given a basic room on the 21st floor on the opposite side of the building with no view. The room was in need of refurbishment but clean. As we were there to visit the sites the room was just fine for a little time we would be spending in it. On check in, I was also offered a bottle of wine/champagne as they noted I was there for a celebration. I was advised that this would be delivered to my room however we didn’t receive the bottle of wine at all during the 7 days we were there. I am disappointed that we were promised 2 things and;3
We arrived in a panic after an incident at another hotel and everything was handled very well. My only complaint about the service would be that the front desk staff stopped being nice to us as we were checking out, they loose patience and try to get rid of you. Our room was TINY, so small that we barely fit our bags and had to maneuver around them just to get to the bed and the bathroom. Room was clean and pretty, lobby very nice and the location amazing if you want to stay in the middle of everything.;4
Very late with this review  Family of 4  Children 14 & 8  Over all fantastic trip kids first time in NYC  saw all the sights walked and walked.  Hotel is in a fantastic location pen station across the road shops and bars restaurants on the doorstep.. couldn't recommend location enough Hotel itself is fine bit dated but clean we had a room on the 27th floor good view and elevators were always quick no problems there rooms are clean but used bed are comfortable and size was good(husband 6ft1) 2 queen bed kids shared one.. bathrooms not so good shower was either freezing or scalding to the point my 8yr old couldn't shower... came back one night and toilet had leaked maintenance came straight up we were offered to change rooms while they sorted it but said it would only take 30 mins;4
We arrived on a Friday evening at 2200hrs after a long train journey from Toronto. We were tired & hungry. The receptionist was not at all helpful & just 'went through the motions' - demanding our passport & credit card details, issuing our room key & pointing to a space saying 'Elevator that way!' The corridors & lifts were shabby & not very clean & our room was little more than a shoe box in size with a shower over the bath which was difficult to control! As we left, 2 days later, we were asked if we had enjoyed our stay. When we explained our problems we were told we should have asked for a different room. Why? We were tired & hungry & couldn't they have provided a better room anyway? Or do they magically provide better rooms on demand!;1
This hotel is in a perfect spot, near to time Square, and all the great landmarks.. The hotel is lovely inside and felt very safe,you have to show your room pass to get into a lift.. Very disappointed with the size of the room,not enough storage space,no chest of drawers to put underwear/t shirts, sink was tiny and useless if you use a flannel to wash..we were on 7th floor and didn't hear any traffic... Don't think I would stay here again,unless I had a bigger room with better storage..tick tock dinner was nice,but expensive..breakfast for 2was nearly £30!!!;3
My friend and I checked into the hotel for a 2 night stay for a nearby event. The hotel is in pristine condition and is in excellent location. We were able to walk everywhere that we needed, including MSG, the Javits Center, and numerous restaurants.  Additionally, we were immediately next to a 24 hour diner, a movie theater, and the Hammerstein. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Muhammad who provided us with EXCELLENT customer service. As individuals who work in the customer service industry, we were extremely impressed with his professionalism and the quality of his assistance. He provided us with a great customer experience and we will definitely return because of it. Our room was great - clean, nice view, spacious. Everything we could have asked for. Thank you!!;5
The foyer and exterior of the hotel look great, but our room was tiny, and very shabby - the bathroom, though definitely deco style, was clarly original, but this is no reason for it to look like it has never been given any attention, and it had a very stained and chipped bath, cracked tiles and just felt grotty. The bedroom was functional, but missing basics, such as a second bedside table, and a real lack of space to leave luggage, or to set up the ironing board. I know that New York hotel rooms are compact, but this was something else! Lifts were quick though, and the Tick Tock Diner offered large portions and great service.  However, the biggest issue was that, upon checking in we were informed there would be a daily service charge (which hadn't been flagged to us by the;3
Stayed here for a birthday trip away for my husband in NYC This is a no frills hotel so don’t expect 5* luxury however it was clean and comfortable.  We were on the 32nd floor and could hear the traffic noise but only slightly and certainly not enough to keep us awake.  This hotel is in a great location right next to Penn Station so perfect if you are coming from JFK and also very close to Times Square, Empire State etc etc Staff were friendly and we had no problems checking in or out.  Wi-fi perfectly fine and TV in room half decent  A little disappointed not to see water provided in the room, I’d have thought this standard for most 3* hotels. Good to see security by the lifts, you have to show your room key to get in.  Beware of the Wyndham club - they will offer you free;4
This was our second visit to New York and we were very disappointed with this hotel, we arrived at the hotel to be advised that we would have to pay a resort fee of over 70 dollars for the three days, I asked what the money was for but was given no explanation, the receptionist just stated its compulsory. We were given a room on the 33rd floor it was tiny, it had no view and the décor certainly requires to be updated. The bathroom was stark and not very clean, rust on all the door hinges. Toilet roll holder on a wall about 6 feet from the toilet. I know we should have asked to be  moved but we didn't think we would be successful. The only thing in its favour is its central. Not my choice and I don't think that I would stay again, and I wouldn't recommend to my friends or family.;2
Great location.  Friendly staff.  Room an adequate size for what we needed (double room for us on our honeymoon).  Awesome view of Madison Square Garden from our room. Very clean hotel, towels changed and room service daily.  WiFi good.  Tick Tock diner downstairs worth a visit too.  Would definitely recommend and if we every return to NYC we would most certainly stay here again.;5
In a great location corner of 34th and 8th, the hotel is a little dated but rooms were a fair size and clean. There are plenty of lifts so no waiting around despite the hotel being full. Staff at reception were polite and helpful. We were on a family trip so somewhat disappointed to be put on three separate floors -which involved taking two different lifts to get to each others room. All rooms were on a different side of the building and we all experienced traffic noise through the night but you kind of expect that in New York. Would I recommend it -Yes it was good value compared to others we looked at. Would I stay again-Yes;4
Stayed at the New Yorker for 1 night before sailing to Bahamas,then stayed for 7 nights on our return .Great location .Everything more or less on your door step .Be picky about your room .Our room for the one night was the size of a postage stamp .At the point we informed staff we would not be returning for our 7 nights if this was our room allocation.Staff promised us we would have a better room when we returned in a weeks time .True to their word room was so much more spacious and we had a great view of the Hudson .We also requested coffee machine and one was put in place for our return .Staff were great .Location is just fab .My only issue really was they charge you to hold your luggage,which I have never had before at any hotel . We are returning in 2018 and would recommend;4
If you like character then this art deco hotel is for you. Some people seem to think it's tired. Wrong. It's a beautiful recreation of period art deco which quite rightly doesnt have the bling appeal of modern boutique hotels. We had a twin room which was very spacious, had two bathrooms and was well equipped. OK, we didnt have a terrific view but I dont really expect that in city centres. The tick tock diner is exactly what you expect in NY, with huge portions and attentive staff. If you like sport, book room 2549 which is the room Muhammed Ali stayed in after his classic 1971 fight against Joe Frazier (the hotel should make more of this). Central location, plenty of character and relaxed atmosphere. My only small criticism would be the limited choice of draught beers in the;4
Great hotel, and the perfect location! Right next to Madison Square Garden, and Times Square.   A lovely man called Muhammad checked us in, and looked after us so well. We were really impressed with the level of service.   Highly recommend if you are looking for a spot that feels close to everything!;4
Located in a great sport in midtown NY. The hotel is very close to major attractions and transport facilities.  It is walking distance to Emire state building and Times Square.  However, the rooms are very basic and no coffee and tea facilities (unless you ask room service, then they give you a coffee machine). Very busy hotel at all times of the day. The security staff were very alert even at 2.00 am in the morning.;3
Stayed here for 6 nights in October and chose this hotel due to its proximity to the Javits centre and the NYCC that we were visiting. But possibly wouldnt stay here again if returning to NY for a holiday. The pros:  Its Ideal for Madison square gardens and Hammerstein theatre which is next door. Javits centre only a 10 minute walk away Subway station practically outside and great shopping like Macy's 5 mins walk away, aswell as the Empire state building.  All night pharmacy opposite. The Tick Tock diner connected to the hotel is one of the best diners in NYC and open all hours.  Theres a steak and cocktail bar in the basement and  another italian bar/restaurant  which is very popular and reasonable. We stayed in a Deluxe Queen room, which is basically a double. The room was;3
We stayed at the iconic New Yorker Hotel this past weekend.  You couldn't ask for a better New York experience...ideal location for us to walk to dinner and a show or just around the mid-town/Times Square area. Staff was incredibly accommodating...looking forward to our next visit!;5
"When I last reviewed The New Yorker, I said I was happy enough but would probably look for something else next time.  Well, this is ""next time""...and the price for the location (or the location for the price) at this hotel were just too hard to go past.  We had a seven night stay and once more we really appreciated being within walking distance of so many landmarks - The Empire State Building, Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Herald Square, Fifth Avenue, Times Square and Broadway are all within striking distance.  Right outside are the subway entrances, to take you further afield.  Although the lobby is rather charming, much of the hotel is quite dated, though we found our room to be clean and comfortable - good beds, pillows etc.  When we arrived, it seems there was a";3
We stayed for 6 nights in August.  The hotel has a charm, it`s not very luxurious but does have some feel of old time glamour to it.  It`s a busy place, lobby often filled with busy people coming and going.    We didn`t encounter any problems during our stay, had wifi, plenty of hot water and beds were reasonable.  We were on a high floor, not facing the street and traffic noise was constant with sirens blaring through the night but since we were on vacation it didn`t bother us that much.  We would have liked to have had a view but didn`t ask to switch rooms.  Our room was indeed tiny. We were three with two beds and had a hard time storing our luggage without having to hop over it from bed to bathroom. Also when we checked in and started walking to our room a hotel employee;4
"Stayed here for 5 nights. First of all the good. Great location, historic Art Deco hotel which has in the main been restored with sympathy. Has a nice little museum that tells you some of the history of the hotel too. Our room was kept clean. Not so good, staff almost all, not that friendly (well certainly the ones we encountered) our room was on the small side which we had paid an extra circa $175 to have a ""view"" which at best was a ""part"" view due to where it was in the building. (Not worth it) Less good was my asking for a ""tour"" of the hotel to a front of house staff member who said someone would phone me in my room in an hour to arrange it, I didn't get the call. The night before we were due to leave the hotel manager phoned to ask how our stay was, and when I mentioned";3
"Well situated; older but updated; suite had 2 rooms which made it very convenient; expensive but I guess that's normal for NYC! Italian restaurant in the hotel not great but Diner was good & open 24 hours.";4
"I booked 2 rooms, a 2 bedroom double and a queen room. On check in we are advised the beds are not standard beds they are ""small doubles and small queens""  Advised we are being upgraded to a suite - given the dirtiest run down room I've ever seen. Paint peeling, 1 bed has a big dip in it because it's worn out, the other you can feel the springs. Bathroom tiny and no where to put any personal items. No coffee or tea making facilities, fridge groans and then in the middle of the room there is a table with 6 chairs. Walls paper thin. View is a brick wall. Has balcony but it doesn't look safe.  Will be requesting another room -  This hotel is in serious need of repair. I don't believe they should be able to sell the room we are in.";1
A super little (ok massive!) hotel right in the heart of the action. A stones throw from the Empire State, Fifth Avenue and with two great food venues onsite (one is 24 hours) this is the ideal location to call home when you're in the big apple. The rooms are basic yet comfortable, with an amazing shower and comfy bed. Would def return.;4
No free Wifi In the room as we were   promised. We cheked in yesterday (Saturday 7th Oct) and were negativly suprised that there is NO free Wifi in the room we booked (or anywhere else in the hotel!) We where told by hotels.com, the room that we wished to book included free WifiI. I called hotels.com twice to be sure! Free Wifi was a priority when choosing hotel.  Its such a disapointment and not what we expected. we will for sure not pay $ 54,95 for 5 days, which is completely overprised.  The staff is nice but in this matter (not very understanding) they advised us to use the free Wifi at the nearest Starbucks. Well, we will for sure not be spending much time at the Belvedere Hotel the next 6 days we have booked.;1
As a global traveler and a discerner of good food, the New Yorker Hotel in NYC is fortunate to have arguably the best steak restaurant I have ever been to. Just simply the best in the world for me. An Italian restaurant with a large menu but the standout for me is the few choice cuts of steak cooked to perfection. Just brilliant and definitely worth recommending to all travelers to New York City;5
Very disappointed this trip to ur hotel. Was to have 2 queen size beds, had 2 full ones. And to have a view, not of the side of a building. Teny tiny room. Too small for 4 ppl. Couldn’t pass each other in the room. One had to walk and the other had to wait to get by.;4
Really enjoyed our stay here (family of 4 in a queen suite). Very comfortable,room was spotless with fresh towels everyday. The location is the best part about this as its central to most things and theres a subway stop right outside your door.   Special mention to the staff who were so easy to deal and very accommodating.;4
"Actually, location is perfect, you can reach any sites in very short ways, as by walk nearby as by subway in upper / lower Manhattan)  The room size, esp. bed size - are to be re-checked very carefully before you book the room, on the sites everything looks with a little different dimensions...For two persons with luggage there is no space in the room to walk free... and first Hotel for me with no refrigerator in the room!  In general the hotel is comfortable, the view from window very depends of room location, it will be or window to window view in case you get some ""internal"" room either the great view from ""corner"" room we got on 37th floor))  One strange thing we mentioned- permanent food smell in the corridors especially in the morning, probably due to not perfect";4
Lovely staff here+great location. Firstly,myself and my wife arrived and got to our room,unfortunately,it was very noisy with drilling non stop above us,not good after a 7hour flight. So I rang down to reception and asked could we move room because of the noise,I was talking to Mohammed who really looked after us with a bigger room and much nicer view and he also sorted out free breakfast for myself and my wife the next morning in the tick tock diner which was well appreciated. We had an excellent few nights stay to kick start our honeymoon, would recommend this hotel to anybody,it was brilliant and also a big thank to Mohammed for making our stay so good.;5
Just returned from New York and stayed here for 4 nights with my husband. Initially we were a little disappointed because the hotel seemed to be a little dated.  However, that really didn't matter at all, it was clean and in a fantastic location for everything!! The staff were lovely and very helpful, they gave us a few tips on where to go to eat and how to get a few bargains.  There is a 24 hour diner which always seemed busy although we didn't try it. If you are staying room only there is a Mac Donald's and a Starbucks across the road for brekkie. I would definitely stay here again should I return to New York;5
we stayed her for my sisters 60th birthday, we took our daughters, we had a room for 4.the hotel is very well situated near many attractions, it is very old but full of character.very art deco. we had a room upgrade after being told we were not booked in!! not what you want to hear after a 9 hour flight! thankfully mohammed sorted things for us, giving us a bigger room with a view of empire state!! the beds were sooo comfy, room clean, basic toiletries, had wonderful time, weather was good, plenty of eateries nearby, would recommend staying here, would love to go back, thanks again mohammed!!!;5
What a fabulous hotel. Has the wow factor when you are in the lobby waiting to check in. We were there to celebrate our daughters 21st birthday and had a problem with our booking. Not the hotels fault it was the travel agent back home but Mohammed was very helpful. He took time to get the problem sorted and is a huge credit to the hotel. To get in the lifts you have to show your key card to security so a safe hotel.   Rooms are ample big enough for 2 people plus 2 large suitcases and there was plenty of storage space. We took our own travel kettle but one is provided if requested.   Bathrooms are quite small but shower powerful and toiletries replaced every day.  A very central location. We were able to walk most places but the subway and train station is bang across the road;5
had a great stay at this hotel, Staff were very good, in all departments, it is in a very good location, we were able to walk to  many of the places of interest we wanted to see, :ie times sq, Bloomingdales, 5th avenue, macey's, etc. would definitely stay there again.;5
This hotel is situated perfectly if you are a first-timer in New York and are looking to hit all the tourist hot spots. Empire State building a 10 min walk, Macy's just down the street, 30 min walk to Central Park. The High Line isn't far either. We walked everywhere although Penn Street station is next door. As for the hotel, it could do with a bit of an upgrade in the rooms. Room a good size for NY but was a bit tired. Had to ask for amenities like a coffee machine, but when I did they were delivered quickly. Would stay again as good value.;4
"From the moment you step through the doors you are transported back to the Art Deco period. Great levels of attention have been paid to ensuring that the style is not lost - that said there are some elements of the style that would be better hidden, namely the bedroom carpet! Great little gallery of photos from the past on the lower floor which give insight to the hotel's history.  Security is great - good to see that they monitor who comes into the hotel. No room card, no use of the lift and you also need a key card to use the restrooms.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens crisp; however the towels could do with being bigger, just about a standard bath towel size and the shower in our room was a bit leaky? The room was very compact but I guess space is at a";4
We had an awesome stay at the New Yorker it was central to most everything! Our room on the 31st floor was amazing with a beautiful view of the Empire State Building! The room was very clean and modern considering the age of the building. All of the staff we're friendly and accommodating. We will go back and we will be staying there again! Check out the view from our room!!;5
We spent one night at this hotel, the room was good enough for just the night, they need to be updated but everything works fine for us, the shower had some stains on it but besides that room looks clean, the staff is friendly and welcoming the location is the best for our concert night, walking distance from Madison Square Garden we had no issues getting there on and leaving it at late night ! The check out was fast and the let us leave our luggage for an extra fee for all the time we want ! Definitely stay there again;4
love this beautiful retro building situated a block away from Penn station and Pensilvaniana station and as you leave the hotel take right walk to the crossing take a left you see that beauty on 34th street. That is the empire state.   Hotel was clean staff friendly  the Lobby is stunning just grab a second to absorb the grandness of this and also note the retro feel and chandelier of which u can't miss   We had two rooms 35th floor room 3505 amazing views we had a view of the one world trade centre ahead and the Hudson to the right of us and the other u could see the city lit up as well as the View of the Chrysler building.    Beds comfy & clean safe is available and it's free. With a reasonable closet space these rooms are of an adequate size   Bathroom.   I love this shower;5
Breakfast was amazingly chilled and relaxing quiet friendly people all around great out of the blue trip and experience...  The place itself is decorated with a larger than life and The place is clean. would love to come back;5
We really enjoyed our stay here. Our first impression was the front desk and Afroza was an excellent ambassador. We were early and we're able to check our luggage and she called us when our room was ready. The room was much larger than expected and had an Art Deco feel that totally fit the bible of the hotel. Centrally located so we were able to walk everywhere. I would definitely stay here again.;4
I should start by saying that I booked this hotel using my (hard-earned) Wyndham Rewards hotel points, and so considering that I technically paid $0 it was excellent value for money.  That accounts for all of the three stars that I have given it.  However, while I was grateful for the deal, this hotel did not give a good impression..  The hotel room was small (which I would expect for a New York hotel).  The decor, fixtures and fittings were very worn and dated.  The bathroom needed to have been refurbished 20 years ago.  The shower was terrible.  The TV reception was very poor.   There was no room service offering despite what the website says.   The positives:  The best thing about the hotel is the location, which is excellent - right next to the subway, and within easy;3
A lovely place to lunch!  Excellent food with friendly service! You need nothing else to make a very pleasant occasion other than nicer weather so that we could have enjoyed the sea view from the lovely patio!;5
Beautiful historic art deco building with a great location. Right in front of Penn Station and walking distance to Times Square and Empire State. Great, very clean room, awesome bed, bathroom small. Really nice staff.;5
I stayed in a Queen size room for tonight’s and have to say I was disappointed.  Walking in the hotel it is truly impressive and I really only stayed here because of it being a historical landmark and the pictures looked great.  The room was really nice in appearance but the sheets were super cheap almost like wrapping yourself in cardboard.  The price wasn’t cheap so I was surprised  how uncomfortable the bed and bedding were.  The room was clean but the plastic toilet set had really strange and deep scratches on it.  The sink fixtures were worn and looked like it wasn’t cleaned .  The positive about the room the shower was amazing and had some of the best water pressure Ever.  If your looking for a short stay and can get it at a cheap price it’s not a bad place.  Overall the;2
Excellent. Phenomenal service, great overall experience. Large rooms with comfortable bed/bedding. Clean. Staff was consistent and always eager to assist with directions, places to visit, travel options & wonderful stay. I extended my stay another night. Will be returning as repeat customer for business and family travel. Thank you.;4
New York hotel rooms are unfortunately rather small although adequate.   The bed was king size and very comfortable. There was no coffee machine etc., but I always have my own travel kettle with me so am prepared.  We did not eat at all in the hotel as were only there for five nights and wanted to be out and about.  The hotel was only two blocks from the Empire State Building, and Time Square and Grand Central Station  were within walking distance, with Penn Railway Station only across the road.  This is very handy for getting to Newark Airport which is only 30 mins. away.  The staff were friendly and helpful.;3
I booked a suite with a city view for three. It was booked over three months ago in hopes of getting a good room. I called a few days before to make sure we got a view of the Empire State Building.  We checked in around 3pm and were told it was a pretty good room.  When we got to the room on the 39th one window faced downtown and the other window was covered with scaffolding.  The room was small and dark and not what we were looking for.  Being it was one of the guests first visit to New York I thought maybe we could request a nicer room.  I went back to the front desk and talked to Linda.  Told her what we were looking for.  She checked other rooms available and came back with an upgrade to a premium suite.  The normal upgrade would have been $129 a night but would give it to;5
Great place good staff central location had a great time celebrating daughters birthday tick tock diner great American breakfast but the trattatoria not great food very ordinary. 3 rd time here and would come again;5
Excellent location Team very professional, kindness, smile and really helfull to make your stay in NY unforgettable. Excellent Guest Service Large room very well equiped Very good restaurant and Lounge bar;5
The hotel may have small rooms, bot the location and service was great. Mohammed at the front desk helped resolve a booking  issue. The location was perfect for Times Square and Broadway. Very convenient to be able to check bags after checkout and come back for them after another day in town.;4
DOUBLE Bed (not queen or King – two small beds (z beds) and a hollow middle – did my back in and I spent the second night sleeping on the floor.   They offer $10 a day for extra – free call anywhere – wifi, gym and pool --- did not get to gym or pool.   Room was ok and I love 1920 style – its Opposite Penn Station just a walk and well apart from the small bed (I should have complained).  Wifi good.  Big but average hotel.  We stayed as part of a package, so I cannot help with the pricing.;3
With high expectations, we arrived to a 2 night stay at the new Yorker just to find out this hotel is far from being a place you would want to stay in new York. It’s noisy both from inside (constrictions where being made on the floor above us and we called operator, they promised a manager will call us and guess what, no one called) and outside (windows are very thin). The serve from the stuff was lame, slow and very cold and unappreciative and the decor of the hotel, the lobby, the halls and the room are from the 60’s or something. Rooms are with discussing rugs and flees are everywhere. We wouldn’t believe what we saw. It looked like nobody saw the ugliness that going on there. Stay away from this hotel;1
Had a terrible stay. Clogged sink drains, poor sink tap design leading to water splashing all around the bathroom, extremely small bathrooms, and worst of all, water leaking out of the bath area on to the bathroom floor!! Had to use bath towels to absorb the water. Had to switch through 3 different rooms in a 3-night stay. Given the 4 star rating this hotel has, i think it deserves a 0 star review, given even 2 or 3 star hotels fare better in comparison. Would suggest going for other much better hotels in the area available at a similar price point;2
We have stayed here twice and will be staying here again. Location is everything to us. The hotel is very accommodating. They have friendly concierge's service. They have two restaurants.   They have a breakfast cart in the lobby in the mornings that is out of this world good.;5
really disappointed for the money we paid, room was so small, we did not have room to place our two suitcases, complained to hotel we were then given a slightly larger room which was more acceptable, hotel is older and really  needs upgraded, and staff were not very  friendly.;3
Stayed here one night prior to boarding a cruise. Was put into a newly renovated room. Small room, but very nice and clean. Close to many things including Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station. Would stay here again.;4
This has the potential to be a really great hotel but our room was dingy, basic and in need of a revamp (and this was an upgrade on the initial room we were given). The food in the attached diner was unappetising and badly presented but very expensive. Would definitely choose a different hotel next time.;2
Heck in was great as we were offered to wait for a room. This was at 10 AM when checking was at 3 PM. We were called by the hotel to see if all was well, it was. Security was great as they were not allowing vagrants or homeless in. Rom was fantastic. Dining area was great. Only thing.  No coffee pot at room for wake up morning coffee. This was an exceptional stay with no problems;5
We spent the night at The New Yorker for my mom's birthday. The view of the Empire State Building and MSG from our suite was fantastic. The service was even better. I truly appreciate the kindness and care shown to us. My mom had a wonderful birthday.;5
I stayed at the New Yorker on tues the 26th and upon check there was a little mix up with the price I was told a different price when I called to book and the agent at the desk who help me out was very friendly and made some adjustments and fix the issue ... his name is Muhammad  very pleasant and helpful check in wasnt till 4 pm but he let my party and I check in early ... I would recommend this hotel to any the staff was very helpful and friendly as well;5
I want to like this hotel.  It's beautiful inside, and so close to Penn Station.  But the service is not up to par.  A very nice gentleman checked me in, then called me to make sure my room was OK.  I said it was.  In the morning, I found that all of the bath towels were hanging on the door's hook.  I naïvely thought they must be clean, and served there by the maid.  When I put one in my face, it was immediately apparent that they were dirty.  I dried off with a face towel and hoped I wouldn't get sick.  (I did not.)  I also found a room key on a pedestal.  Though I reported it to two managers, it never disappeared from that pedestal in four days.    I went to the reception desk and spoke to a manager.  He printed a sheet and said an investigation would ensue, and that I'd;3
Very expensive for a very basic room, at least the week I was there.  Small room but not unbearably so. No refrigerator or coffee maker, had to request both and then had to pay for refrigerator which was put on the floor because there was nowhere else to put it although it was the typical size for a hotel room. Also had to keep suitcase on the bed because of lack of space. Only one electrical outlet accessible. I expected much more for the price of the room, and some renovation is needed throughout the hotel.  I have heard though that some rooms (the expensive ones) have been renovated.  Excellent location for sightseeing but noisy neighborhood.  Staff was very good and helpful, and you have to show room key to get to elevators which is good security.  Elevators were good.;3
This place has an awesome location and this 30s feel to it. However, it has small rooms, mine facing into a wall and worh no fridge in it. There is also no breakfast and it would use a big refurb as well.;3
The location is great, right next to Penn Station and near times square. Quick check in and the staff were very friendly. The Room was clean and welcoming. We had a great view of the skyline which for me is what you look for in a New York hotel. The bathroom was a little bit rough around the edges but overall fine. The hotel has a lot of history and is an iconic place to stay with its art deco theme. The price is reasonable for the central location. Cheaper places could be found out of downtown or with a budget hotel.;4
It is located in the heart of Manhattan, so very easy to access everywhere.  The personnel is very helpful.  The room is not that comfortable since it is too small. The hotel is very old and should be renovated. Although the it is not allowed to smoke in the rooms, our room was smelling cigarette!;3
The location of the New Yorker was fantastic, very close to Penn Station & Times Square etc. The check in was very quick & the staff were very friendly & welcoming. Rooms were very nicely furnished & big enough for the two of us, we also had a great view of the New York skyline. We did think it was a bit overpriced however & there are much cheaper places to stay.;3
Recently got back from the Wyndham New Yorker, great hotel. Very central, less than 10 minute walk from Time Square. Rooms were very clean and comfortable and spacious and staff were very friendly. There is a safe in the room to store your money, passports ect and also an iron and ironing board which is always a bonus. The Tik Tok restaurant attached to the hotel is definitely worth a visit, the food is amazing. All in all, a very good holiday and would definitely stay here again due to its location and cleanliness.;4
"I chose the New Yorker for its convenient location in mid-town Manhattan and was not disappointed. The hotel itself is a 1930's art-deco masterpiece and still retains its identity with noticeable features in the fixtures & fittings. Stayed for 7 nights on a room only basis as my wife and I planned to eat out most of the time, however, food is available 24/7 in the ground floor diner. Arrived 4 hours earlier than planned, however, the friendly and courteous staff granted us an early check-in. I booked a standard room, as I wasn't planning to stay in much, rather go see the sights and attractions then crawl back back in the evening to sleep in a very comfortable bed. All the mod-cons you would expect with the biggest and deepest bath I have ever seen; bring your rubber ring - it's";5
Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights  The queue to check in at 1am after a transatlantic flight was a pain but not disastrous.  The room itself was absolutely fine - decor slightly dated but clean and workable albeit would have benefited from more power points. However the shower was awful. Low pressure, the wall mounted shower head was at a height designed for the smaller person and getting a temperature between freezing and boiling required movements of millimetres to get the right level. Because of this I wouldn't choose this hotel again  Should note the hotel gym is one of the best I've come across - it is a 'proper' gym suitable for a workout;3
This was our first trip to New York and from the minute we arrived at the hotel we had a blast. Hector was there for us every time we came out the door. He was awesome he helped us get to all of the attractions in the quickest mannor. The  hotel was in a very good location and all of the staff is great. This was our first time to the northern states and we were a little worried. There was nothing to worry about everyone was kind and helpful. Our room was pricey but no more than any other place we visited. The hotel was older but clean it had a lot of character. The view from our room was spectacular. I took pictures out of my window and they were better than the pictures I took at the top of the Empire state building. I would stay at this hotel again anytime. We walked all day;5
Stayed here in May, hotel lobby was amazing as was all the staff including the maids, could not fault the service everyone was very nice and helpful. However the only complaint I would say was the room was very small no room for 2 big suitcases, we did manage to get moved to another room which was so much better, and bigger, the only thing that let it down was the bathroom was very small and very old but it is a Art Deco hotel. The location was fantastic right next to Penn Station and a short walk to the Empire State Building, there is also a restaurant called Tick Tock just off the Lobby great place to eat at anytime.;4
Having stayed at The New Yorker in the past my wife and I elected to use the venue to bring our son & daughter & their families to NYC, a city we've both grown to love visiting over the last 25 years, from the UK to celebrate our milestone anniversary.  It did not disappoint! From making our reservations for 4 rooms & a party of 11 arrangements with the invaluable assistance of Cristina Moya, Reservations Agent, through to John arranging all our transportation needs from & to the airports, and Mohamed at check in, who handled the complex room allocations it was faultless. Mohamed excelled throughout our stay keeping in constant touch to ensure all our needs were catered for - to the extent of arranging Champagne in our (upgraded) suite for all our families members to toast us,;5
We had the best time! The hotel was fabulous...very accommodating and made our stay very special! The staff were friendly and even arranged for us to have champagne sent to our room so that we could celebrate with the whole (eleven of us) family! The breakfast at the Tick Tock cafe was an experience that we all enjoyed! Thinking of NY try this hotel you won't be disappointed!;5
"Advertised as ""metro room"" with a queen bed.  The room was smaller than a cruise ship interior cabin, had no drawers and minuscule shelf space in the bathroom.  No place to put suitcases or other people. Staff was very helpful and location was great.  Being from Idaho I thought the prices were outrageous, but again the location was outstanding for a tourist.  The safe didn't work and took a day to get fixed, but they gave us 2 coupons for breakfast.";2
This is a very belated review ... we stayed almost a year ago!  However, we had a wonderful welcome at the Wyndham New Yorker from Miguel.  It was our wedding anniversary and we were upgraded to a room on the 26th floor.  We were given a complimentary bottle of wine and a huge vase of red roses.  After a very long trip it was a really lovely surprise and our three nights in New York were made extra special by staying in this hotel.  We would highly recommend it and especially for its great location.;5
Photos are from our room. We had a room on 24th floor room 49. Awesome room. They upgraded us. Make sure you get this room. We had two rooms. One with walk in wardrobe and safe. 2 double beds and a tv. The other room had a dining table and chairs, lounge, table , tv and fridge. Bathroom in between. ( it had shampoo, conditioner and bath gel) The view was fantastic. Service was great. Staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms great. Downside ....it would have been nice like they do in most hotels have tea and coffee, milk, kettle, etc the basics so you could make a cuppa tea or coffee instead of going downstairs early in the morning. Also they was no information about the hotel or where you could go or what to do in NY. I know you could go to the front desk but sitting in your room;4
We arrived at our hotel via the subway from the airport which was just around the corner. Upon arrival we were told that our booking had been cancelled due to our card being declined, after a 7 hour flight and 2 hours of queuing to get through customs this was not what we wanted to hear. This was shortly resolved after speaking to a different member of staff Mohamed who checked us in without any problems and also offered us complimentary breakfast for the next morning. Our room for 4, had two double beds with a small bathroom. Iron, ironing board and safe are provided. Housekeeping provided us with a coffee machine when we rang them, another guest in the hotel had told us that we could request this, which was good to know. Rooms were cleaned daily, bedding, towels changed. Hotel;4
We visited this hotel on our last night in NY. Unfortunately our booked room was not available and we were offered two single beds room. However we didn't like the option and were immediately upgraded to a business room. The room was very nice, clean and offered absolute privacy. The hotel is very centrally located and was convenient to get to an airport from (Penn Station). We also used the option to store our luggage for a whole day after a check out which was only $2 for each bag.;5
Stayed for 4 nights. All staff were friendly and helpfully, Tick Tock diner had good fast food. Centrally located. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Our room on the 36th floor had double aspect Windows with lovely views over the city and the Hudson river. Lovely art deco features.;4
Our room was supposed to be on the VIP floor(according to the check in agent). Our shower leaked all over. The floor for 2 days and the toilet was broken.  While someone came to fix it , it was 2 days after our check in. When I asked housekeeping to come clean the floor because I just had rotator cuff surgery and was afraid of falling, they cleaned the floor but refused to come back to clean the room.;1
"Stayed here early September.  The location of this hotel is excellent, it's in walking distance to a lot of New York;s highlights , Times square, Empire State, The Highline, access to loads of subway links from right outside the building to Penn station across the street, also a whole lot of brilliant shopping opportunities from 8th Avenue all the way down to 5th.  The hotel itself is lovely , it;s quite old world which I'm a fan off, if you're looking for a cool modern recessed lighting, snazzy furniture kind of place then this is probably not for you. What it does have though is that feeling that you are in New York, it's authentic, comfortable and the staff are lovely people, all very helpful and informative .  I was a little unhappy with my room when I checked in as I was";5
This was the second time wd stayed here and again we found the room excelkent clean and well stocked and the staff are a credit to the hotel excellent service. Woyld recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a good quality hotel with excellent service.;5
The bathroom was very small, but hey you are in NYC.  The room was very clean and service was excellent.  I also liked the Tick Tock diner in the hotel.  Great food.  Very convenient to everything. Macy's is only about a block away.  Madison Square Gardens is on the opposite corner.;4
When we decided to go to New York we wanted a good central hotel. We searched and searched and finally we decided on New Yorker Hotel. We arrived at the Hotel and were amazed at the attractive lobby. The staff were very helpful, the rooms which were moderate in size, were clean and tidy. At ground floor level we found the Hotel's Tick Tock Diner which opened 24 hours Monday to Sunday. In the morning we found out that PENN Station was just 2 minutes away, so we bought a 7-day Metro ticket to use it throughout the whole week. The Hotel was very close to all amenities and many attractions amongst which Times Square, MACY'S-the largest shopping complex in the world, Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden etc... We found out that the room charge included all local and;5
"Flew into NYC to catch Paul McCartney with a friend.  This hotel was the perfect location; walking distance to Madison Square Garden, Subway system & Amtrak station.  The rooms were large for NYC and clean with one exception...the bathrooms were old and in need of upgrading.  At least they were clean.  I'd stay here with a male friend but I would not bring my wife there for that reason...clean fixtures and upgraded bathrooms are not only desirable, they are essential to hygiene.  The price was quite reasonable too but I'd gladly pay more if they upgraded the bathrooms.";5
this was my first time in New York and at the Wyndham, first impressions very very good, check in staff very pleasant and helpful, we were on the 19th floor not a very good view looking out at another hotel and brick wall .. found the room quite small but very clean, the leading corridor could do with an update too... a let down is there are no tea/coffee facilities offered in the room which is needed after a long journey :(.. the staff are lovely and very helpful especially on our outward journey when we had a taxi organised and this time we were not ripped off as we were when we got the taxi from the airport to the hotel, be very careful as some quote a price and then charge differently when you get to your destination.. would stay here again.;5
We spent 4 days there, for one of our best friend's big birthday celebration.  We waited long time to check into our room.  The rooms were SUPER SMALL!  The lobby was so crowded and very unfriendly UNSAFE.  One of the hotel guests broke my luggage, and I had to discuss with the hotel security to get them to hold her accountable for her careless behaviour.  Evidently, this hotel is indifferent to guests' safety or behaviours.  Only saving grace the doormen were always helpful, and two on-site restaurants were very good, and it is just across stress from the Union Station of Amtrak.;2
Having stayed in this hotel in Mid town New York three times in the last  three weeks in three different rooms. This hotel charges $ 380 dollars per night including taxes on average depending on during the week or weekend. All three rooms are on average 16 feet square with a small bathroom.for this amount of money you would expect a mini bar fridge and tea / coffee making facilities ,well they do not offer. if you do stay here do not fall for the free gift after you check inn . this is for time share at The Windolm Club a time share company within the parent company,who will take you across New York to their new development and you spend at least two hours with a slick high powered selling team promoting their time share options worldwide. The plus with this hotel is their;2
"This was our first ever visit to New York, and was booked to celebrate my wife's Birthday. I had e-mailed the hotel prior to our visit, and upon arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded, and we were not disappointed with our room on the 36th floor with an unobstructed view of the Empire State Building; just what we requested. Miguel on the front desk was excellent and very helpful throughout our stay, especially so when our flights to Florida had been cancelled due to Hurricane Irma, which meant we had to stay an extra 2 days in New York. Miguel assured us that we would be able to stay with them and  that we could also stay in the same room.  The room itself was very spacious, spotlessly clean and the bed was so comfortable. We used both the Tick Tock diner (best ever";5
This is a classic NYC hotel from the gold 30's that still has a lot of the original features. The rooms are confortable (we were upgraded to a suite). They have nice beds, a Keurig coffee maker, good wifi and a walk in closet. The bathroom is good, but small comparing to the size of the room. The staff was very polite and nice as well.   The best thing: the location! Just across MSG and Penn Station, which subway connections to go virtually everywhere. Near several restaurants and bars, as well as great shopping options, like the classic Macy's.  The worst: room service was not up to the quality of the hotel. We asked for breakfast in the room and it came in plastic and papers bags, eggs in an aluminum plate, all cold. Not what tou would expect in a 4* hotel.  I'll definitely;4
Staff were great, very friendly.  We booked a double room with a living room added on for extra space.  Great to find there were two bathrooms in the room, much easier with a family of four. Beds were comfy, my teenage daughter opted for the sofa bed, and slept well.  Housekeeping was good, everyday, the only thing that was missing was a machine to make hot drinks, so I asked at reception and 20 mins later had a machine delivers that did tea and coffee.  We didn't use the ticktock diner, but we did go down and use the take away facility and had coffee and a delicious cranberry muffin in the morning. Overall a very good stay.   I wish the american system in general would give you the price upfront rather than add 'facility fee' taxes on at the end - not a gripe about this hotel;4
From the outside nothing special but inside hotel is beautiful, great location to Penn street station, only 10 min walk, rooms nice, on the small side but finished emaculate, air conditioning too which is a bonus when hot outside,;5
Just returned this morning  from this hotel.  This was our 2nd visit  celebrating our anniversary and can only  say that  we were looked after with our requests.  Check in was quick and easy by Krystle who was very polite and friendly.  We were given an upgrade to one of the newly modernised executive rooms on the 30th floor which had a walk in shower. She also  had a bottle of champagne sent to our room to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The room was spotless  and housekeeping cleaned everyday and left clean soft white towels. There were 3 windows in the room which gave us great views.  The Tick Tock Diner was great for food especially their strawberry cheesecake.  There is a small cafe bar in reception which was great to pop down to in a morning for coffee tea and;5
The location is really nice, very close to Penn Station on 34th Street. Empire State Building is within 10 mins walk. Lots of restaurant and pharma around the area and just 15-20 mins walk to Times Square.  The standard room is good enough for 2.  Not too spacious but comfortable enough. Staff are really nice and friendly.  If you're planning to be out anyway the whole day for tours, then this is just perfect to be your sleeping ground.;4
This is a fantastic hotel in the heart of Manhattan. It is so close to Times Square and is just across from Madison square garden. It is a step into the New York of the 1930's with many original features in the beautiful hotel lobby.   The staff are all excellent so friendly and helpful especially Mohammed at reception and the luggage storage staff, security staff also.  We had an executive suite which was a large modern room with newly designed shower facilities. We flew into Newark and got the air train through to Penn station (took about 30 mins) which is 2 mins walk to the New Yorker and this station can be used to get the subway around Manhattan.  Lots of places to eat nearby whichever your choice or price range. Would definitely stay at the New Yorker again we had a;4
First of all, this hotel has a 'mandatory hotel fee' which made it more expensive (by 15% for me) than what was quoted on Priceline.  If you can get over that (or negotiate it away) the hotel is a really nice art-deco era hotel (opened Jan 1930) with a beautiful lobby .  The 'standard ' room we had was small , like many older hotels in NYC but doable .  If you have one large or 2 carry on size suitcases, you can make it work.  Ask for a coffee maker if you don't have on already in your room, it's a Keruig !  It is right next to Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station which makes it a subway ride to and from JGA ( and a short bus ride) or JFK' s Air Train.  Being on 34th and 8th it is close to Macy's, The Empire State Building, subway  access to almost anywhere and many really;4
This is a classic hotel with a old school touch. Offers a great view of Empire State Buiding and Crystler Building. Walking distance to Times Square and even Central Park. Rather small rooms that need some renovation.;4
Had a lovely stay all hotel staff were helpful and friendly. Room was a little small but good enough for a four night stay it was clean and tidy. Definitely stay again and recommend to friends but if your English don't expect tea and coffee facilities in room but I think they are available if requested;4
New York, New York so good they named it twice, well I can see why,you have everything that you may need on a long or short break, we went on a short break, 4 days, and loved every minute from the friendly people of New York to the hustle and bustle of everyday life,we found the New Yorkers to be extremely polite and very welcoming, the shops, the shows the night life to the Hot Dog sellers on the street till silly times of night were great, you have to remember you are in a city so you pay city prices, with the dollar right up beside the Euro at this moment you don't get no where near the bargains that you got a few years ago, but hey your in New York, there are some bargains around like getting breakfast from a local deli rather than your hotel, about a third of the price, to;5
We have stayed here at least 8 times.. right across the street from Penn Station, rooms are great and clean and we love the Tick Tock Diner and also the Italian restaurant that I can't remember the name of.. we had a fabulous meal there before our show.. highly recommend The New Yorker! Mohamed checked us in and he was wonderful!!;4
The check in was busy but more staff were brought on to deal with the spike. I was given 2 free drink vouchers for the bar which was VERY welcome after travelling for over nine hours.  My room was very small but I was travelling alone and didn't intend to spend much time there anyway. However it was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The shower was spectacularly good - the spray would strip paint from a wall. The wi-fi was reliable for everyday stuff - FB, Twitter, general searches... I didn't stream anything so I cannot comment on that.  There was also a safe in my room for valuables.  Some of the fittings look dated, particularly around the window frames but nothing remotely serious. In fact it adds a bit to the charm of an old 30's era hotel.  I ate in the;5
This historic hotel has been nicely updated.  The room I stayed in was small, but comfortable and well appointed.  The location is fantastic.  Near to all mid-town Manhattan restaurants, transportation (next to Penn station) and cultural events.   Very welcoming and helpful staff.;4
I like the hotel location and we literally walked everywhere. Icon places are within a mile. You can see the Empire State from the hotel. Madison Square Garden is just across the street. Macy's is on the same street. Time Square, Broadway and more. Look for Mohammad if you are checking in. He is a very good guy.;5
Wow! Just below our expectations. Locations is however brilliant. Convenient location close to all major attractions e.g., The Empire State Building, Times Square. Excellent for tourists to save time.   The room was not so great. Very congested for a couple.   Service was okay. Could have been friendly.  Anyway, I would recommend the pizza shop right opposite to the hotel. Extremely delicious and economic survival :-)   Have a pleasant trip!;3
We were doing a New England/Canada cruise out of NY and decided to spend a few nights in the City and see some of the sights. Both my wife and I are originally from Queens, NY and haven't been to the City in a while.  I chose this hotel because my Dad worked there back in the 1930's and I thought it would be cool to walk the floors he walked decades before.  We drove up to NY and stayed with family on Long Island, We left our car there and took the LIRR into Penn Station. The hotel is across the street from Penn Station so it was easy to get to the hotel with our luggage. We got there before 1PM and they had a room ready for us. The hotel is very Art Deco and elegant. Our room was on the 25th floor and we had a view of the West side including the Hudson River. The room was;5
Stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker for my very first trip to New York and found it to be a great base.   Positives   1. Location is perfect, facing Madison Square Gardens, 10 min walk from Times Square, short walk to Empire State etc.   2. Tick Tock diner was fantastic, i got breakfast there each morning, great range of food, cheap, good quick service and friendly staff.   3. Hotel security monitored everyone using the lifts to ensure they had their room key which made me feel safe.   4. The room was clean, modern and did the job.  5. Reception and baggage staff were very friendly and helpful.   Negatives  1. The room is so tiny for 2 people, barely fit my suitcase in, but this is NYC and people live in apartments this size.  2. Pillows are terrible and uncomfortable. My hair;5
My room is a good size for New York hotels . Bed nice and comfy . Air conditioning very good .  Great view of the Empire State from my room .  Lots of banging of doors .  Bathroom very poor , definitely needs updating , not a pleasant experience having to use it .  Not many sockets to use .  Good wifi , mine was free but not sure if you have to pay for it .  Great location. Very busy lobby , busy hotel .;3
My first trip to New York City didn't disappoint!  The New Yorker is a great hotel with wonderful employees. The front desk personnel were courteous and helpful throughout our entire stay. I must admit the rooms were dated and small. I had to call environmental services several times to get the musty smell out of the room. I had allergies the entire time I was in my room, thankfully I was only in there to sleep.  The restaurant downstairs is open 24hours and had a variety of things to choose from.  Hint: if you're coming to Madison Square Gardens for an event, this hotel is just across the street!!! In fact, the New Yorker is within walking distance to a lot of things in the city. The Empire State Building is only a few blocks down the street, the worlds largest Macy's and its;4
The hotel is located perfectly for a stay in New York - 34th and 8th. Very easy to get to from the airport if you do the train - right next to Penn Station. The hotel lobby looks amazing. Check-in was fine. Hotels in New York have a very varied selection of 'additional' taxes that can come as a surprise. My room was on the 19th floor - small - a bit dated but clean and comfortable. No view! Housekeeping staff were very friendly. There is a 24hr diner attached to the hotel - Tick Tock - OK, what you expect from an American diner. Wi-Fi was ok - needed to log in each day. I had roaming on 4G so didn't really need Wi-Fi. Check-out was fine and the hotel will keep bags for a couple of dollars if your flight is late in the day.;3
It's easy to dismiss poor service in New York hotels because people think it's a 'New Yorker' way of saying or doing things. For a highly competitive hospitality market I find some things inexcusable. First, rode in for check in with luggage. The hotel bell captain stood next to us as I grabbed the luggage just to realize this hotel doesn't help anyone with their luggage. Asked bell captain for help with a taxi: he just said 'you can grab it from the street yourself'.  Last these guys have a 4:00pm check in time (very late I think) and even then the room wasn't ready until after 4:00pm!  So in short, I'll never stay here again. Look elsewhere. New Yorkers in hospitality are nice people but some exceptions here. A shame.;3
Lovely hotel.  Lovely staff, lovely position.  Maddison square gardens on your door step.  34th street just 2 minutes away.  Excellent place will definitely return.  Woke up looking at Empire State Building from my bedroom window;5
When we travel to New York, we like to have a hotel in a central location. Last time, we stayed at a holiday inn in Times Square. While that was a fine experience I wouldn't trade it for my time at the Wyndham. The rooms were far more spacious! Room service was of the utmost quality. Most importantly, I don't think our stay would've been as wonderful as it had been if we had not been assisted by Muhammed in the front desk. He was very welcoming and just made the whole stressful ordeal of staying in a new city far easier.;5
This hotel is in a good location and though people are saying it is dated, I think that is the charm they are trying to keep which I think was a nice touch.  After reading the reviews on here I was concerned about the size of the room.  Admittedly they were small but had enough room to put your cases and who stays in the room for too long when you are in New York!  The only thing I would have liked is a kettle and coffee but once you got dressed and went down to the lobby there was a coffee bar.  We had a few meals in the Ticktock and liked it in there.  It might be a good idea to offer guests a discount for eating in the Ticktock or the Italian which is in the hotel.  If you have a late flight they do provide luggage storage so you can make most of your day.   I would stay here;4
Cant beat the location of the hotel for a tourist, however the hotel itself is a bit dated and the rooms could do with a slight refresh.  Because room was quite dated and didnt get much natural light it did feel a bit dirty but i just assume it was old.;4
I love staying at The New Yorker! It's the center for your adventure in Manhattan. If you know how to use the subway system it's even better. Second, the bedrooms views are spectacular, the rooms are very clean and organized, and excellent services. Good luck!;5
Had stayed at this hotel some years ago & found it a bit dated. So, was pleasantly surprised on this trip to find it updated, clean & much better in appearance and atmosphere. Location is great, in midtown close to trains & subways, very convenient, a good value. Would be happy to return to this hotel in the future.;5
Fantastic location, small but clean and fully equipped bedroom. But you don't come to NYC to stay in your hotel room do you? All staff that we encountered were pleasant and helpful. Tik tok diner is delicious and well worth a visit. Would recommend this's hotel;5
Stay here for one night for anniversary trip. About one week before the stay, I get in touch with the General Manager, Ann Peterson and Barry Rauch, Director of Operations to see if they can do anything such as an upgrade to a better view room. No reply from either of them. Even if the hotel is full or reject the request, they still should reply to the email.   When we get there, the lobby is very busy and we check-in to the hotel. The receptionist is OK not much going on. There is a special check-in for Wyndham Rewards but it seems that it is always close when I check-in and check-out. She just checks us in and gives us the key. The room is located at 27th floor. The room is very small like most reviewer mention and very old but it seems clean. The sit on the toilet bowl is;1
The hotel is quite old with very old furniture environment and rooms. I didn't feel comfortable at the first room they put me in so I've asked to move. It felt better but still old and not very clean. I found some hair in my bathroom and in my towels.;3
Stayed here for four nights in a City View Suite Room, after much consideration before booking.    As I was staying in one of the world most interesting metropolises I wanted a hotel with history, a good location and convienient for transport options to and from the airport.  This hotel met all the requirements.  Before booking as a result of people on TA saying their room booking were not honoured, i had concerns over what I was booking and asked the hotel on what floors the city view rooms were located, and got the response that they were on the 26th - 40th floors.  On arrival check out was efficient, for such a large hotel, but I was slightly concerned when told our suite was on the 25th floor.  This concern last until we opened the room door and saw the room and view.;5
This was our first trip to the USA.New York was our destination staying at the New Yorker Hotel.We travelled from Gatwick Airport where checking in was quick and painless.The flight took just over 7.00 hours using British Airways where I must say the service was excellent. When we arrived at JLK airport things were different where it took over an hour and a half to pass through immigration. We then looked for a taxi and found an organised queue of yellow cabs and took one to our hotel.The average fare is around 60 dollars (plus a tip I will talk about tipping later). We checked into our hotel and went to our room. The room was disappointing,dull,outdated and small. Seeing it was late and we were tired we decided to sort things out in the morning.We felt for the money we paid we;4
My second stay at the New Yorker and I was impressed with the improvements that being part of the Wyndham group has given it. Beautiful art deco style, lovely clean room done to a very high standard every day. Staff we very friendly and the manager who checked us in was very accommodating. A very pleasant stay with a regular daily visit to the adjoining Tick Tock diner for a first class breakfast.;5
Very comfortable rooms, excellent attention great service, and its located in the very heart of NYC. It was a really good experience one of my best vacations. I really recomend this hotel. Congrats for the great personal you have!;5
Stayed on 29 August to 5 September I've booked this hotel for one week for my wife Birthday The rooms are very clean and tidy a reasonable size The staff are very friendly and helpful I've got to say my favourite person was Amelia on the front desk She was fantastic person I will definitely book/hotel again I was in a good location and right next door was a cafe call tick tock we had breakfast a couple times people go onto TripAdvisor and look at the hotel for negative reviews I will say they were not anything negative that I can say about this hotel and I was staying in room 2106 and I want to say thank you to the housekeepers for their hard work because they deserve it.;5
It was my very first visit to USA and was a bit overwhelmed arriving in New York. The staff at the check in desk were so friendly and explained everything. The room was small but I understand that is the same across Manhattan. It was clean and tidy so what more do I want? We didn't pay extra for a room with a view but we were on the 26th floor looking down 34th Street towards the Empire State Building. We could also see One World Trade and Chrysler Building. We were in walking distance of many major attractions.;5
Arrived around 19:30 local times after what felt like a week travelling. Queued to get out room key and then was greeted by the receptionist, really not the greeting I was expecting, very little greet at all just a simple 'welcome'. I proceeded to explain that it was my wife and I 10 year anniversary and we had chosen their hotel for our stay (no response) the receptionist proceeded to talk with her colleague. After getting our keys we were collared over to join club Wyndham - thanks for the offer but honestly I'd been travelling for hours on end, wasn't exactly the right time for that.  We booked through a travel agent online and it was made clear on the booking that it was our 10th plus I contacted the hotel before we arrived - on to that, so I tweet at the hotel, waits a day;1
Absolutely loved this hotel!! We were upgraded to a room with a view of the Empire State and it was wonderful!!! The view was beautiful and the room (2 double beds) was not massive but big enough for 4 of us wth bags. The room and public areas were clean and well presented, staff were friendly and the location was perfect. Walking distance from most things in manhattan or right next to the subway if needed. Very close to Times Square without being too close to the madness.   Highly recommend staying at this hotel and will most definitely be staying here myself next time I am in NYC.;5
We had a great stay at the New Yorker, best staff ever and the one bedroom suite We had was great, very clean, fridge, coffee maker in the room, it was just great. I would highly recommend the New Yorker for work, pleasure, sightseeing and shopping, the location is fantastic, honestly the hotel was just right all over.;5
Great location to Times Square. Easy walking distance to the Empire State Building and Central Park. Room was very good and quiet as located to the side of the hotel but with a view towards the Hudson River. Staff very helpful and friendly. Would use this hotel again without a doubt.;5
Have just arrived after a 12 hour journey for a 3 day stay which has been booked since March. Checked into room oh my god disgusting!! It's no bigger than a broom cupboard, bathroom grubby and grimey. Don't even want to walk on the carpet,no tea or coffee making facilities, only upon request and they do NOT have any fresh milk at all in the hotel only powdered was directed to go to drugstore. See duty manager may be able to change rooms tommorow for an extra charge but can't promise, admitted its definitely not 4 star but it's the location you are paying for!!  My sisters room believe it or not, if it's possible is an even smaller broom cupboard than mine!! The room next door flush their toilet and it sounds like it's in room, very noisy , am definitely looking for somewhere;1
My husband and I stayed for a week at the end of August. Miguel at reception kindly upgraded us as we were there during our wedding anniversary.   We have stayed before and the room we were in this time was far better. Our room was an executive room on the 8th floor with an amazing view of the Empire State Building (room 837). It was more spacious than the last stay in a metro room. The room had a much more modern shower room and a coffee maker. The room was kept very clean during our stay.  The best thing about this hotel is the location for the tube/trains. It is also near to Macys and MSG. I also like the fact that you have to show your room card to get in to the lifts. There are a lot of hotels in NYC where security is too relaxed.  The hotel bar/restaurant was open during;4
The check in process was very slow. I had to wait 2 hours to get my room when they kept promising the room would be ready in 30 minutes and it just dragged on. Once in the room it was very spacious because I had the Executive Suite with a living room. The only thing I would recommend is to clean the mattress on the pull out bed. The location was excellent and close to everything in Manhattan and subway right on the corner. For the money you pay I just wish breakfast was included. Overall I would stay here again.;4
The hotel is in a good location. very close to the penn and bus station. Walk a few blocks up, and you will be on times sq. The employees do a great job. The only problem I had was the building, and my room. The AC blows out out moldy or a musty smell. It was not only my room. I noticed it was in the fitness room and the lobby. I was told, try to change the room, but that wouldn't have changed anything, if it was through out the building. The fact is... its a very old building. With a very old duct system that needs changing. Thank god I didn't use the AC, because maybe I would have arrived home sick. I will not be returning, regardless of the location........;2
The rooms were a good size and clean, the view of the Empire State Building from the window was amazing and the museum in the basement of the hotel was excellent and free to get in.  Would stay there again;4
This is a huge hotel...1000 rooms.  Very busy lobby, you will always wait for a lift.... rooms old, dated...bathroom needs total refurbishment.  Tiny wardrobe. No fridge or coffee making facility in the room. But, comfy bed, clean sheets & friendly staff.... Ok position in New York....very busy part of town.... ok for a couple of nights. But the whole place needs a makeover!!;3
Location is great. It's the staff though that make this. HOUSEKEEPING were unreal, bringing me a travel adapter when mine broke..and they had to search to find one..but they did it..and then they left it in my room! Check in was Brilliant too. Rooms lovely and clean and the hotel is all 1930's Art Deco, for a history of  it's build,  head to the basement !;5
NO TEA OR COFFEE IN THE ROOM a basic item that is available in rooms all around the world! hotel has a great history as can be seen in the lobby of past guests we had a std room having came here from a big room in vegas this room and our friends room was not big enough to open 2 suitcases in at the same time! it was clean and tidy and the aircon worked but extractor fan in bathroom did not and where the room was so small its not very nice to be in after using the toilet especially if you have had a dodgy $1 hotdog off the street corner!;3
Great hotel location and decorated in Art Deco style rather than modern. Spacious room upgrade provided by Mohammed giving us 2 bathrooms which made mornings much easier. 24 hour Tick Tock diner attached to hotel and was great for a big breakfast before heading out. All staff friendly and informative to help with directions wifi etc. Mcdonalds and Starbucks across the road if Coffee is your only preference. Great view from our room on 26 floor.;4
The hotel is nice, great location, clean and comfortable. A good base for exploring NY. The best part of the hotel however, is the staff! They go absolutely above and beyond to make your trip an enjoyable one. As it was my first time in the US I emailed The New Yorker, requesting a room with a view and that is exactly what we got.. a fantastic view of the skyline of NY and The Hudson River (definitely worth an ask to avoid a view of the buildings opposite). We were so appreciative of this, it really made our holiday! Later in the trip my boyfriend sadly got food poisoning (NOT from The Tick Tock diner, that was great!) The New Yorker were amazing, so so helpful and caring. As he was ill on our day of departure they allowed us to keep our room until 5 o'clock, free of charge!;4
Nice room on the 33rd floor with view of Empire State building.  Large, clean 2 bedroom great mattresses and lots of pillows!  Easy check-in, close to blue line, A C E. Security at elevator.  Across from Madison Square Garden.;5
"The property is old, so the rooms are very tiny - tinier than others I've experience in NYC.  On the plus side, they took most of the available space for the shower; on the minus side, the toilet was difficult to use without hurting yourself on the toilet paper holder, the wall, and the sink (potentially all at the same time).  The bed was comfortable, but the tv was off to the side, so difficult to view from the bed.  The safe was too small for more than a laptop, but there was a safe.  We were sucked into a ""free breakfast"" presentation at a ""new Wyndham property"" not far away, so we thought, why not?  But it turned out to be a very aggressive timeshare sales pitch and the ""breakfast"" was a sad showing of a small scoop of scrambled eggs, a couple pieces of bacon, and a small";3
"Overall a great experience. I couldn't be more pleased with the level of service; friendly and helpful staff; location ; and amenities. The entire staff was awesome, from check in to concierge to housekeeping. Anytime a member of staff would see us in the hallway, they never failed to greet us and feel as if you really are a guest, not just someone renting a room.";5
stayed here when we went to a conert at MSG. clean, beautiful exceptional service! tick tock diner attached to hotel. great stay will definately go back.if you stay in NYC stay here, you wont be dissapointed;5
We recently stayed for 3 nights at the New Yorker. Lovely hotel in convenient but noisy area of Manhattan. We chose one of the renovated rooms due to the age of the hotel and  previous bad experiences staying in old Manhattan hotels. It was a good size, nice bathroom and updated amenities. Staff members are generally friendly and helpful. I am giving an 'average' rating because of a few things: very long check-in process with not enough staff, un-flushable toilet which took 2 phone calls and a 3.5 hour wait to get a response for maintenance to fix it, and a surprise Facility Fee daily charge of $30 +tax not included in the reservation confirmation.  This is being credited to my credit card after me writing to a manager with details of my reservation: the registration clerk on;3
Stayed here while in New York for 3 nights. This place grew on me over them days.  At first my impression was bad, nice decor downstairs in lobby however the room was so so small that suitcase didn't fit in properly when we was both in the room, the bathroom was very dated and the old fittings hadn't even been removed when changed. Was quite dirty too.  However as the days went on I loved the diner located inside the hotel and the staff were nice too especially when we had an issue in our room it was sorted out almost instantly.  Good location however I was concerned about how safe it was around there.;3
Great location. the walls were extremely thin. The bathroom had no locks. And it was dark inside the room. Despite lights. But nearer to Transit railroad and metro. Great service and ability to drop off luggage if you are early.;4
Loved this Art Deco hotel, all staff from Reception, Concierge & Domestics are very helpful (cheery Maggie was very patient in cleaning our room when convenient to us).  Public transport close by and Tick Tock Diner is great for breakfast before heading out for the day and a much needed cup of tea & cheesecake before retiring for the night.;4
Stayed with friends for 5 nights recently. It's been 10 years since I last stayed here and it has had a massive upgrade. Our room was on the 27th floor with great views of the river. Large, comfortable room which was spotlessly clean and had loads of space and storage. The attached Tick-Tick diner was open 24/7 and was good value with a great range for food for breakfast.   The location is great - 5 minds from Penn Station and Macy's and 10 mins from Times Square. Lots of bars, restaurants and shops in the local area too.;4
Just spent 4 nights here in this famous hotel. Staff are  always helpful and friendly especially the young chap who checked us in early ( 2 hours) and upgraded us to a better room. Room was always very clean and spotless. Hotel is in a great location with a restaurant attached (Tick -Tock) and close to the Penn station / Subway. Free Wi-Fi in lobby and also in our room. The hotel is not perfect but I'm not one to slate it because maybe the bathroom tiles are slightly different or paint is chipped !!  Would I stay here again ??  Most definitely.;5
We stayed here in the last week of August and honestly, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating!! When we arrived, our room wasn't ready, so the lady at the desk kindly gave us a room upgrade, we stayed in Nicola Tesla's old room. It was clean and served its purpose, to sleep and chill! There was a working television with access to room service. The only thing that wasn't there when we arrived was tea and coffee making facilities however, once the staff were notified, they brought this facility up to our room and apologised for the inconvenience. Great location also, just a 2 minute walk to Penn station subway!!!;5
We stayed at the New Yorker end August 2017 on our first visit to New York. The lobby was very modern and very busy, and in a great central location. We got checked in fairly quickly and upgraded to a view of the water ( which you could just see from the window if you squinted). The room and corridors look a bit tired and could def do with a lick of paint. The room itself had 2 small double beds and a small dated bathroom ( the hot water for shower was extremely hot, you had to turn it on slightly) . Would have benefited from a kettle, had we known they were not provided would have bought one with us. Saying that the room was clean and our beds made every day. We did have to ring down to reception one eve due to the swearing in the next room ( my 13 year old could hear every;3
This hotel is in agreat location with plenty of restaurants and shops close by and the Empire State Building is within easy reach as is Penn Station.  Upon arrival we were very impressed by the lobby area, although it was ALWAYS very busy - I think passers-by came in for a cool down because the Air Conditioning was very good.    We were checked in very quickly by a polite member of staff.  As it was my Wife's birthday and our Wedding Anniversary during our stay, I had already emailed the hotel and asked them if there was any chance of an upgrade.  When we were checking in we were informed that we had been upgraded to a larger room with a view of the Empire State Buiding.  We were happy about this and also glad as the room we were given was not that large and I wouldn't have;3
The hotel itself is in a prime location next to Madison Sq Garden & Penn Station. Just a ten minute walk to Times Square. We were checked in by a very personable receptionist, I cannot remember his name but he upgraded our room floor and view which was good of him. The hotel room was adequate but the bathroom was small and the shower did not work correctly - it had very little pressure and the temperature was hard to maintain - either scoldingly hot or freezing cold. There were two occasions when we encountered cockroaches in the room. The toilet in the bathroom also made a loud squeak every time it was flushed.  In terms of the area around the hotel, it is littered with homeless people and drug addicts. It really is not a pleasant place to walk around - especially after dark.;3
Flew in from Chicago Illinois for a business meeting. Stayed here for only 1 night. The room wasn't the greatest. Stayed 2116. Needs to be updated. Lots of small dents in the wall. Felt like a MOTEL not a hotel. However, the staff was excellent. I wasn't feeling well, and they gave me a later check out and the security guard Danny Gonzalez was absolutely extraordinary. Very well mannered and attended to all my needs. If I stay again, I would only come back because of how professional and friendly the staff were;3
We paid $126 a night,  for that rate it was an OK hotel.  It's on the older side. The bathroom is just big enough to have one person standing in it at a time.  It had some kind of red dirt could be blood running down the door jam of the bathroom.   Not the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in. The location I think is the biggest draw for this hotel it's a great location,it's central to everything. I would stay again only if I had a very good rate again.;3
What an amazing hotel, couldn't wish for anywhere more beautiful! We had a very pleasant stay and have stayed here twice. It is in a perfect location near to the Empire State and Macy's. The room was large and spacious and the beds were so comfortable. Couldn't recommend enough!;5
On 8th Avenue between 34th and 35th Streets, this is a location hard to beat.  The front desk staff were all helpful and friendly, the room was very clean, well decorated, comfortable and quiet, the Tick Tock Diner in the lobby is open 24/7, and the business center lets you print out boarding passes.  An unusual plus is the lower lobby with a fascinating exhibit of the early days of the hotel in the late 1920s and early 1930s with its enormous barbershop, 90 switchboard operators, and many celebrities!  Worth taking the escalator down to visit this exhibit.  We will be back in New York City in a few months and have already booked our next stay here.;5
I love this hotel. It is really nice and cosy. I like our room because we had a really good view of the Empire State Building. When you wake up we can hear horns beeping and sirens from outside. It is in a really good location too, and it is easy to walk to Central Park. Opposite this hotel is McDonald's, so if you want o be up really early to do everything you can then you can just go to McDonald's and go out! There is also a really nice dinner in the hotel. I had chocolate pancakes for breakfast and the were so big I only managed one half. They have lovely staff in the Tick Tock Diner. By Rosie age 10.;5
"The view from our hotel was probably the best I will ever experience.  We had a suite on the 22nd floor with balcony. The second bed was a sofa bed but it was good quality and the kids slept well (often this is not the case on these types of bed).  The hotel is on the same street as Macy's and the Empire State Building which are within 2 minutes and 7 minutes walk respectively. Penn Station metro and Madison Square Garden are just on the opposite side of the street.  The main diner ""Tick Tock"" is open 24 hours. Food and service are acceptable - don't expect anything more than a standard menu.   Breakfast for 2 shunts and 2 young children was costing around $50.  The hotel restaurant - ""Trattoria Bianca"" - is also acceptable. The fillet ($28) was not the best if I'm being honest.";4
The Wyndham New Yorker is a hotel I like very much and I keep staying there.   Pros: Cheap. Excellent staff. Great diner and bistro. Almost adjacent to Penn Station. Cons: Small rooms even for NYC. Long wait to check in. Crowded lobby.   Nikola Tesla discovered AC electricity in this historic hotel.;3
We booked the Hotel  via Booking.com for 7 nights. We selected this hotel for its location   in New York.  Port Authority bus station (5 minute walk) , Penn station directly across from the hotel (by train to washington) and Empire state/macys/Time square all within easy walking distance.  Hotel art deco style. Check in good and fast .  Room was a queen room on the twentith floor and on the small side . The  room was clean and had fresh towels every day. The room service staff did an excellent job keeping the room clean and was always friendly and polite.The bathroom was a disappointment with the fixtures and fittings requiring urgent replacement.Security in hotel was good everyone having to show room key before accessing the elevators. Bonus feature for us was luggage feature;4
This is a big beautiful old building located steps from Penn Station and Times Square. Hundreds of dining and entertainment options right outside the front door! We had a child with us, so Shamagne, the wonderful front desk attendant, checked with the manager, and offered us an upgraded room to accommodate the crib (which was promptly wheeled in to our room a few minutes later!). BIG thanks the Shamagne for that, as even the larger room was pretty small - lifesaver!  The lobby and common areas are beautiful. Our floor was recently renovated, so it was very clean and up to date. Our experience was great!;4
I was reading a few hotels reviews before we arrived and was a little worried. Well honestly it was fabulous, great location, old school hotel packed with history. Yes the rooms are small, yes the rooms are a little dated and yes it could have better amenities, like a better gym or pool. BUT and there's a big but........so what it doesn't.   The hotel has a great location close to most of NYC's top attractions and therefore perfect for 1st timers or return visits.   We had a family room with 2 double beds on the 27th floor (see below photos) great views. Not sure although the chap that booked us in did say we had an upgrade if we did or not as I personally think we had that room anyway !   Staff are helpful and yes you have to pay to store your luggage. $2 per item. Can't see;4
"Easy walking distance to all local attractions and right next to a subway station for visiting further afield. Comfortable hotel, spacious rooms, professional staff, not disturbed by other guests or by noise from outside. Clean and well equipped rooms. Had to pay a ""resort fee"" even though we never used gym or business centre but it was worth it for excellent wifi and good selection of tv channels. On site diner open 24 hours and coffee bar / takeaway in foyer but loads of restaurants, shops and take always on the doorstep";4
"Great hotel with the ideal location especially for bus or train travellers. Located within easy walking distance from both Port Authority and Penn Station, this hotel is also near various subway lines, making it simple to get around the city. The rooms are very clean and nicely renovated with good space and the lobby is impressive. The employees are pleasant and there was sufficient staff at all times that there wasn't an unbelievable wait for anything; check-in, check-out, information, assistance. Our room had amazing views of the skyline and there were plenty of windows so you could see plenty of it. We would definitely return to the New Yorker when we are next in the city and we recommend it to anyone who wants a clean, inviting room with easy access to mutiple travel options.";5
Nothing went wrong, and it was good to have a place to store luggage while we explored NYC after checking out. The room was small, but we needed no more.  Never used the TV set.  The bathroom was in good shape and lots of hot water in the shower.;5
Ok, so it's in a good position for Macy's/Penn Station. And that's the positive. The hotel is tired beyond belief. Painted tiles in the bathrooms. Upkeep of the hotel leaves a lot to be desired...but I guess the staff are just polishing a turd!!! Tiny rooms, and I know the rooms in NYC are never that big. You can here the TV/music coming from the room next door. Drab corridors. No tea/coffee makers in the room. Seriously this hotel needs major investment. It's Art Deco style isn't for me and I think the last time it was painted was in the Art Deco period.;2
My mother and I have stayed at the New Yorker on our annual visit to NYC each year since 2002, and we're consistently pleased. Rooms are decent-sized by NYC standards and the upper floor rooms are relateively quiet. We both slept well. The location can't be beat, especially for those arriving or departing by train from Penn Station.;5
"Booked this hotel through Thomas Cook in Deal Kent. This trip to NYC was supposed to be a birthday present for my partners 65th birthday But ""That"" was a mistake to start with as the agent recommended this hotel to us but she had never stayed there, yes it's central to all attractions and right next to Penn Station and Maddison Square gardens but after you admire the outside of the building you expect great things, and to be honest the main foyer to the hotel is full of Art Deco beauty but that's where it finished. The front of house staff were rude and arrogant also we were not told we would be stung with a $220 compulsory bill before they would give us our keys, this was to cover cleaning the room, use of conference facilities, wifi and use of the gym. Why the hell do I want";1
This hotel was good but not great my pillows were not clean and my room was never cleaned so I complained to the front desk but they ever came back to me but the good things about the hotel was the great food and drink I had their and also another good thing was there nice service but that was about it;4
What a great location to stay in Manhattan. The hotel is centrally located and we were able to walk to so many places in the city. The staff was spectacular. We got a room on Wyndam points actually had a suite. I would certainly go back there especially because of the location.;4
"I had to take an early train out of Penn Station so The New Yorker was the perfect place to stay and the rate was great for a Friday night during the summer. The front desk got a couple of my requests wrong. They forgot to put my sister on the reservation and they put me on the 38th floor despite asking for a room on a lower floor. But they had upgraded me to a larger room and the views were spectacular so I cannot complain! The room feels a bit old and worn but clean. I liked the security at the hotel -- they were vigilant when it came to checking to make sure everyone who approached the elevator had a key. The people who staffed the front desk were friendly, efficient and patient. So while the room was more on the ""just okay"" side, why would you go to Manhattan to spend a lot";3
I stayed at the New Yorker hotel for 3 weeks on business and I just want to say that Samira and Muhammad at the front desk were extremely polite and helpful in making my stay a comfortable one.   The hotel has a great iconic feel to it. The staff are friendly. The views are great. The neighbourhood is exciting without the touristy feel of Times Square.;4
My husband and myself stayed here for 3 nights on our honeymoon. Hotel was lovely staff were friendly and welcoming. Rooms clean and cleaned every day with fresh towels. Room maybe a bit on the small side but can deal with it since your not there to spend time in your room. Had lovely views was able to see the Statue of Liberty. Walking distance from Empire State Building and Times Square. So found it a great location. Would stay here again.;5
New Yorker is one of the oldest hotel in NYC. Right opposite of Madisson Square and close to a lot of shopping store. Its only 6 blocks away from times square and 4 blocks from Empire State Bldg. Dont expect to much as the room size is small.;4
Stayed here for 3 nights as a family of 4. Arrived before designated check in time but staff were happy to put our baggage in secure storage while we went off and explored the city. Check in with Mohammed of Guest Services went smoothly and he allocated us a good sized room with a river view (just) on the 22nd floor - thank you! All staff were friendly and professional but be warned of the young lady in the lobby offering the free hop on/off bus rides and breakfasts - she is trying to get you on a promotional visit to a sister hotel somewhere in NY but the catch came when she asked for $40 from us to secure our place, presumably to stop us backing out. Her attitude cools considerably when you tell her you are no longer interested! Our room was not overly large compared to other;4
We arrived on a Wednesday afternoon by car.  Unloaded our luggage out front of the hotel dodging bikes (there's a bike path directly in front of the hotel- so bazaar). Our room was not ready so we were asked to come back at 4.  They held our luggage for us and we went our for a walk.  The location of the hotel is really great.  We walked to Time Square and did some shopping in the area.  We arrived back at the hotel at 5.  The room we booked a month before (queen suite with a view), was not only not ready, it was unavailable.  We are a family of 5 (3 exhausted children - 8, 11 and 13) and no room.  After an additional 1/h hour we were greeted by the manager who informed us that the room I had booked with a view was not available that night but she would move us the next day.;4
Stayed here for three nights the room was very good spacious but no view of city just inside the rear courtyard, conveniently placed for most attractions and good bars and diners all close by tick tock restaurant attached , clean well presented and friendly staff;4
We visited here as part of our 10th anniversary. I requested some beer for our room as a present for my husband. What they provided went above and beyond. They couldn't have done any more to make our stay more perfect. We had a room which had a balcony and the most amazing view. It was situated about a 20min walk from Times Square. It was next to both train and tube station.  Thanks to all involved in our stay.;5
Stayed here for 5 days over Christmas 2016 for my moms 50th birthday celebrations. This was our first trip to New York and this hotel was recommended to us by friends who had visited before. We were not disappointed with our stay. After arriving at the hotel we were welcomed warmly by the reception staff who quickly checked us in and upgraded our room. As it was my moms birthday we were given a free bottle of champagne. The room was amazing. Two huge double beds with a sofa as well. There was a much needed Nespresso machine and the pods were refilled daily. There was plenty of wardrobe space and a safe to keep valuables. The cleaning team were brilliant and our room was cleaned daily with bedding being changed regularly whilst we were there.  The hotel is in a great location;5
Of all of the hotels in NYC, I would stay somewhere else. The room we were in was very small. The ceiling in the hallway is maybe 7' tall, but seemed lower and, the hallway to our room was narrow with a lot of turns.    Valet was quick. The location is ok, depending on what you are in the area for and where you need to go. Walking to Times Square for example, is approximately a  20 minute walk.   The restaurant downstairs of the hotel is great and very busy, at least when I was there.;2
4 of us had a double double room 2 weeks ago.  I wasn't expecting the room to be spacious as it is NY after all but it was not as boxroom as I anticipated.  To be honest, we didn't spend much time in the room so it wouldn't matter anyway.  The location is th best thing about this hotel.  It is minutes walking distance from most midtown sites and easy access for several subway lines, Penn station and the PATH to NJ.  The building itself has a cool history and tries to maintain the Art Deco vibe but is is a bit tired in places.  Overall I would go back for location and price was better then similarly located hotels.  Nothing about it was offensive, it just wasn't amazing.   However remember you are in NYC, you shouldn't spend much time in your room!;4
Impressive building with history that's a good base to explore from. A few annoying bits are the elevator system, particularly at check out with up to 20min waits to get down to the lobby and also the relatively high facilities charge. But otherwise a perfectly acceptable room and hotel.;4
This is a great hotel near the penn station so for traveling it is very easy to get to, great location for just about anything. The rooms were good sized for NY also clean. The staff friendly and helpful as well. Our friends at tourico got us a good price . We enjoyed the food downstairs and the broadway show we came to see. Check it out you will like it.....;5
I liked the hotel. It is in a great location. However, it did feel old....like it needed a refurbishment....it's not very modern....my toilet in my room was designed for a child.  It is walking distance from most of the city tours and amenities.....Madison Square garden was around the corner.  No a bad option for centrally located hotel.;3
"This hotel knows that you will only visit once and therefore seeks every opportunity to extract additional cash: beware the ""facility fee"" charge slipped under your door sometime during the middle of the night...questioning this unexpected charge, you will be blandly told that it is all made quite clear in the ""paperwork"", don't expect them to mention it at check in though. Then there are the queues...queues to check in, queues to check out, store your bags (for a fee, of course), queues to collect your bags, speak to the polite but oh so indifferent staff, queues are the New Yorker way. However, room, facilities fine but, worth the hassle? Not sure...";2
I had a few days of business very close to times square and ended up booking The New Yorker simply as it was cheaper than other options. On paper this hotel is really cool - it's a landmark building with significant history, it has impressive architecture, and its super central location is perfect for tourists visiting NYC for the first time.  However, for me as someone who's already sick and tired of New York coming on business and wanting to get out as soon as possible, this wasn't ideal, though I'm not sure any other hotels in this area would be.  The good: cool historical landmark building. Pleasant staff that stays patient despite pretty tough working conditions. Rooms are clean and reasonably well kept, and of acceptable size (for New York). Wifi was OK. Location ideal for;3
The New Yorker wasn't on the top of my list, but it will be in the future. It's old, like me, but looks and lives great for her age. We were given an upgraded room without asking (larger, by New York standards, the pleasant lady smiled) and it was more than suitable for the two of us. We had a view of the Empire State Building, there were subway stops going everywhere within steps of our front door, and best of all, the Tick Tock diner was open 24/7 in the lobby with good food at reasonable prices. There was good security, extremely friendly staff and touches of a bygone era that added to its charm. We couldn't have been more pleased.;5
The room overall was good, a lot of reviews complain about the size, but its a good size for NYC and you likely aren't spending a lot of time in your room anyway!  The location is close to subways which is good but its very crowded as you are right near Madison Square Garden. The walls were paper thin though and I could hear the TV next store at all hours.   Plus its a big hotel so you are always waiting a long time for crowded elevators. I had a great Hotels.com price so it was worth it, but I wouldn't choose it again.;3
Myself and wife stayed here back in May for 5 nights to celebrate her 30th Birthday. The best thing about the hotel is its location. It is right opposite Madison Square Garden (we had tickets to a basketball game whilst there) and Penn Station so due to the Metro System you're only minutes away from anywhere in the city. We either caught the subway or walked everywhere - we must be the only people to visit New York and not use a yellow cab! 5th Avenue with all it's shopping, Times Square, The High Line, Central Park etc are all walking distance from the hotel.  Our room was pretty standard (bathroom could do with updating) but who spends much time in their room when visiting New York - for us the location made this the perfect hotel for us. We used the Tick Tock Diner a couple;5
The New Yorker is central to New York, a short walk up to Broadway, Maceys for abit of shopping or Empire State Building. Central to everything in New York. We did the Hop On Hop Off tour, a easy walk to where you catch the bus. There is a little museum downstairs at the hotel where you get the history of the hotel and  pictures of well known people from the past who ave stayed. Rooms are clean and great to stay in. Close to food outlets and the station.;4
Easy walking to Empire State Building, Time Square, Macy's and the subway to 1 World Trade and Central Park is right around the corner. Building is older and shows it's age, but kept up with nicely. Rooms are small, but it sounds like most hotel rooms are here. My families first time in New York and we stayed 3 nights on the 30th floor overlooking the Hudson River and really never had a problem. The location is a huge plus. Tic Tock Diner on the corner and a CVS across the street open 24 hours. Walking back from Time Square at night felt safe and taking the subway around was really easy and affordable. Many options for parking nearby - I used bestparking.com and pre-paid with no issues. I would definately stay here again.;4
When we checked in we were given a room on the 34th floor, it was the smallest room I've ever seen, not even enough room to manoeuvre a suitcase across the room. The entire room is in desperate need of an update. We complained at the front desk and they gave us a new room on the 19th floor. This room was bigger but still had the same dated furniture. The bathroom was terrible, there was no room to put any toiletries and the shower was poor. Not worth the money;2
Stayed here for 1 night and wish we stayed longer. Friendly staff, Big sized suite, rooms were clean, comfortable bed and pillows, quiet/good sound proofing - very good value for money in the centre of NYC.;5
The hotel is in such a great location.  Old, but lots of history!  Staff very friendly and accommodating.  Close to the subway, Macy's and a nice walk to Times Square as well as Chelsea.  It's location means it's an easy trip north or south!;5
We stayed here for 5 nights at the beginning of August, I can safely say anyone coming to this hotel will not be disappointed, it is beautiful decorated the rooms are very clean and plenty of room my husband and I and a 18 year old stayed in one of the metro rooms and it was big enough with plenty of room for clothes with a walk in wardrobe. The rooms were cleaned everyday and the staff were all friendly. The location is excellent with everything a short walk away. We had Breakfast a couple of times in the Ticktock restaurant, although pricey it was very nice, again great staff and good food. Next time we are in NY this is where we will stay and we will be recommending this hotel to our friends;5
My daughter and I stayed at the New Yorker ( a Wyndham Hotel) recently. The economy nightly price was great but they do hit you with a 70$ resort fee which actually bumps your nightly price up to about 150$ per night.  I must say that I was shocked at the VERY small room size( emphasis on SMALL). Our bed was supposed to be a queen size but we are quite sure it was a full. The bathroom was so small that if my husband had been with us, he would not have been able to use the toilet. That being said, the hotel itself is truly in a great location and the staff were wonderful. From the front desk for a very smooth check in/check out to the housecleaning staff who were very accommodating. The room was immaculate too. They have a green policy for sheets and towels. The location is;4
My husband I went to New York for a one night stay to see the musical  Beautiful.  I found the best rates on booking.com for the New Yorker.   What a great stay.  All staff were friendly and helpful.  There is a 24/7 diner on the premises.  All the rooms were clean and comfortable.;5
After a bit of a rough start in trying to communicate with the hotel after having made the reservation, the hotel made everything right - and then some. Our kids were treated like royalty, we had a wonderful view of the city, the hotel's location is convenient to anything in midtown, and the hotel felt very secure with security preventing anyone from entering the lobby who didn't have a room key.  Overall a great stay!;5
"Stayed just overnight, but it was enjoyable.  We were checked in by a wonderful woman - I wish I had written down her name - but she was great!  She upgraded our rooms (we didn't ask) and my son and I got to stay in the Nikola Tesla Room!  Since my son is a physics nut, it was perfect!  The room was small (it is NYC after all!) but quiet and the beds were very comfortable.  A beautiful view of the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and a bit of MSG.  A small issue with the shower head - the adjustable part was broken and it was stuck on ""pins and needles"" water flow, which was a little painful!  It is an interesting hotel with it's historical info tucked down by the gym.  The hotel itself was different with lots of twists and turns in the hallways to get to some rooms.";5
A great hotel experience in a terrific NYC location.  The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and the rooms are clean and comfortable.  Good value for the money.  This hotel is great for business travel as well as for family / vacation stays.;5
Visited NYC for 3 days last week with my family including my 87 year old mother. After a 12 hour trip we arrived at the hotel around 10am but check in time was not until 4pm. We intended to drop our bags off and sight see until check in time but my mother was very tired. The front desk person Mohammed was very compassionate and understanding. He allowed us to check in right away- without charging the early check in fee-because of my mother. He also provided us with an upgraded room with a view. It was a wonderful reception after such a tiring journey. Thank you Mohammed for caring you are a good ambassador  for this hotel. My family especially my mother are very appreciative.;4
"Unfortunately I was not pleased with the quality of this hotel.  The lobby was filled with a cigarette smoke like scent and while I sat and waited for my room for hours I spoke with a very drunk woman and another (not drunk) woman who was "" killing time waiting for a bus to Philadelphia."" The check in process was overwhelming, with a long line that lead to three visibly stressed front desk agents. Check in time was 4pm and as an 11am arrival, they made sure that I checked in at 401pm. It felt like a line at the meat market that never ended.  Keep in mind that this property is right next to the train station so the transient traffic is unreal. When I finally got my room key I was told that I was upgraded to a double  room with a balcony. Well, the excitement vanished when I";2
This was a block away from Penn Station and MSG - people were friendly, helpful and the accommodations were clean throughout.;5
"I have been staying at the New Yorker since 1968, it was sad when it closed for a while , its fantastic again now, it's my second home. I love the atmosphere and the ambiance of the building and staff there, it is without equal. Enjoy your stay there. I have had many trips here, the"" When did you travel"" box does not cover the dates I was there.";5
Firstly note from JFK the taxi should only be about $65 ..... we were charged over $100 our own fault but do check. Hotel has a good  midtown location most places of interest are within walking distance. Hop on/ off buss about 15 minutes walk. Check in was fast & to our delight we were told we were getting a room upgrade to a view Ha ha .... such a joke, 22 floor and the tiniest strip of river amongst ugly looking buildings. Our room was small for three with two small double beds & a bathrooms. It was directly behind the elevators so noise all night long. No choice but to pay nightly for facilities $22 per night giving wifi & gym access. Would only recommend this hotel for it's location. Note we got immediately nabbed before we even checked our room out to do a 90 minute  tour;3
We would really give this hotel a three and a half out of five.  This hotel is all about the location which is right in the heart of New York and with a five minute walk from the Empire State.  The rooms are ok,  the bathrooms are old fashioned but have a great shower, and our bed was on the knackered side of acceptable.   Get a room as high up as possible, the lower floors will be very noisy, and ask for a room with a decent view, the first room we were given was tiny and had a lousy view so we complained, and hey presto we were given a nice big room on the 31st floor looking directly at the Empire State.  We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and found the staff to be particularly helpful, but our review would be far less positive if we had stayed in our original room.;4
The central location made getting around Manhattan easy.  We loved the Art Deco style and the hotel museum in the basement was very interesting.  Penn station and MSG are right there.  The start of the highline is a couple of blocks away.  Great New York style pizza at NY Pizza Suprema just down the street. The Tick Tock on the ground floor was great for breakfast.  There is also a convienient vending area for quick breakfast items.  We also enjoyed a nightcap at the Trattoria Bianca.  Mohammed was very helpful at check-in and was able to hook us up with a larger room with a Kurig.  Just like the Waldorf Astoria, the New Yorker has a long history and you should expect the rooms to show their age, but it was a great place to stay and I'm sure that we'll be back.;4
Love the location and my room had a fantastic view of the Chrysler and Empire State.   Room was a good size with two Queen beds and nicely decorated. The corridor from the lift to my room really needs a refurb as the carpet was a tad worn and didn't smell as fresh as it could have.   The lobby does get very busy, so, allow extra time for checking out, or, any enquiries where you may have to go to the front desk. The staff work flat out to process people as fast as they can.   The gym is on the lower ground floor, pretty well equipped with loads of space.    Inhouse deli also useful.;4
"Great midtown location meant that many of the places of interest are within walking distance. Penn Station is just across the street so access to the subway very convenient as well. This is also great if arriving by Amtrak as we did. Check in was very busy and we had to wait until almost 5pm until our room was ready. Our room was a small suite with two beds, two bathrooms and a living area with a sofa bed which worked well for our family of four. With the sofa bed extended though there was very little room in this area. A coffee machine was provided on request at no charge.  This hotel charges a compulsory resort fee of $29 plus tax per night regardless of whether you use the ""services"" it covers. Whilst this was highlighted on our hotels.com booking it could mislead you into";4
I booked this hotel at the last minute and as it was only a short break this seemed ideal.  Check in was quick and helpful.  Hotel is like Art Deco style.  Staff are really friendly. Lifts are quick Great location We had two double rooms which were ok in size. Beds are comfortable Clean rooms Rooms aren't very soundproof The only way I can describe this hotel is ' it's like a piece of antique furniture, it's not sparkly and perfect, it has chips and dents in it but that just adds to the charm'  I have stayed in a lot of lovely hotels.  And they seem a lot nicer but this hotel has a lot more to offer than them. Don't expect perfection but it has definitely made up for it in other ways. Cons: Needs a mirror in the room for ladies  dressing or a shelf in bathroom to put things on.;4
The New Yorker is a beautiful hotel. All the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The location of this hotel is perfect, within walking distance of Times Square, Empire State Building and many more attractions.  Close to a bus stop and subway stop.;4
The hotel has a great location, very easy to access the subway lines, to walk to Broadway and Time Square, very near the Empire State. It's a big hotel, with a very good service, the lobby is beautiful and the staff is very gentle. Lovely hotel!;4
The staff are friendly and helpful. The location is fantastic! An easy and safe walk to the theatre, shopping, restaurants, and the iconic Empire State Building. The security is excellent. Be sure to read the fun fact in the lower level small museum of famous guests of yesteryear.;4
Returning from Europe I needed Hotel close to Penn Station- this seemed to be ideal - I prepaid in full - however on check I had to pay an additional $23 for a faculties fee - mandatory whether you use or not!  The customer service was poor and I was placed in a room on the 22nd floor in a corner - not an ideal location for a single traveling alone!;2
Small room, beautifully furnished with loads of electrical outlets and desk space. Room had only 1 robe and 1 set of towels. The bathroom had a narrow shelf that was too narrow for women items. There was no refrig , or any ice maker on the floor nor was there a map to locate the nearest floor where an ice maker was. Security was top notch.  No one could get in this hotel without a security guard checking. NY is crazy and this location in right near train station.;4
"Stayed here when the Fairfield Inn & Suites around the corner was full and preferred it!  Hotel room seemed quieter despite being very busy in the lobby and we were upgraded to an amazing view of the city.  The only I didn't like was the broken/harsh shower head in the shower; everything else was terrific!";5
Visiting New York for the week by myself, I needed a hotel which was centrally located within walking distance of many places of interest and on the subway.  This fitted the bill.  My 23rd floor room had a view westwards to the Hudson River.  It was smaller than I expected, but had everything I needed. The bathroom was a little dated, but the shower worked well. I did not eat at the hotel which did have 2 restaurants - but there are so many other places to choose from!  The A/C was efficient.;4
A reasonably priced hotel for New York, for sure. In a great location for a fun, touristy trip. Walk to the theaters, sights, shopping, Time Square...it's on the metro, close to the river, tons of restaurants.  The hotel is vintage. The rooms are small, no surprise.  A little noisy but to be expected for the era. Nice front desk, good security!  There's a person checking room keys by the elevators.  Definitely stay again.;5
Excellent location! Next to Penn Station, walking distance to Port Authority and 42nd Street. Across the street from 5 major subway lines to take you anywhere you need to go! Historic hotel - museum in lower lobby pretty cool. Hotel staff were very nice.  It is definitely a high volume hotel so lots of foot traffic. My only complaint, which I cannot place on the hotel is the smell of the carpeting. At least on my floor and my room. This is totally UNDERSTANDABLE due to volume of guests and the dirtiness of New York streets. The hotel was very responsive and offered to change my room, I declined as more of a hassle to switch. I would recommend, and stay here again. Note daily facilities fee of $29+ tax,resort fee.;4
"Came here for my girlfriends 21st. Requested a bottle of champagne for the room on arrival and we're told we could have the bottle on the house, this we were delighted about and appreciated the generosity very much! Our iron did not work and requested a new one, 40 minutes later we still did not have one so had to go to our restaurant reservation with an un-ironed shirt. Other than that, still had a nice stay, would recommend the diner ""tick tock"" attatched to the hotel for breakfast and lunch and were surprised with a view of Empire State Building which made for great viewing when jet lag hits at 5AM!";4
As you walk in the foyer is nice and gives a false impression of the rooms.   We booked a suite as there were five of us and it was nothing like the photos. It was very much in need of a renovation.   To make matters worse they were building on the balcony and that would have made it a lot better. The door to the bathroom wasn't working but someone came and fixed it for us.   There was a bedroom with two doubles and a small lounge with a pull out sofa which had a very thin mattress on it.   The wardrobe was tiny for five people and there weren't enough hangers.   It was quite clean but there were lots of signs if wear on the walls and carpet. It wasn't quite what we had expected and as I said nothing like the photos.   The positives however are the location. It is practical;3
I went here back when it was called Wyndham Hotel, and I understand things have continued in good form since the changed name. The rooms were impeccable and the service was flawless. I would advise anyone to stay here. It's not cheap but well worth the price, unlike some hotels in the area. (Traveled before Sept 2016);5
This is the second time we've stayed at the New Yorker. The location is convenient to Penn Station and the subway.  The rooms are clean and we love that some rooms have two bathrooms and we've been lucky to get them.  The staff is great. As Wyndham Rewards members, I enjoy that we can bypass the normal checkin line. Mohammed was great in getting us checked in and the room we wanted.  We had to stop by later and he remembered us and was able to quickly help resolve my key issues.;5
Stayed here for 4 nights in August 2017 as part of our honeymoon. The hotel is a real haven in the middle of crazy town New York. The presentation of the lobby etc is immaculate and the staff are smart and polite. Our check in was swift and we were even upgraded rooms as a result of us being on honeymoon. The location is central - close to the subway, Penn Station, The Empire State Building, Macy's, Madison Square Garden, Times Square etc. We ate in the Tick Tock cafe which is open 24/7 and had a nice enough meal. Overall I would recommend this hotel on the basis of its great location, amenities and the friendliness of the staff.;5
The location is good - not far from Times Square.  However we queued to check in and were then 'greeted' by a very abrupt receptionist. They were busy but still no need for such a 'lack of welcome' We went to our room - much of the hotel has been refurbished apparently - not our room, it was shabby and very small. The bathroom tiny - we stored toiletries on the floor!  On day 2 of a 3 night stay our Tv broke down , the coffee machine didn't work and our room key was blocked. We were eventually moved to a different room, which was apparently an executive room it was much better had been refurbished but not much bigger!  We have stayed in New York previously and don't expect large rooms but...  We wouldn't stay there again.;2
Stayed for two shows at Madison Square Garden. It is right across the street so it was very convenient. The twenty four hour diner and late night pizza slices across the street came in very handy for post show munchies. We were running late due to Friday traffic, so we opted for valet parking, which while convenient was a bit steep at $70 per night. If your not in a rush you can save $20+ per night self parking within a few blocks. Our room was dated, the hotel could use a facelift, but everything was clean and the city view room from the 37th and 40th floors was outstanding. The dated look is part of the Art Deco charm. The bed was stiff and a basic spring bed, so if you need a softer or pillow top bed you might not want to stay here. We found it just comfortable enough. The;4
"On arrival at this hotel the only word that describes the lobby is ""Hectic"", there are people everywhere, hardly anywhere to move to and luggage everywhere. There are quite a few staff at the desk and they work through the queue quickly. This is a very old hotel building the the deco style but unfortunately the rooms are very small with very small bathrooms. The beds are comfy and the tv has a good selection of channels. The bathrooms could really do with an update and the one problem with the showers is that the temperature changes on its own and is not regulated well and the water switches to boiling hot which scolds you. The location of this hotel is good with Maddison Square Gardens behind the hotel.";3
Room was excellent! Location was perfect! We had a great view of the Empire State Building. Loved the hotel & would definitely stay there again.Staff was friendly and professional. Diner had great food located in the hotel.;5
Hotel is in a perfect location just around the corner from madison sq gardens and 10 min walk from towns square. Room are clean but in need of modernising. Staff are always friendly. Rooms can be quite noisy but I have always found this in whatever hotel I stay in in NYC. Good wifi. Beds are comfy.;3
We stayed here for 5 nights has a nice atmosphere friendly staff , rooms were very clean clean towels every day comfortable beds ,it has a bar restaurant and diner ok prices, the hotel itself is central would recommend it;4
My wife and I stayed here in June 2017. On arrival we were met by pleasant and friendly reception staff.  Our room was small, but we were aware that space can be a premium in New York.  We did have a few issues, albeit they were resolved by a friendly, and compassionate management team.  Because of the issues we had, we were given another room. A much larger room with a good view. So we were very satisfied.  The Hotel prides itself on its Art Deco style, and there are many details that show this.  The Tic Tic diner which is attached to the hotel was not for us, as we thought the service was not as responsive as we would have liked, or the food to our satisfaction. There are lots of other food establishments in the area.  There is a good sized lounge area with free wi-fi. There;3
We were given an upgrade when arriving without asking. That was really nice, after a 16 hours flight. It was a nice, spacious and just renewed room. But, the shower was dirty. We asked for it to be cleaned but they rather changed us to another room. That one was very small and with a run down bathroom. Elevator service was too slow. They gave us one free breakfast though.;4
We had the best room ever--the view of the Empire State Building was unobstructed and beautiful.  The room was small, but it was always clean (and we were kinda messy, sad to say).  My husband takes medication that needs to be kept refrigerated, so we had to ask for a refrigerator to be delivered to our room--and it was.  We were there for a convention, and, although some women had issues with their rooms, we did not, so I can only share about the excellent stuff we experienced. It is conveniently located to Times Square, Penn Station, Macy's, etc--if people are able to walk any short distances, it's really great. I would stay there again, in a heartbeat, if I ever decided to return to NYC.;5
Attended a convention.  Quaint hotel... typical NYC rooms... small and even smaller bathroom but it worked!  Having a stall shower was a plus.  Lots or road noise but it's NYC.  Staff was wonderful and could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Would stay here again.  Great location.;4
"So much to love!   The location is obviously excellent, with great proximity to lots of public transportation. My room turned out to be RIGHT next door to the ""Muhammad Ali"" room, which was a total (wonderful) surprise. The room was surprisingly big for a typical NYC hotel of this age, but that might be because I got a corner room which had two fabulous windows.   The bathroom was a bit rustic, but functional. And it was nice to have the Tick-Tock diner RIGHT next door, very conveniently located. Staff was friendly and helpful as well. I would definitely stay here again.";4
The service at The New Yorker Wyndham Hotel is superb!! It's nice that the front desk staff know me and make me feel so welcome! You can't go wrong with the location and friendly staff who want to make sure you have a great stay.. Especially Kader Saracoglu , the Guest Manager, who helped me to get the room on 4th of July week end ,  after Expedia messed up my reservation and spending hours on the phone with them. Great Job Kader.;5
We arrived at the Hotel after a long flight from the UK There was a long queue waiting to been seen. It went down fast the lady at the desk was very nice and asked if we wanted a room with a view or a bigger room we have but no view. We went for the bigger room. We made our way up to our room. Did not get any help with our luggage cannot remember what floor we were on but it was very high up. We found our room at last  We were told we could have a big room when we got in the room was dull one very small window looking out at a wall. Yes we were told large room no view but this room was tiny dark old fashioned the bathroom was not good dripping tap all night was not like a hotel bathroom cold did not look like it had been looked after old fashioned shower  not toilet paper. In;3
Like most properties in NYC the rooms are small.  We were fortunate enough to get a corner room which had 2 large windows.    Pros:  Major chain backed, clean rooms and corridors, subway near by, near MSG, walking distance to Times Square and friendly staff.  Cons:  Small room, check-in was a process, did not get my loyalty points.;3
The best part of this hotel is the location . Other than that, it's worse than a Motel 6. Not clean at all. If you're looking for comfort and nice amenities, this is NOT the hotel for you. However, if you want to be in walking distance if shopping, food and Times Square, you maybe willing to look over a less than comfortable hotel stay. Not my cup of tea, will never stay again.;1
It was a nice stay but there is some wait on the lifts. The staff seem very friendly , especially on arrival. The diner has very nice food and you do feel secure with all the security around . The upstairs corridors seem old fashioned and could really need a makeover Don't use the tour bus machine in the lobby. It doesn't sell tickets which  I found out when I arrived at the bus and was told I had to go the bus depot which was a queue for an hour;3
Stayed here for a week long convention.  Our room 2944, was clean, but very out dated!  The bathroom was tiny, and they really should replace the tubs!  Put in bigger shower instead.  Tub is ancient and was very hard to get into and out, as I have back issues.  A walking in shower would of been nicer.  Tub was from the 1950's I think, really old!  Floor tile was not clean. Basically, they need to redo their bathrooms.  Bed was firm.  O.K. to sleep, but what they call and queen seems more like a full size.  Safe in closet.  If you want to make your own coffee/tea, ask at desk for a Keurig to be brought to your room.  No refrigerator. At least in my room.  Elevators are very confusing.  One set goes as high as 20th floor, other goes 20 to top. In conference area the rest room are;3
Perfect location! The New Yorker is right in the heart of the city, one block walk from Penn St Station and across the street from CVS and Walgreens, and a Starbucks around the corner.  From the moment we stepped in the front door the service was amazing.  Check in was quick and we were assisted to our room with our luggage.  The room was spotlessly clean, fresh and comfortable. We had a wonderful view of the Empire State Building from our window. For the price we paid we definitely did get value for money and the little Italian restaurant downstairs was perfect. A wide choice of dishes with a variety of flavours, the food was cooked to perfection and the service was 5 star! We only had 3 nights here but it was one of the highlights of our trip to the U.S. Would return in a;5
Very good location. One block from Penn Station and two drug stores (duane read/walgreens and CVS) , Starbucks around the corner, Close to Empire State. Close to Mid-Town. You can get to many places for a $10 cab ride. The hotel staff was very nice and polite, professional.   I had a room with some plumbing and air condition problems. Told the front desk and immediately they gave me another room and offered to move my luggage. The new room was very nice and clean. The room was small, but efficient.  This is not a hotel if you plan to camp out in the room. The restaurant has good food and friendly service. If you plan to stay there in the near future, try the William Hill chardonnay. Bottomline, I would stay there again.  I have traveled all over the world and United States for;5
My daughters treated me with a beautiful room at the New Yorker for my 70th birthday. We had a suite that worked great for the five of us. My two teen aged granddaughters joined us and they were happy with all of the amenities! Really great to have a 24 hour restaurant in the building and we certainly took advantage of that. The service at both the hotel and the restaurant were outstanding.;5
"To begin, the location is pretty good because of the proximity to the Empire State Building and Penn Station (lots of subways go by this place). However, staying next to the busiest corner of the city makes it impossible to open the window at any time because of the noise and the lights. If you're looking for some quiet time when back home at night, you might like to find a place above the 59th St. or south (Soho, West Village, Tribeca, Brooklyn). I'm generally not very sensitive to noise of any kind, yet I haven't experienced something that much overwhelming so far. You have to know that 34th St. (where the hotel sits) is one of the busiest street in the whole city, day and night. Moreover, I don't think it would be appropriate to call it ""cleaning"" but hey, that's what it's";2
The hotel was throwback to the 1920's and was very appealing. The room was quiet, had a great view and was very comfortable. It was well decorated and perfect for a single business traveller. Centrally located to Madison Square Gardens and an easy walk to many attractions.;5
The location is great.  We traveled by NJ-Transit to Penn Station.   The hotel is less than a block away.   Easy access to subway.   Easy walking distance to Times Square.   We had a suite for a family of 4, including 2 kids over 15 - it was a nice room with a great view of the Empire State building.  The staff was friendly, and everything was in good working order.    We ate several times at the connected Tick Tock diner - where the service and food were great.   I'd definitely stay here again.;5
I love the Wyndham New Yorker!  It's a great location whenever I'm going to MSG. My only complaint is that there aren't mini fridges in the rooms.;4
This hotel is way past its prime time and judging by our room it is in urgent need of refurbishment. Perhaps other floors are better? There was absolutely no room to move around, bathrooms need updating, toiletries...better bring your own. Lifts don't work well, takes forever to get into one.   Having said that, we had a great view (upgraded view room), staff were helpful, wifi worked pretty well, it's decent value and the location is very central.   For breakfast try 'Best Beigels and Coffee' on 36th Street. One of NY best beigel shops.;3
This is a brilliant hotel in a great location it's close to time square, the Empire State Building and Penn Station which is great if you are coming by train just a short walk away.   The hotel is all Art Deco 1920's the lobby is amazing and the design continues up in the bedrooms even thou they are on the smaller size it's a central hotel in the heart of a busy city.;5
super tiny rooms, no space for bags. and bathroom is so old. shower is terrible, there is no normal running water, its a spurt of hot and a spurt of cold.;2
Great location, close to malls, dinning and other attractions, staff is Great, however Hotel is a bit outdate, problem with the hot water, light out, and other maintenance problem. Concierge staff could be a bit more helpful, there seen not to care mush about assisting guest.;3
This busy, Art-Deco-styled hotel is located across the street from Penn Station, making it perfect for train travelers.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and goes out of their way to resolve any problem that may arise quickly and without question.  The 24-hour diner attached to the hotel is a great convenience for guests who want a quick, satisfying meal, New York style - diners in the City are fast disappearing, so this is a glimpse of history as well.  The New Yorker never disappoints.;4
When we arrived at this hotel there had been an error in our booking and my Aunt (aged 75 and with health problems) and myself were booked into a room with only 1 Queen bed. The trip was to celebrate my 60th Birthday so this was a hugh dissapointment. Further complications were that there was a major event at Maddison Square Gardens which mean that the hotel was full. An irate call to the UK followed which proved to be fruitless and served to build a lengthy queue at the hotel reception.. I went back to reception and Mohammed had managed to find a bigger room which would enable a sofa bed to be put in the room and waived the additional cost. In addition we were given complimentary coffe and breakfast which helped ease the situation.   The hotel is idealy located, the staff are;4
The New Yorker was perfect for my trip in May! It was located close to Penn Station and by where my conference was being held, plus a Starbucks was across the street! Our check in process was easy and quick, the room was clean and had a great city view, the beds were comfortable, our luggage was stored after check out so we could enjoy the city, and we enjoyed a drink at the bar before heading home. Looking forward to returning!;5
We struck gold with our room - floor 19, room 36. The views of the Empire State Building were amazing and it's not far to walk there either! The bed mattresses were very comfortable and we didn't really suffer any street noise so slept really well. Can't fault this hotel as its very close to many of the New York sights. We'll definitely stay there again.;5
We resevered the suite on 38th floor, very nice two baths one bedroom but a sofa bed in living room. This gave my wife and I privacy in bedroom and a private bath while our granddaughter had her own bath. Gtreat view, clean room. The subway was close and Sal pizza was just a short walk they have been open since the 60s. It was a great location with close subway and time sq. I would highly recommend this suite if you want a privacy for two parties staying in same room. Very one at hotel was friendly and helpful. The tiC tock room had a very good breakfast.;5
Stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights before travelling onto Mexico. My travel agent booked this hotel and after reading some of the reviews I e mailed the hotel direct to upgrade our room to a superior with Empire State View.  I was e mailed back immediately , I also contacted the hotel for airport transfers , spoke to John who was amazing and couldn't be more helpful.  The service before even arriving at  the hotel was excellent.  transport to and from hotel was excellent too.  Our room 3022 was everything I asked for, an amazing view of the Empire State Building and as we were there for the 4th July fireworks we watched them from our room.  Would return in a heart beat;5
The staff was extremely helpful when we asked how to find our way around Manhattan.  I was impressed with the concierge service.  They seemed to know the neighborhood (we needed a flower shop).   The room was small but clean. I think ours had been recently updated.  Great location, close to theatre district and transportation (right next to Penn Station). From our point of view, it was a great location.  The only downside was the room size, but that was a minor issue.;4
We picked this hotel for its location to Penn Station but it was also within walking distance of Times Square, the convention center, the theater district as well as the Empire State Building. The staff were very helpful and made our stay very enjoyable (from the front desk, doorman and housekeeping). It was a great price for the location. Nice amenities and an interesting little display downstairs about the history of the hotel. Will stay here again.;5
Visited this hotel at Christmas and it is ideally situated for all that New York has to offer.  The first double room we were given was tiny...so tiny that it was uncomfortable for 2 people to move around.  We spoke to the great staff at reception who moved us to a larger room....much better!;3
A hotel build in 1929, entirely kept in the '30 ies athmosphere but up to date in service an technology. Nicolai Tesla used to reside here until the end of his life and found a little museumspot in the ba&sement of the lobby. The hotel has an impressing hall and elevator for levels 1 - 20 and 20 - 40. At our last stay (we stayed here already once - 8yrs ago) we had a room on the 40th floor with a perfect view on the NY skyline and Empire State building. We love the atmosphere and the friendly staff. renewal of rooms is in progress, but did not reach the 40th floor yet. Nevertheless the room was always clean and comfortable. The hotel doesn't offer a breakfast service, but just next door there is a great diner you just can walk into from the lobby.;4
Always enjoy staying here since the location is so great. Room renovations were great. Rooms still a tad small but that is NYC for you. The only complaint I have were the gnats in my bathroom.;4
The location does this hotel wonders.  I've been to NYC many times and I absolutely love this city.  I chose this hotel because of its location.  It is close to pretty much everything!  The room was clean and noisy of course, but that's NYC.  The front desk was friendly, but this is the first hotel I've ever been in where they have a security check to make sure you have a key card for a room.  The hotel is always busy, and it is great for a short stay.  Would definitely come back!;4
I have stayed in a lot of hotels in NYC for work and leisure, and this is hands down the best hotel in the price range. The staff were all really friendly and accommodating. The hotel is older, but it has a cool, art deco vibe to it. The rooms are immaculately clean, which honestly, in new york, is rare. (dont get me started with the horror story of a bed i got at the W times square a few years ago...). The beds are really comfortable, there is ample storage. We were in town for the Phish shows at MSG, there were tons of phans partying and having a good time but you couldn't hear anything room to room, great insulation. oh and the air conditioning is amazing - rare in NYC. Yes the rooms are smaller, but if you have ever been to NYC you know that is the case everywhere. these;5
The location was perfect to walk everywhere we wanted to go.  The room exceeded our expectations: Premium Queen suite actually had a King Bed, two bathrooms and a very large balcony where we spent every evening watching the city lights.  View included both the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building.;5
The decor style is very impressive to me and the location is convenient to shopping nearby.  Its conference rooms are very accommodating and suitable for meetings.  Overall its a good place to be and I will eventually visit again.;4
Great location. Easy to walk to bars/resturants. Empire State Building 5 minute walk.  Room slightly dated. Had to request tea and coffee. $13 service charge a night - no option to opt out. All staff friendly.;4
The Art Deco design of this hotel is beautiful, really feels like you're entering the 30s when going into this hotel. The staff i encountered were all pleasant and chatty, the rooms were spacious and clean. I got an amazing view from a corner suite so I could see the Empire State Building from my room window and Madison square garden. The tick tock diner that is connected to the hotel is also great for breakfast as they do really good pancakes and omelettes from my experience and the staff there were also friendly.  You get free drinks like coke and water stocked in your fridge every day which I was impressed with. My only complaint with this hotel is the wifi, it was very bad, very slow and stopped working for no reason which was very annoying because it was next to impossible;4
The area is very busy and with that comes noise...inside the hotel the staff are varied...some dont speak even when addressed...others are ok. The lobby is nice but its like stepping into a wind tunnel with various doors open Hotel was built in 1929 the exterior is lovely the rooms need attention..walls are paper thin and you can hear conversations and bathroom usage from adjoining rooms  If you want to be in the thick of things this is the place for you;2
Beautiful art deco hotel built in 1930s slap bang in the centre of Manhattan. Stayed on the 34th floor which has good views albeit the rooms are a bit small but its New York city so space is a premium here at $1000000 per square foot in some areas so not a bad deal at $230 a night! Rooms are in need of renovation, staff are friendly and the tick tock diner is a great place to eat and watch the madness of a city that really doesn't sleep.;3
Good hotel on 34th street, I liked the entrance, art deco style, There are two restaurants onsite. Its in a great location really convenient for subway and Penn street station.  its a hotel I have always wanted to stay in at seeing in in films and on tv etc. Check-in and check out can be busy at busy times.;5
All in all the place is nice and we'll located. However the room was really small, which wouldn't have been a huge problem if we could open the closet properly. This wasn't possible because the door hit the bed and therefore we couldn't open it more than 1/3. Uncomfortable.  Other than that the bed was excellent.  We liked the hotel and its history and finally it doesn't deserve all the bad comments I read. But they really got to fix this closet issue!;3
the art deco lobby is beautiful and the location is very good- near MSG, Penn Station and  a short walk to Times Square where I had business meetings.  The rooms are small, the bathroom door doesn't even open all the way or it would hit the toilet. But the bed is great, the dresser/desk is nice and the closet is small but functional. FREE in-room wifi was nice. a lot of business hotels annoyingly nickel and dime you for this.  Not a place I'd stay for a week-long trip, but for a short business trip it was great.;4
Basically our travel agent sold us this hotel as one of the most exclusive hotels in NY. The lobby looks awesome but then you get into the reception desk and you find quite rude employes. We were lucky to beeing treating with Jessica, she told all everything was paid for and that a deposit of $45 per night will be kept for security reasons. We agreed as that is standart. We got into the room after beeing waiting for an elevator for 5 minutes and the room was small but we thought it was clean.  On our 3rd day here the hot water stoped working so we phoned to let reception know. I phoned 2 times and they said a person was coming to check what was going on. I am still waiting for that person to come.  We pointed out that the bath was dirty and we had breakfast vouchers and a;1
A central NY hotel with a story, right by Macy's and easy to get everywhere ! Quite roomy by NY standards, great staff, a good gym and 24 hour deli 😀the staff are very security conscious which is reassuring too;4
"Stopped here a few weeks ago. The 1st room we were given smelt really strong of cigarettes, was not clean and was very small and dingy (I'm not a big fattie by the way, nether is my other half). Asked for a change of room, which I was given but not much better. At least it didn't smell and was slightly larger. Still wasn't very clean, the sheets were grey through age and bobbley. Only 2 of the 5 lifts to the upper floors were working, so long wait for lifts. Also long wait to check in, about 20mins in a queue. Staff only interested if they can ""up sell"", as soon as they realise they are not going to get you to book a broadway show with them and earn some commission from you they or quite rude and don't want to help! I would never stay here again. I have travelled a lot and this";1
Arrived late evening at the Wyndham and check in staff were very polite. Smooth process and straight up to the 22nd floor to our room. More than acceptable room for our trip...decent beds, clean, nice bathroom...lovely art-deco lobbies and fixtures...gives you a very romantic feel to the stay. During our stay there were problems at times with the lifts but the staff were very helpful and directed us to the service elevators as an alternative. The view from our room, 2237, was limited but let's be honest, when you go to Manhattan, how much time do you WANT to spend in your room admiring a view when you should be out there experiencing it?!  Location......couldn't be better as a base for Manhattan. Directly opposite Penn Station and within easy walking distance of all of midtown;5
"Its been a few years since Ive stayed at the New Yorker.  However when I was traveling to New York yearly!   The New Yorker was the place to be.  Located by everything Gardens, Time square, javits center, shopping.  it a great ground zero for any trip.  I've gotten ""under construction"" rooms for as little as $89 but on average I remember $189+.";4
Room 3630 looks out onto view of Hudson River.  Small room with no fridge or coffee making facilities, however they did supply complimentary when I mentioned it on reception.  But sure to ask when you arrive as they certainly didn't give anything away upon check in. They also said we had been upgraded but not sure from what and to where as this room was very basic....but clean and comfortable.  Friendly staff too, would definitely return.;4
This room is so small that my son and I can not walk past each other without bumping into one another.  We were on a cruise a month ago and it's hard to believe but that room was larger than this shoebox.  Unfortunately we have 2 more nights here.  The common areas are sweltering hot.  Especially the elevators.  Elevators are not easy to get and when you do get one you will be smushed up against 20 other sweaty bodies.  Also, whatever you pay for this room when you book, forget it, you will be hit with a facilities fee of up to $35 a night.  Which is an absolute ripoff as we haven't been able to access wifi at all which is supposedly one of the items covered under this fee.  Avoid this hotel.  It's a joke.;1
"Brilliant base from which to explore Manhattan.  Close to subway stations and in easy walking distance of e.g. Empire State Building.  Good part of town. Never felt unsafe at any hour.   Good tip for breakfast. Turn left out of hotel door and walk a few hundred yards to ""Essen"".   Just one thing: the lifts! You really can wait ages for a lift. If you're in walking distance by stairs of Floor 20, go there. Every lift stops at 20.";5
Recently took the family to New York and stayed at the New Yorker which is a wonderful old Art Deco style hotel. The position was sensational right in the heart of mid town close to the Empire State building, Times Square, Madison Square Gardens and the giant Maceys store. Was a bit disappointed with the internal condition of the hotel as its very tired but that didn't particularly worry us as we were out day and night looking around. Very nice diner attached to the hotel and staff were fantastic! Overall would give it 5 stars for location, 5 stars for staff and 3 stars for room condition!;3
I arrived in NYC, with my 10 year old daughter at the end of a week long vacation in DC, at 9:45am. After a short walk to the hotel, which seemed to be quite a bit longer carrying 2 bags and pulling one, we arrived at The New Yorker. We get in line to check-in (which I can't do until 4, I really just wanted to drop my bags and hit the city) and this lady approached my daughter and myself and told us she could help us and pointed to a desk with 2 chairs next to the big check in desk. We take a relieved seat, which is apparent to Reachell who is helping us. She asks for my name and pulls up my reservation, while this is all happening she has asked about what bought us to the city and I explain that this is my daughter's first trip to NYC. She welcomes us and then proceeded to find;5
We stayed here for five nights in room 4003 which is a one bedroom queen suite on the top (40th) floor. We chose the Wyndham as it was cheaper than some other options  Pros: - great location couple of blocks from the Empire State and Times Square and in walking distance of Central Park and the restaurants on 9th Avenue. - great view of downtown and the Freedom Tower (from our room). - great adjoining diner (Tick Tock) which is open 24 hours and provides does room service.  Cons: - Slowest lifts/elevators in the world! - Limited hotel staff on hand - don't expect anyone to help to get your bags from the kerb to your room. - Rooms are quite old (but functional). - Limited in room facilities - no kettle and just a random coffee machine which we didn't use!  Would stay again...;3
The New Yorker is in a good location for subway or other transportation. The staff were outstandingly friendly and helpful. Good security at the elevators (you can't go in without a room key). The value was great. Also the Tick Tock Diner attached to the hotel has amazingly delicious food. I recommend the grilled salmon dinner. Highly recommended for families or groups!;5
There is no coffee in the room, elevators are limited, almost always full, and had to squeeze in Everytime I had to go down or up. Ice machine is not on every floor, and going up or down in elevator is a nightmare;2
excellent location and easy to locate for turists. Nice rooms and good service. The cafe-restaurants connected serves good breakfast. Good hotel for the pricing. Not so much tax for Cleaning as some others.;4
We absolutely loved staying in this hotel when we spent a week in New York last year. The hotel was situated opposite Maddison Square Garden and was a short walk to Times Square, I think we timed it as 8 minutes. We felt that staying here gave us a lot of choice. We had plenty of things planned but we could be quite flexible and add in things or go back to the hotel quickly to change after a day of exploring.  Our bed was just lush and after a day of taking  it all in I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. I loved the style of the bathroom and the shower had fantastic pressure.  Tip- the elevators are super busy at peak times so you can either have to wait a long time to get down to the ground floor or up to your room. Give yourself plenty of time if you have a reservation or a;5
"The New Yorker is a spectacular hotel in NYC! As a Wyndham Platinum member I was upgraded to an amazing suite at a very fair rate! Rachell and Onelia took wonderful care of us and we even got to check in early! The room was very large considering we are in Manhattan. The suite had a separate living area with a mini bar; it was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Breathtaking view of the Hudson from our room! Thanks again! We will be staying again soon!";5
I was scratching myself almost from the beginning of our holiday In Wyndham Hotel. I thought that it maybe was a mosquito bite, But then at the last day when I was packing my things I found a lice crawling into my luggage. I told the hotel about my experience, cuz I now knew why I had been scrathing all my holiday staying there. They told me that They would Get someone to look at it and then e-mail me, But I haven't heard from Them! See the pics In the comments.;1
The New Yorker is a historic hotel with an Art Deco theme. Upon entering the lobby area, you are transported back in time.  Unfortunately, the rooms are dark and in desperate need of renovation especially the bathroom.;4
"The hotel is in a great location; opposite Madison Square Garden with Times Sq, Broadway, the Empire State and other key tourist locations nearby.  Pretty much all of the tour buses pass outside the hotel so you are never too far from an awesome site.    On a practical level, the subway is across the street & there is a huge post office down the road which I found useful for a last minute delivery.  Also - for movie fans, there is an iMAX cinema on the very next block which is a must if you need to catch the latest flick (Spider-Man Homecoming  The staff were extremely courteous and special mention to the lovely Linda on the front desk who took care of me as a solo traveller.  She went out of her way to give me tips and was always available with a smile if I had further";5
Booked a last minute three night break. I have stayed at this hotel many years ago before it was a Wyndham. It is much much better now. Fantastic Art Deco hotel, we were upgraded to a room with a view, looking north could make out Times Square. Rooms are small as are most New York hotel rooms. Stayed on 37th floor serviced by many lifts (elevators), even there are six service lifts if you go into the stair well which are far less busy and therefore faster! Room was spotlessly clean with very high quality linen. If you ask at reception for coffee making facilities, one is delivered with stocks of coffee and even English tea, to the room. Staff in the lobby check each person is a hotel guest before allowing them into the lift which adds security. Checkin was fast and efficient as;5
"Great location and pet friendly. The hotel is huge so wait times for check in and out can be slow. The reception staff are not extremely welcoming or helpful, but I can imagine with so many people coming through each day, they don't have much down time. I would definitely recommend staying here if you're looking for somewhere central and close to the subway. The room was small but who needs more in NYC?! The shower was amazing. Noise carries from the corridor, but not a problem after being tired from sightseeing all day. We got a ""good"" deal (plus resort fee and pet fee) from a third party website. I will definitely stay here again if the price stays so reasonable.";5
Great location. Friendly welcome. The room on the 23rd floor offers a fantastic view. Price performance was top! Hotel is a bit old. We would book again. From the Penn-Station directly at the hotel you can see everything in Manhattan.;4
The hotel was very nice. The room was very well cleaned and had no details of the previous guest. The bathroom was a bit from the 80s, but it served its function. The shower could be improved with a stronger water outlet (idk how it is called the thing where the water comes from). The staff was also very nice and willing to help you if you needed something. There is a breakfast bar in the 20th floor, but you can't go in there, that was a big bummer, because the only thing I wanted was to look at that view.;4
My most recent stay was from June 28-July 6, and I had a great experience, with only a few minor hiccups. (more on those later) When I arrived at the hotel, it was still early in the morning, too early to get my room just yet- the room they had set aside for me was apparently still occupied. They took my credit card info, the bellhops checked my bags for me, and I was told to come back between 3 and 4 pm. One thing that really impressed me was that several staff members recognized me when I walked into the lobby and came up to the front desk, even before I took my ID out. I know I'm a repeat visitor, but I only come once a year, and they must see countless people every day.  I had booked a view room and requested a higher floor- I was not disappointed! When it was ready later;5
Hotel is in a great location. Across the road from Penn Street station and Maddison Square Garden. 15 blocks up and one street across your in the middle of Times Square. Rooms are very small but your only there to sleep, so OK. The lifts are the biggest problem there, seems there are only 2 working out of a possible 6 or 7 if your up on the right hand side of the hotel as you approach the lifts, so you end up waiting quite a long time for the lifts. Apart from that, the Hotel is fine for a four or five night stay as we did.;4
We stayed at the historic New Yorker for a couple of days for Independence Day. This was a good value in a central location. We had two rooms, with one in a renovated section. Both were typically Manhattan style small but very comfortable. Small local food finds were great, as was the convenient 24-hour on property Tick Tock restaurant.  Everyone on staff at the hotel was exceedingly pleasant and helpful. Mohammed of Customer Service and the Front Desk was particularly charming and knowledgeable. It was evident that he took great professional pride in the hotel. He not only anticipated our needs but surprisingly remembered us even with all the holiday guests. His warm welcomes differentiated this hotel with style! We plan to come back!;4
Central down town hotel. Comfortable , decent sized room (informed of an upgrade when checking in) but bathroom outdated. Recommended if all you need is a bed for the night.  Adequate breakfast in adjoining diner.;3
Built in 1929, this great hotel is a grand feature to behold.  We arrived early and after an hour wait, the front desk clerk obtained a room for us to check in.  If we elect to leave our bags at the bell hop, we would have to had paid $3 per bag.  Our room, room 2807 was extremely small as I am sure most room are.  I think in the Wyndham's remodel stage, they should have knocked a few walls down and join them to make suites if they had not dome that.  The cleaning staff were very pleasant and eager to assist for whatever needs you may have.  The lobby seemed to be very busy all through the day and night.  The lobby security worked diligently as to not allow unregistered guests to have access to the elevators and that is appreciated.  I liked this hotel a lot and look forward to;4
I stayed at the New Yorker for four days when I visited Manhattan with my mom. It's located about a ten minute walk from both Times Square and the Empire State Building, so I'd say the location is good, but other than that, this hotel is just that: a hotel. The staff is average (the concierge was nice, but the lady who checked us in was quite rude), the rooms are small (normal for New York though) and the wifi was awful (you had to sign back in all the time). Overall, the hotel gave the impression that it was once a luxurious building, yet is now just old and kind of mouldy (showers!!!!!!!!!!!!). I'd still recommend it though because it is inexpensive and New York is a place where you spend most of your time sightseeing, and not in your hotel.;3
Of cause it is understandable that hotels in capitals or cultural centers of the world are tremendously expensive and thus when we look for accommodation we try to fit price, location and quality in some reasonable margin. This is exactly what I did sometime back when I first time traveled to USA. I picked New Yorker first for its location - which is convenient but for active travellers, who can walk through NY city center in 6 hours as I did, the location wasn’t that drastically important after all. The price,  I remember, was average, buy when I arrived they took quite big deposit and almost the same amount at the cost of my 7 days stay. This didn’t help me in budgeting my stay for next week, thanks god I did have some funds additionally to not starve there to death. It was;2
"Jessica at concierge saw we would be here a week and gave us a room with a small view on a higher floor, it was very appreciated.  The gentlemen in the lobby who made sure only guests had access to the elevators were pleasant and made us feel secure.  The beds in our room were comfortable.  Our bathroom was spotless even if the fixtures were retro and seemed incredibly dated with antique looking knobs.  Both Penn Station for the train, and the subway were in the same block.  Macy's, Bryant Park, Times Square, Rockefeller center were all an easy walk.    We were on the 36th floor, loved the ""street noises"" when we opened the windows just a few inches.  Could see the Hudson River and Madison Square Garden.  It was a great place to stay.";4
The location of this hotel is perfect just off time square.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The lobby and reception is very pretty unfortunately the rooms need updating. The bathrooms are tired too and no water pressure. We had a triple room but it was more like a twin room not big enough at all. As we weren't in the room much this did not spoil the holiday.;4
The New Yorker Hotel is an old hotel that has been renovated.  The is nicely appointed. The rooms are very small, there is very little closet space, no amenities.  The bathrooms are very small, and there is no shelf space,  no coffee makers in rooms.  The Tick Tock Restaurant, attached to the hotel,  has a good menu and the prices are right.   It is very popular   The hotel is in the heart of downtown Manhattan,.  Penn Station and a  Subway are a block away.  It is within walking distance of 5th Ave., the theater district and much much more.;3
We were given a complimentary upgrade on arrival and the room was huge.2 double beds and loads of space.Fantastic view of Empire State,didn't get disturbed by any street noise.Bathroom was large and a very powerful shower Free calls back to UK(when I say free did have to pay $29 a night resort fee). Room was very quiet with no noise from any other guests,only complaint was I had to ring every day for tea/coffee pods as these were never replenished in the more.I did mention it to the maid one day and she said it wasn't her it was housekeeping???? Will continue to recommend this hotel and stop again. We were in room 3617;4
Great location - if you land at Newark, you can catch a train to Penn Station, which is very close to the hotel.  The location was great - ten mins walk from Times Square, close to subway. The lobby is lovely, but the rooms are a bit tired as are the landings. Bring your own conditioner as that provided is in tiny bottles and not up to the job! The staff were all lovely! We had a couple of breakfasts in Tick Tock, the onsite diner, which was ok but there are better places elsewhere to have breakfast. We had dinner twice in the Onsite Italian restaurant which was fab - huge salads and excellent staff. Lobby staff very diligent in checking everyone had room key before accessing lifts, which made us feel safe. In short, not luxurious but a safe, clean hotel in a great location.;4
Pros: Great location - close to Penn Station - walkable to Times Square. Clean rooms but they could use some updating. Wi-Fi worked perfectly. Rooms were sound proofed.  Cons: 3 out of 5 elevators were out of service...so long waits. bathrooms were ancient. No coffee machines in the room. (Starbucks across the street) They charge a 'resort fee' upon check out...;3
This hotel clearly tries to capitalise on the fact that it is a historic hotel. It suffers however from apparent feature.  We stayed in the Queen Room and was supposedly upgraded. This was misleading because nothing appeared to be different from the original room we had booked with the exception that it was on a higher floor.   The room was bland. The room looks rundown: cracked bathroom tiles, decrepit curtains, antic-looking furniture. Decor was nothing special. The shower head was abysmal and was weak. You could barely feel that you were showering. The elevators took a substantial amount of time to arrive and they clearly have an overcrowding problem in their foyer.  Also there is no self-service laundry option which is surprising given the large amount of space they have for;3
We booked this 4 star hotel for our trip. The rooms are lovely , ask for a higher floor.The hotel is a 15 Mins walk from the Empire State and Macy's. We have a great view on the 37th floor. Rooms are quite big but dated.  The bathrooms are SO tiny and the shower makes an awful noise ! Today we are celebrating a birthday and rang down to the front desk to request some cutlery and plates to enable us to eat the birthday cake. I was horrified to be told , no we have none of these items and go and buy them for yourselves from the shop opposite ! I thought you really are joking aren't you , no they replied !!!!! I rang the Tick Tock diner inside the hotel and they also refused to loan us any plates etc.... I'm so angry right now and will be taking this up at Check Out.  The safe in;3
Great spot! Right next to Penn Station, madison Square Gardens and a few blocks from the Empire State Building. Lovely old hotel. A little tired in places, lifts a little slow if above the 20th floor! But worth the wait for the views! We had a view of Empire State Building from our room! Awesome!!! Staff all lovely! Air con great! 24 hour diner in hotel & plenty 24 hour eateries around. Highly recommend it;5
rooms looked much better in photos. In actually they are old, poorly lit and dirty.  We found hair in the bath tub, a clogged sink, a lumpy bed upon our arrival. The front desk service is a hit or miss. Housekeeping is lazy.  The bathrooms are old with chipping and stained bath tubs (i've never experienced this before). Shower pressure is great but the shower curtain can't handle it.  The hotel is miserly about lighting in the rooms and it's all white dim lighting at night.  They were also terrible about honoring a complimentary breakfast included with our stay add per our booking confirmation - even though we had it IN written. Considering it was a long stay, we therefore spent a lot on breakfasts out.  Lastly the hotel does not have any  plates and provide only plastic glasses;1
Art Deco style building - rooms are small but ok - entre like in the 50s - bathroom small and old - bed are a bit slept over - tic tic bar ok for a quick bite - staff friendly - close to the Empire State Building and Times Square;3
So gross. We stayed here 6-28-17 to 7-2-17. I got back to the room on Friday July 1st and before I got in bed I decided to flip my pillows and I found a bed bug!!! It was almost midnight and it took 40 minutes to get someone to come up to get our stuff and into a new room. Never staying here again.;1
Very nice hotel would stay here again Had 24 hour dinner in lobby. Clean and safe. Had lots of elevator security liked that. And was walking distance to lots of things. Great value for the money. The only compliant was the hotel website shows pictures of the rooms and they look big and found out there all not that size are room was small compared to the photo. but was still a great room.;5
As a,family of 4 we booked the New Yorker for 7 nights. On arrival we found the room to be very cramped but accepted this as New York city standards. We booked via Expedia. They asked for a review and my husband submitted that the staff were fantastic, hotel public areas amazing but the room was very small for a family of 4 for 7 nights. Next thing we knew the manager, Kader, was looking for us. She upgraded us to a suite with late check out on our last day free of charge. Amazingly well handled and most unexpected. Kader had a,warm friendly, sunny personality and made our holiday experience more special.;4
This is a historical hotel and you can tell , lobby was beautiful, staff were awesome and very polite, elevators ran very slow leaving you waiting for a ride, or deciding to take the service elevators instead because they were faster, room was small but if your in your room too long in NYC go home, bathroom needed updating big time but the pillows and bed were comfortable we slept like babies ! The tick tock diner connected to hotel was delicious! This hotel is very centrally located to everything and worth it.;3
Stayed a couple of nights here to catch some Broadway theatre shows and this location you really can't beat.  It is close to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station so getting here is very easy. Great views from the rooms as well.  Front Desk staff very friendly we asked Linda at the front desk a few questions about the area and she was very helpful and responsive to all our needs at check in.  I would recommend this hotel for all types of visits business or leisure.;5
Fabulous hotel and staff great location the view from our room was amazing 46th floor facing the Empire State Building.  The check in staff were very helpful couldn't do more for you.  Has a diner attached went for breakfast great staff and food love the pancakes. Location is great Subway just over the road makes it easy getting down town can't wait to come back to NYC will be staying here again 😀😀😀;5
The New Yorker is a great location - walking distance to Times Square and the theatre district.  It has an excellent lobby for meeting business associates or friends.  The rooms, though small, are very clean and comfortable.  The staff is friendly and helpful!  It has a good business center opened 24 hours and a very good fitness room.  I always choose to stay at this hotel when I travel to NY on business.;5
Staff were courteous and polite. Building is slightly tired (understandable given its history) but rooms are modern and comfortable. Fantastic location, walking distance to times square, Central Park etc. And also right next to Macy's for the shoppers! Very close to two subway stops as well. We didn't try the restaurant but we once we tried the diner we kept going back, everything on the menu smelled/looked/tasted delicious. The blueberry pancakes were out of this world! Perfect for when you're too tired to find somewhere for dinner or lunch or you want a nice breakfast! For the price we paid it would be the first hotel I look at booking when I return to New York!!!;5
hotel is facing madison square garden and only a few minutes walk to Times square and empire state building in either direction.  our room was indeed in an old part of the hotel and resembled what it is ....a hotel with heritage.I  loved seeing the old pictures of the hotel hanging in the lower lobby. even though the corridors and doors looked akin to 1950's the furnishings are the opposite. such beautiful comfortable beds and amazing power in the shower. seriously refreshing after a day in new york city. staff were all very pleasant and helpful. the location of the diner attached to hotel was brilliant great for the big breakfast! again staff here were great. also the coffee dock in the lobby is very handy for anyone who wants a lighter breakfast. would recommend this hotel and;4
"Super hotel!  Super location!   One block from Pennsylvania (Amtrak) station.  Staff is always super kind and courteous to myself and my family.  I would not stay anywhere else in New York.  Rooms are clean, restaurants are great and serve really good food, breakfast, lunch, or dinner.. To me, the Wyndham New Yorker is beyond and FIVE Star hotel; to me it is a TEN STAR HOTEL!!!";5
"I booked this hotel for my parents last year, as part of a much longer cruise trip to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary. To keep costs manageable we picked reasonable hotels in New York and Niagara Falls, but this turned out the be their highlight of the whole trip! They were given a great room; clean, bright, quiet and stunning views. Staff treated them like royalty. I can't thank them enough! If I had any negative feedback it would be that the area could be a bit intimidating at night, but security did a great job of making you feel safe.";5
The hotel is right in the heart of NY with easy walking distance to all attractions and land marks.  No coffee facilities unless you pay for the upgrade. No fridge in the room.  The staff are super friendly and very helpful.;3
I had stayed at this hotel the first time I visited New York and the location, proximity to the subway and comfortable rooms brought us back again.  The hotel itself if beautiful, art deco and like many of the buildings in New York looks like something straight out of a movie! The rooms are small and basic but that is all we needed during our stay as we were out exploring the city from the crack of dawn until the wee small hours every day. The staff that we dealt with were really friendly and the attached tick tock diner served us the best breakfast we had during or entire stay.   Don't expect the lavishness of the plaza but if you are looking for a comfortable place to crash after a long day of sightseeing close to all the big attractions and with great links to everywhere in;4
My partner and I stayed at the New Yorker for three nights in late June. The location of the hotel is very convenient for Penn Station and Midtown, and easy access to the rest of Manhattan as a result. The hotel building is an art deco wonder, and the hotel exterior and lobby are very evocative of that era. We had a great view of midtown from our room on the 27th floor. However, the room itself was in poor condition. On entering, the room reeked of stale cigarette smoke and as we pulled back the curtains there was a lot of dust. The room decor and bathroom fittings were very dated and the air conditioning was noisy.  As other reviewers have said, there was often a long wait for the elevators.  My main gripe with this hotel is the excessive 'resort' fees. $29 per night (plus;2
Two nights in this superior property was just superb. I was lucky enough to get a good view across the city to the Hudson River and loved seeing sunset and the city lights. Very special for a repeat visitor this great city! The room was tidy, clean and nicely appointed. I would suggest there's a need for somewhat better configuration of the bathroom shelf - it's a thin piece of glass and really doesn't hold much. This is a minor complaint. The Tick Tock diner downstairs offers hearty American style food, and the foyer of the hotel is Art Deco grand. I checked out the interesting display of photos and memorabilia in the downstairs area - more could be made of this area, as it seems a bit tucked away. Celebrate your fine history! I really enjoyed my stay again.;5
I stayed here first 20 years ago.  Location is great, a fine example of an art deco building in the city that does them best.  A stones throw from Madison square gardens and Penn station you are in the heart of midtown on the westside.  Lobby is busy, lovely examples of brass plaques, antiquated lifts and a huge art deco chandelier, however the lobby is the best thing about the hotel.  Your on 8th avenue, and I was on 29th floor and could hear the traffic and emergency vehicle sirens throughout the night, which tells me the windows are old and not very good at insulating.  The rooms do not seen to have changed in 20 years, dirty tiles in the cramped bathroom which remind you of your grandparents bathrooms back in the 1980's, rooms just as dated, no fridge or tea or coffee making;3
Spent a night here before our flight back to the UK. Very convenient location on 8th Avenue for Penn Station and the fast Airtrack train to Newark Airport. The hotel has a great diner next to the main lobby, excellent menu and service. Also, near lots of restaurants and shops, Madison Square Garden and Macy's is next block over on 7th Avenue. The hotel's rooms are quite small but clean and in a lovely Art Deco style. The staff were great, very helpful and the security team keep an eye on comings and goings in the lobby. If you turn right and walk up 8th Avenue you come to Chelsea village, lots of small bars and shops. Would recommend for a family stay or short visit to NY.;4
Recently stayed here June 30 thru July 3, 2017.  Room on the 36th Floor a view of Madison Square Garden &  Empire State. Tick Tock Res is good. Shuttle to the hotel runs $23-$28. I recommend this hotel.;5
Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location.  I couldn't recommend this hotel enough, it has everything you need, if I was to be really picky and fussy I would say the rooms are quite small but still fab! The bar connected to it is amazing also, the cocktails are so delicious!! Can't wait to go back :);5
Stayed at  the NewYorker Hotel Wyndham, it got so many clients however i would like to register my disappointment with the room service, it was skipped twice and also done very late, comes with a polite notice that bedsheets will be changed every after 3 days or after checking out...........not my kind of Hotel hygiene, finally the Queen bed was not Queen compared to other Hotels, but the stuff are friendly.;3
Arrived here quite late as we had travelled from Niagara Falls on the Maple Leaf train and didn't get into Penn Station until just before 10pm.  The hotel was only about a 5 minute walk away.  Check in was quick and we were in our room in no time.  Room was quite small but perfectly adequate.  There was a safe in the wardrobe. Bathroom quite small and shower was a bit erratic, boiling hot one minute and then cold. There were two restaurants downstairs, one I think was an Italian and it also had a bar where you could have a few drinks without having to eat and the Tick Tock Diner which served food 24hrs. The bed was really comfortable.  Whenever you came into the hotel to go upstairs, security always checked your room card to ensure no-one who shouldn't be there was, and that;4
The location was perfect for our Manhattan stay.  The E line subway was located just across the street from the hotel.  We mainly traveled on the E line to all of our destinations including the 9/11, China Town, the High Line, Greenwich Village and to see jazz on 50th street.  We encountered unnecessary problems at check in since the reservation was in my wife's name and she was not present.;4
I attended the Summer Fancy Food Fair at Jacob Javits, the NYH is so close and it was very pleasantly for rest. The NYH is at 34th Subway Station and it is easy to go anywhere. I will Checkin in my next trip to NY.;5
Parking was worth it, Staff from valet parking though check out were courteous and helpful. I enjoyed the art deco style. I thought the bathroom had charm. And the view was the Empire building! It was close to the theater. I did not get a chance to check out the gym, and the only disappointment was no pool;4
We were on the 34th floor with a fantastic view over the Hudson. The room looked lovely and clean when we walked in.  The 2 large beds, were comfortable clean and we had a great sleep.   The only problem we had to report was that the bathroom sink blocked and we had to ask for tea making facilities. They were both sorted out within an hour, very efficient.  It does get very busy at the elevators and sometimes there is a bit of a wait, but that is understandable. On the last night they broke down and we had to use the service elevators, but that was fine as they were faster.  The $25 resort tax was a bit extreme as there was nothing to justify it. If there was a pool or a spa will I might have used it, but a small room with a few computers is a bit much to call a business centre;5
The front desk staff were outstanding.  I selected this hotel as we were arriving by a late train, and the hotel was close to Penn Station.  The rooms were tiny, but the prices were reasonable for New York.  The front desk staff were warm, welcoming, and friendly - after midnight.  The rooms are small, but definitely adequate.  The bathroom had a small patch that was either mold or green paint that had been inadequately painted over with white paint.  Otherwise, it was a good experience made unforgettable by the outstanding staff.;3
The staff was very nice , the front desk agents were nice enough to help us find a good place to eat . The rooms are small but thats because the hotel is very small. I love it overall. I am planing to come back;5
i'm from Canada,and this is very good and welcoming hotel. everything is so beatufull,my room was just an amazing, lots of speace very clean.  looking forward to stay here on my next trip to New York. thanks;5
"While the photos look great the rooms do not live up to the hype and are outdated. True it is in a good place not far from Times Square but this hotel and others have started to charge for anything they can get away with. Most hotels offer free wi-fi but this hotel not only charges for it the problems I had connecting to the internet in the room were frequent. There is a good security in place but I would recommend another hotel that doesnt feel the need to charge you for things that should be included in the room price. There is a ""resort fee"" per night of $10 then tax on top, they will argue you can use the gym/wi-fi and their business centre which is a small room with 3 computers.";3
Stayed here with family for 3 nights, location is great. We got train from Newark Airport to Penn station, it cost $13 each and it is only a 6 minute walk to hotel. Empire State Building is about 5 min walk away & Times Square is 15 mins away. Check in was real slow as there was some issue with our room but guy at reception was apologetic. When we got keys to our room & went up to it there was someone else's belongings in there!! After a return to reception again this problem was immediately resolved.. the guy Mohammad on reception was efficient & professional. There was 3 of us staying in room, it had 2 double beds, was clean & although a bit on the small side it was not too cramped. Bathroom is small but really quaint, decorated Art Deco style...we loved it! Our room had a;4
We stayed here on the 38th Floor in a suite which had a 6ft bed and a sofa bed in a living area. It was very comfortable. The room had a seating area with a tv, coffee maker, desk, fridge and sink. It also had a large chest of drawers and a built in wardrobe, which was ample size to keep 2 large suitcases in. The main bedroom had a chest of drawers and the same size of built in wardrobe with a safe inside.  The bathroom was more than adequate with a shower over a full sized bath.  The room was well maintained, very clean and kept very clean during our stay as we're all the other areas we saw. Tolietries were nice and well replenished when needed.We had no problems hearing anyone else at all, no noise from any other room or from the corridors, in fact we had a very quiet stay as;5
Very old but updated hotel in the heart of Manhattan, a couple blocks from Time Square, right in the action. Great location, okay front staff, clean, safe, rms are small but it is Manhattan and the hotel is historical. Bead was comfortable, AC works fantastically. Attached to the hotel is a great bar and the Tic - Tock diner which is fine for lunch and breakfast. WiFi was included BTW. Would I go back, yes, absolutely, and I've stayed in NY before at other hotels. Entire hotel is Non Smoking which IMO is fantastic. You wont be disappointed. Enjoy.;4
My husband and I stayed at the New Yorker for 6 nights and apart from the initial (it lasted about 60 seconds-I shut it down pretty quickly) sales pitch to buy a time share it was the perfect fit for us.  The staff were attentive, helpful and polite.  Rooms were clean and a decent size.  We had an incredible view from the 37th floor.  The hotel has two restaraunts:  a diner and also a little Itallian restaraunts.  This hotel is within reasonable walking distance from Time Square and the Empire State Building.  Other attractions (Statue of Liberty ferry, Wall Street and Central Park are a bit farther but we walked everywhere.  The fitness center is decent with some, weights (both machines and free weights and of course cardio equipment.  We would definitely stay here again.;4
Not for business people. The elevators are a nightmare, the rooms are old and not well insulated so there is a lot of noise from all around. There was a smell around I didn't like at all. I couldn't relax for a minute. The location is its only advantage.;2
Just recently stayed here and there's not much to fault, it is very central! You've got Maddison square garden just across the road, Times Square about 10min walk, Empire State Building about 10-15min walk!  There are plenty of shops, Starbucks, McDonald's a pharmacy just outside the hotel which is very handy. Rooms are a bit small but I think they have character, comfy beds, TVs, iron, desk, shower and bath (although the shower is not great! Not much power to it). The room itself is very clean which is my number one on the list so I was quite happy. They have a shop on the ground floor so if you need snacks etc it's just there. The hotel staff are very friendly and accommodating, quick check in and also there is a member of staff before entering the lifts to check your key card;4
This iconic art-deco style 60's hotel is located in central Manhattan next to Pen station and is ideally placed for exploring by foot and by transport.  We were upgraded to a larger landscape view room on the 27th floor.  We were only staying for 3 nights so we were not to fussed but it was a novelty treat to look out across the NY skyline during the brief awake time spent in the room. There is a safe in the room, no charge.  The room was clean and tidy and room service was efficient.  The bathroom fittings were old but all functioned satisfactorily and served their purpose well.  The entrance hall of the hotel reflects the 60's heyday of that era.  The lifts could be busy at peak times but no unbearable delays.  Refreshments on site are provided by the Tick Tock Diner, which we;5
This hotel impresses when you step inside , it's a bit of glamour from the past. Check in was welcoming and efficient , all the staff were professional and polite. Our room was fine, spacious enough and clean, would have been nice to have coffee making facilities in the room as we were there for a few days. Some of the decor in the hallways on the way to the room need refurbishment , it looks dated and tired. The wifi is excellent a big plus when travelling with teenagers and is free, wish more hotels could achieve this . The hotel is located close to everything you need in Manhattan, we like to walk so this was a real plus. Will defiantly visit again when in New York.;4
The New Yorker is a very nice hotel that is centrally located.  The rooms were nice and clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  We stayed in the King Suite which was perfect for my family of four.  We had to switch hotels after our first night there because our first hotel was horrible (Hotel Pennsylvania).  The reservation staff was very helpful (at 2 am I might add) in helping us to get last minute reservations and a room with a discount.  The front desk staff were extremely friendly and efficient.  No lines at the front desk.;4
We enjoyed our 5 night stay at the New Yorker. Check in was prompt, the room was a good size for the 2 of us and we loved the Art Deco features of the hotel. Ate breakfast at the Tick Tock next door. Location on 8th and W34th street, midtown and close to the subway was perfect for experiencing all that New York has to offer.;5
"First i'll give you the negatives to get that out of the way... On arrival at check-in the receptionist said to me in her response, ""yes Mr Dowling, we have your room ready for you.  I have also left the suprise flowers and bottle of wine as you asked""....my girlfriend was right next to me so there went that surprise.  To top it all off they had not sorted my daughters/boyfriend room out yet so their welcoming surprise arrived, after they did...... Not a huge thing in the bigger picture but was quite personal to me so in all honesty New Yorker, you did pee me off....and almost cos this review....  However (now the positives 'cos i'm a noice guy) from this point I can't think of a single complaint between 4 of us.  Two rooms very close to each other (initially requested), roomy";4
Very great hotel, nice rooms and comfy beds. The hotel was located nicely almost next to the entrance of penn station. It was a bit a pity that the hotel rooms very very small, so if you are planning on staying with 4 people in a double queen room, I wouldn't do it and grab two rooms.;5
"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel and would stay here again. It was in a great location, in walking distance to time square. The diner next door was great. Our room was clean and had a great view. We stayed in a ""suite"" which very comfortably fit the 4 of us. The staff was attentive and very nice. They made our stay comfortable and provided us with attraction suggestions in the city. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC.";4
Excellent service very clean quiet hotel with newly renovated room.  Good security for this historic hotel that was developed by Mr. Tesla who was ahead of his time.  Also has a good size fitness center;5
Our room had ample space we were 3 people sharing,we booked a suite.The location was perfect walking distance to TIMES SQUARE and MACY'S.Their in house restaurants are well priced we ate and drank there on 2 of our nights stay.The staff are very friendly.;5
My daughters and I stayed two nights in The New Yorker in early June 2017.   It was a last minute booking due to a change in our schedule.  Given the price and location I figured I'd give it a go and I'm glad I did.   I won't belabor you with a long Conde Nast Traveller style blog here and will focus on what I figure matters to most travelers.  Check-In/Check-Out: Quick and painless.   The grandly restored lobby kept my daughters attention while I went through the front desk two step.  Desk staff were friendly, polite and well dressed.   Check-out was even easier.   Dropped the key cards in the drop box and headed out.  Rooms: We stayed on the 34th floor and had a great view of the city including a fine view of the Empire State Building.  The room was clean with comfy beds and;4
The New Yorker is the best place anyone visiting N.Y. can wish for. It is located in the heartof everything. Penn Station is one block away. Madison Square Garden is about a 5 minute walk away. A few blocks away is the Empire State Building. While at the hotel I caught the subway which is 2 or 3 blocks away. No more than 30 minutes by subway is the ferry for the Statue of Liberty, MoMA, the NY Museum of Natural History and of course  Central Park. The Hotel itself is incredible. The metro view is breath taking. The restaurant in the hotel is great as well. The coffee shop on the lobby is comparable to, if not better than Starbucks. The staff, from the service desk, to the conssierge, the attendants to the maids, are awsome. They all know the best places to eat, what subway to;5
Hotel ok, but this is what you expect in New York.  Areas of the hotel need updating and decorating.  Room was clean and quite spacious for New York Hotels.  Breakfast in the hotel Diner and Restaurant good.;3
Location: great location, right at Penn Station which was great as we got Long Island train from airport! Loads of places to eat near by and close to most sightseeing bus routes.   Cleanliness: I felt hotel was spotless, lifts, hallways, corridors and room were clean and maid service every day.   Hotel: hotel clean and well kept, has a bar and restaurant - was only here 3 days so never used any of the facilities. Only fault was there was no information booklet in room so had to google check out times etc.   Staff: staff all attentive... I would like to take this time to mention one in particular... after a long LONG day of travelling (Glasgow to Edinburgh... Edinburgh to london... london to NYC...) my 10 year old daughter was really struggling as we had been up for almost 20;4
Surprised my daughter with a trip to New York staying at the New Yorker. Fabulous hotel with really friendly and welcoming staff special thanks to Mohammed for checking us in and arranging the room with  the awesome view of the Empire State Building. This hotel is central for everything and everywhere is walkable. Transport links are great - quick trains to and from JFK and Newark stop at Penn Station which is across the road from the hotel. We will be back;5
Not the cheapest but in a top location for a visit to NY . Clean with friendly cooperative staff . Room was a bit on the small side but , hey , we were there to be out enjoying ourselves not moping about in a hotel room .Tick Tock diner  is good for breakfast .;5
My fav hotel in NYC especially for events at MSG. Will make reservations again soon! No negatives at all, Welcoming lobby, excellent staff, awesome location. We make our  go to hotel anytime staying in NYC;5
I enjoyed a 3 night stay here using it a as a base to explore Manhattan for 3 days  before attending a work conference on long island.  My impression of check in and the lobby were very good. Staff were friendly, no issue with check in formalities and the lobby etc is very grand.  The room was a queen size double and perfectly adequate. It was clean and everything in it's place. No particular view from my window but this did not bother me. Only issue I had was with the safe as I could not get it working. I called reception and they sent someone up promptly to take a look. I had noticed some reviews saying that the rooms were noisy  (noise transfer through walls etc.) I experienced no issue with this. The room next door I think was bigger than mine and had a family with young;4
This was our first visit to NY, and for location in our opinion we could not have picked a better hotel.  We had looked at the previous reviews and frankly where a little nervous of what to expect. On arrival the lobby looked clean with great décor, and our booking in was friendly and efficient.  Our room was very small and had no view at all, however it was in line with previous comments and what we expected. It had a comfortable clean bed and was suitable for our needs as a base, but the bathroom was in desperate  need of a revamp and re decoration. Peeling paint job, old soap residues left on the side of the bath, rough and extremely worn bath bottom, which was uncomfortable under foot.  Had it not been for the location then I think we would feel really let down.   The staff;3
Rooms are the size  of a shoebox no safety box no mini bar. The bathtub and bathroom walls had hair stuck in them, I complained but still were left there after they did the room. Every employee except for the security people I dealt with were unfriendly. Walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors.  Also I must have called the operator on 5 different occasions,  and there was no answer.  I asked for directions at the  information desk and was treated pretty rudely. Checkout was unfriendly also. The hotel was not cheap  , I was expecting at least a 2 star place. Wyndham seriously needs to review  this property  and better train employees.;2
Walking into the lobby it looks great. Very modern looking and we were helped immediately. The front desk clerk asked what our visit was for and once she found out it was my husband's birthday and his first time in New York she offered us a bottle of complimentary Champagne in our room even though my husband doesn't drink I figured it would at least be great for me. Once we got on the elevator and made it to our room we could tell the hotel had some remodeling and upgrading to do. The room was extremely small from any hotel I have ever been in and there was no refrigerator. The view wasn't the greatest either. I immediately called the lobby to see if there was an upgrade room or at least one with a refrigerator. She told me that they would possibly have a slightly bigger room;4
Although the room was excruciatingly small and we had no view, the bed and pillows were quite comfortable. The walls were a little flimsy because we could hear rooms around us taking showers and flushing. The location is ideal, nearly on top of the subway. There are short walks to get to any of the subways.  There are many food options close by, and the bell man was nice enough to stand in the rain and hail us a cab. Madison Square Garden is down the block, while Times Square and Bryant Park are also within walking distance. We were impressed that no one to get up to the rooms without showing their room keys to security.;4
This hotel was beautiful in it's character.  We loved the art deco!  We also LOVED the location.  Being centrally located was great for sightseeing.  The subway stop was right across the street and no metro ride was more that 6 stops (30ish minutes) in either the north or south directions.  We were also within walking distance of the Empire State Building!  It is an old hotel and there are some quirky things about it, like outlets are not always next to the bed, so maybe if they put lamps, etc that had outlets built into them, it would be helpful for all of todays technologies. OVERALL - a beautiful and well located hotel that we would definitely stay at again.  Be sure to go downstairs and see the history exhibit of the building!!!;5
While the employees were good to deal with the overall experince was not a good one.  Upon arrival of my room it seemed as if i was placed in the smallest room that was soaking up all the noise in the area.  Not to mention the rooms around me.  The bathroom was very small, no space to spin around in there. After sitting in the room for about 20 minutes with all the noise I went to the front desk and expressed my dissatisfaction.  The manager on duty was able to change the room to one that seemed to be recently upgraded, although you could see that it was just a minor face lift to the room I had before. The money paid for the room wasn't worth it at all not even half the amount would have been worth it.;2
We spent four nights here kicking off our two week east coast vaca. The first night we were in a very small room but the front desk moved us (without asking) to a much bigger room with The Empire State Building right out our window! The location was perfect for our subway adventures. We are very pleased with our stay.;5
Great location, good room. Very helpful and friendly staff.  Secure. No one admitted to elevators without your room key, and that's good.  If there were coffee pots in the rooms, that would be nice.  Or at least complimentary coffee in the lobby, but instead, there's a fairly pricey coffee bar in the lobby.;4
Very convenient located but the space is small.  Do not let the pictures fool you.  With that said, we hardly spent any time in the room except to shower and to sleep so it was okay.  Do note that there are student residents on several floors of the hotel, so you are likely to run into skimpy dressed individuals who drown themselves in cologne and perfume in the evening.  Our room only had one set of towels, and to get another set took over an hour.  Overall, very clean, the AC functioned well.  It is across the street from Madison Square Garden.  Valet Parking will cost you $60/day.  They charge you a service fee which gives you free wifi.  You cannot opt out of it and it is $29/day!;3
Excellent location - very close to Macy's and Fashion Ave - close to Penn Station for Trains, Subway and believe it or not a full service Tim Horton's!! Rooms and property were very clean, secure and comfortable.  Enjoyed being able to walk to dinner every evening and also enjoyed the Bell/ Security Staff who are great ambassadors to the New Yorker hotel and to the City of New York.;4
I won't recommend the New Yorker, mainly due to the horrible, no good, very bad attitude of the people working in the reception area, beside other stuff. Here's my list of grievances:  1- Noise levels: the noise from the street is not blocked by the windows. Horns, police, ambulances and fire engines can be heard at the 28th floor at the same level as if you were on the street. The windows are not sound proof at all. 2- The building is old. But there are charming old and just old. The rooms at the New Yorker are the second type. Awkward floor plans, subcompact bathrooms and a strange closet are the norm. If someone is using the bathroom in the room besides yours, you can hear the pipes making strange and ghastly sound on your room. 3- The people at the reception: this is the;2
"The location is a half block away from Penn Station and next to the subway stop.  Convenient to walk to a lot of places to eat.  We had two rooms, one on an ""executive"" floor, was nice but not noteworthy. The other room was also just ""OK"".  Both were smallish and the absolute absence of anyplace to be able to set things out in the bathroom was very frustrating. The security check by the elevators was reassuring and hardly ever having to wait for an elevator was nice.";4
This hotel has an excellent location to visit all major attractions in Manhattan on foot. There is a train and subway service next to it and it is the most convenient spot to do a lot of sightseeing.  I would have preferred a room with a view but we were allocated an inside room looking onto machinery.  The check-in is very slow so would recommend to allow plenty of time for it.;4
I stayed at this hotel for a conference. The conference services were quite good in terms of food service. Their A/V people needed a bit more coffee at times to keep up. But the coffee was good so that shouldn't have been a problem. The lobby presents a vision of a grand, luxurious hotel. Then you get to the rooms. Ok, I get it, it's Manhattan, I don't expect a villa. But it took some adjusting to the small size. The bathroom in particular is tiny. But what redeems it all is the location, close to tons of stuff and sitting right on top of a subway station so you can get to anywhere else. Maybe not the best value for your money, but worth at least checking it out.;4
This was my fifth stay in this hotel. I choose it because of its location within the heart of Manhattan and also the friendliness of the staff. We were a family of 5 and we stayed in a New Yorker Suite double. It was a spacious room with lots of wardrobe space. We had a view of the Empire State Building which was just fabulous! We asked reception for a coffee machine which was delivered swiftly and the coffee pods were refilled every day. There was also a fridge in the room as well as two TV's, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. There were two double beds in the bedroom and one sofa bed in the living room. It was perfect for us. The hotel has a security guard at the elevators checking to see if everyone had a room key, which is good. There is also a diner attached to;4
Stayed here many years ago, but much has changed particularly in the lobby which looks much better.   On check-in we were invited to a desk where Miguel efficiently allocated a room which was upgraded because we were Wyndham Reward members. It was a bigger room than we had originally booked and had a splendid view of the Empire State.   The room had obviously been refurbished, although the bathroom hadn't, with its original taps and bath. Still perfectly usable though.   Only slightly annoying thing was a couple of occasions when we had been out all day in mid-90s temperatures only to return to find the air conditioner had been turned off. Soon cooled down though. And the wifi had to be logged into afresh every day.   Then there was the notorious facility fee, not mentioned at;4
Stayed for three nights at the Wyndham New Yorker, 481 8th Ave., New York. Booked on Expedia. When we arrived at the hotel we each where charged a Facility Fee of $29.00 plus tax of $2.57 per day. I asked what this was for and mentioned I was not notified of this additional fee when booking. The staff informed me that it covered use of Internet, Gym, and any phone calls made. I explained we will not need use of the Internet, Gym, or phone calls in the room. However this didn't matter and the fee was mandatory. I checked on line to see if the fee was noted when I booked and they did not note fee anywhere.   Also, this hotel is not a 4 star hotel. The rooms are small, staff not very polite, food is served from a cheap diner style restaurant, and the whole hotel has a dark, brown,;1
This hotel looks like it has not been painted, remodeled or updated since 1960 or earlier. Aside from the fact the rooms are tiny and expensive the rooms are so outdated in every way. The bathrooms, furnishings, paint and everything else are so old and cramped. There are much nicer hotels for the same price in the same vicinity.  I do not recommend this hotel. I am surprised Wyndham puts its name on this property.;2
Stayed for 3 nights over a weekend. The rooms were a bit small. Mohammed on the check in desk was excellent & helped out with all our questions & made a big difference to our hotel experience. Good location for those who want to get about both ends of manhatten.;4
The hotel is right in the heart of NYC.  Its rather large, but the rooms are never loud.  it took a bit for our room to be ready but they held our luggage.  The room (two doubles) was pretty sizable for a NY hotel room .  The bathroom was also pretty roomy.  Didn't spend a lot of time in the room.  Close to transportation.  Tick Tock Diner was good for breakfast.;3
Stayed here over the weekend. Check in we relatively quick, even though there was a queue. When we got to the room it was looking a bit tired, could do with a bit of a make over. Couple of things that weren't quite up to scratch, towels were small, and toiletries (shampoo etc.) weren't replaced during our three night stay. Hotel has plenty of history, and it's well located, just not quite what we had expected;3
"Reception on arrival the first time for 2 nts was very disappointing. Arrived on QM2 for 2 nts before touring. The woman was rude, the girl checking in could not believe her attitude. Room was rather jaded and as the building was old did not get a great room, pokey. On returning here after 2 weeks travelling and having 3 other very good hotels, again disappointed with receptions attitude and service. The girl spoke in Spanish to another girl back and for(I speak Spanish so understood) but that was rude waited whilst in the middle of checking me in she disappeared. The people in the next queue were checking in and gone who came after me. The room was even more pokey and the bath was disgraceful. Paint or enamel all chipped off. Had about 9"" to get through to the bathroom as a";3
Stayed for 4 nights. Reception was very friendly on check in. Explained additional charges but reduced them to $10per night. The wifi was excellent and very fast. Room on 26th floor. The room was lovely. Not large but functional. I have stayed in smaller rooms in other european cities such as london and paris. The bathroom was small but functional. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet. The location was excellent. Lots of shops etc nearby. Maceys is a 4 minute walk away. Empire state building is 10 minutes walk away. Right by penn station subway station. We had a problem with our room safe during our visit and the hotel sorted it quickly and efficiently. We had breakfast in the tick tock diner each morning. Food was good. There are lots of other establishments to;5
While the room was  somewhat in a hidden corridor, it was clean and comfortable.Staff was pleasant and made check in a breeze . I would recommend this centrally located hotel . 2 Restaurants at this hotel conveniently located in house;4
We booked our room online but they charged us extra 29$ per night. Our room was small and noisy. It was my first and last staying in that hotel . The location was good . Their price is not reasonable and I am not satisfied at all.;2
We checked into the New Yorker after a few nights at another very average hotel further uptown, The lovely lobby had a real buzz to it and several staff acknowledged us or spoke to us while we were waiting to check in. What a great location! We walked everywhere! The renovated room are elegant, however the bathroom was a bit small with nowhere to put your toiletries. not good when sharing with another woman. Our view of the Hudson was wonderful. We were advised of he $29 a day surcharge beforehand and thought it was a bit steep, however it did cover international calls so  I was able to telephone  Australia several times at no additional cost. There was also very good security in the lobby and helpful smiling service every day.;4
Having stayed in many hotels in NYC this was definitely not up to the scratch of the other ones!   Check in was quick and efficient. Staff were friendly on the desk and we got to our room via the old and creaky lifts! The room itself was tiny. I know this can normal in NYC but it was very very small. There was just enough room for a bed and a chest of drawers with a TV on the top. We did have a lovely view of the Empire State from our window but that was the only selling point.   The other disappointing factor was when we were checking out we got charged $2 per bag to leave them at the hotel in their secure room! In all the hotels we have stayed at we have never had to pay to leave luggage. As we had not been notified of this charge we only had $20 bills with us and the staff;2
After you've paid online the hotel adds a resort fee surchage - $29 a night extra.  You may see it in the fine print but this is an unethical and sneaky way to soak the customer.  I hope there is a class action on this business.  Definitely a very bsd deal for a place that is tattered and is most definitely NOT A RESORT.;2
This was our first time in New York and The New Yorker did not disappoint! We asked for a room with a view and they gave us a Fantastic view of The Empire State Building and MSG. The staff was very friendly and our room was always clean. We started our days by eating at The Tick Tock diner, good food, friendly staff, and quick service.  The location of the hotel is great! MSG/Penn Station is basically across the street, short walk to Times Square, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Centre, etc. We would definitely stay at The New Yorker again.;5
Nice design, pleasant staff, welcoming receptionist. Food was nice and the best thing is the restaurant was quiet. Rooms are OK. It has everything I need to have a comfortable stay. Decoration is interesting.;5
Old school NY, does feel a bit like you are in the 90s. The hotel could do with a refurb but for a few days, it was an excellent location to get wherever I needed to.  I got a room with a living space (sofas) and 2 showers and baths. So it was almost like an apartment.;3
I stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights with family we had a quick check in and were given a free upgrade we stayed on the 7th floor which has been recently refurbished, the room was spotlessly clean and cleaned each day of our stay, all staff were polite and very helpful I would definitely stay at this hotel again. There is a fee to pay that allows you to use the hotel facilities this includes wifi and the room telephone;5
"Stayed here for 6 nights recently. Hotels lovely and in a great location. Arrived and the woman on reception we dealt with was amazing! Gave us a bigger room and was so friendly (sorry I didn't catch her name). However, I can't say the same for other staff members, particularly security. We were having issues with the lock on our room and had to get keys changes a few times. It turned out it was the battery that needed changed however to have one of the staff on security constantly be rude and make remarks about how we ""must be doing it wrong"" was just rude! After a few hours we eventually did get it fixed. Other than this I would recommend the hotel but some staff members definitely need to take customer service more seriously.";4
Hotel has great art deco interior. Easy walk to Penn Central, subway and Madison Square Garden.Located in the hotel is the Tic Toc Diner open 24 hrs. Solid diner food and reasonable prices. All staff friendly and helpful. Basic room adequate, a bit small.;4
For the past three visits to Book Expo, this has been my hotel of choice and every experience has been excellent. Before I start on my wordy review, please keep in mind that this is a historic building fraught with the common layout of the times, which means there can be small rooms and tiny bathrooms along with the continual maintenance issues that must plague an old building.  I had originally reserved a room with two beds.  About a week before my reservation I received an email with suggested upgrades and chose a room with two bathrooms for an additional $20, which turned out to be a good decision.  Check in went smoothly with Muhammed giving us a beautiful large room with two bathrooms, but after spending a few minutes in the room realized there was some kind of;4
5th stay and just keeps getting better. Stayed with family for 4 nights in May. Fab room on 37th floor with views of ESB. Really special. Staff friendly and check in process quick and dealt with all of requests. Great location. Tick tock brilliant. Bathrooms could do with an update but will not stop  me from returning. Love this hotel. Will be back !;5
Just back from New York and spent 4 nights at this hotel. As it was our first time visiting we wanted something quite central which it was. It's a 30 min walk to Central Park and not far from Times Square and Macy's. So the points definitely go for location. The not so positive aspects of the hotel is the rooms. Walking into the hotel reception you get a positive feeling as it's nice but upstairs it's very disappointing. We were on the 21st floor with a view of the Empire State Building which was good. The room itself was tiny and had a tiny bathroom you could not display anything. The wardrobe was small and there was hardly any room to move about in and it was really dated and looked like it needed a good clean. I would say it was probably a 2 or  pushing it a 3 star at most.;2
One of the best hotels in New York City, it is located almost close to everything you need to see or visit. The staff are very friendly and great, and the rooms are very clean. If you need any kind of transportation you can just name it at the front door and you will have it. Highly recommended....;5
"I went to see Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden last week and we wanted the full experience. After seeing what was around, we found The New Yorker was not only on the opposite corner of The Garden, but also part of one of our hotel rewards programs.    The hotel is in a 40 story building that was built in 1931.  All the rooms have been completely refurbished but you still get a little of the nostalgia of the older hotels.  When we went, it was “Fleet Week” so the hotel was crawling with Navy and Marines ; some of whom were actually part of the concert with Billy Joel.   While the lobby was full of guests, visitors and other, check in was fairly easy.  The check-in /front desk associate’s name was Driss.  He found out we were part of the rewards program and upgraded our room to";5
I picked this hotel purely on location.. she is a grand old girl.. travelling with a party of 5 we grabbed a suite for the week.. we were a little disappointed only 1 bathroom but we managed.. the beds after travelling from Australia to New York were heaven in our 5 weeks stay in the States we often talked about those beds... location wise shopping everywhere just across the road is Madison square gardens buy the tickets for ice hockey you won't be disappointed.. time square & broadway a few blocks away. Tick tock restaurant adjoining the New Yorker is value for money meals especially for a big party..;5
The usual small room for an hotel in New York, ours had an inward facing view which was a bit dark and disappointing, but we didn't spend much time in the room. Shower was ok but lacking room facilities ie.  no fridge in room nor tea/coffee making facility. Bed was only a double not the King we expected. And we saw a cockroach in lobby while waiting for elevator!!!!;3
The location of this hotel made it easy to get around to many area attractions. You are close to Times Square, Theatre District, the Subway, Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden just to name a few. We even walked to Central Park although it took about 30 min. The hotel staff were all very nice.  The lobby was beautiful and having a restaurant and bar onsite is great.  We found the food was very good. The front desk even called us after we left our luggage to explore hours before our scheduled check in to let us know the room was ready early. We didn't even request that so a pleasant surprise.   On the opposite end of the spectrum, I paid for the metro view which was one tiny window partially blocked by a wall because we were on a corner.  What a waste. The room was small;3
We enjoyed our stay room was clean and staff accommodating. Stones throw from MSG as we were there to see Billy Joel. Would use again if in the neighborhood. They also allowed us late check out which was convenient.;4
Travel agent recommended. Great location close to Hell's kitchen for great food options. Room was tiny and needed updating. Peeling paint in bathroom, carpet frayed in hallway. Bed was very comfortable and it was immaculately clean, so those were saving graces.;3
"Chose this larger, older art deco-type hotel on Booking.com b/c of the price but didn't read the fine print regarding ""The Resort Fee"" which I believed was already included in the quoted price. They require you to pay it when checking in. The Resort Fee includes 1. free wi-fi (worked mostly well) 2. 24 hr gym (didn't use b/c we were out touring the city 80% of the time & who wants to come back exhausted, then go work out) and. 3. All local & long distance & international phone calls (only good if you have no cell phone or tablet) 4. Use of the business center (who charges to use the business center?) Anyway, this cost is $29 per day on top of the already steep NYC hotel & city taxes. It's next to Penn Station so it's convenient to take the shuttle (makes 2-3 stops) from LGA for";3
"We were extremely disappointed with the attitude of the receptionist on arrival at the New Yorker and, sadly, the experience didn't improve much after that. Our credit card was not so much requested as demanded and, when I queried the amount that would be held by the hotel, was simply told it was hotel policy in case I incurred extras while staying and anyway ""your company will be paying for it"". As it was, this was a personal holiday not charged to any company and apart from the internet charge of $10 there was nothing else to pay. A $49 charge was excessive, especially as it took more than a week to refund it. Once we got to the room there were no facilities for making a drink, simply the option to ask housekeeping to provide something but no explanation about whether that";2
We picked this property because it is so close to Penn Station.  And that is a nice advantage.  But it doesn't offset the fact that this is a very outdated property with teeny tiny rooms.  Our room literally felt like a closet.  We could barely get around each other in the space around the bed.  We were only in town for one night and were so busy all day that we barely had time to be in the room except for sleeping, so it turned out to be fine.  But if we were there for even one additional day, we would not have been able to take it.  And even for one night, we'd never book here again.  We'd rather have a short cab ride and stay in a nice place going forward.;2
I have stayed at this hotel over a hundred times in the the last 10 years.  I love this place! One  particular thing that makes the New Yorker a great place to stay is a gentleman named Mohamed who works at the front desk.  He always greets me by name and makes sure  I have a room with a great view whenever possible.  He is always courteous and efficient and in my view is a major asset to his employer.;5
We stayed at the New Yorker hotel for three nights last month. Our small room did not have a view but being away from the busy street meant it was quiet The bed was very comfortable but we were disappointed not to find coffee making facilities in our room. The lobby was  grand but elsewhere the decor was rather dated. There was a good security presence near the lifts. The reception staff were friendly and efficient. Our in room safe was not working when we arrived but was fixed within 10 minutes after a call to reception.  An excellent location for sightseeing and shopping and so convenient for Penn station.  We enjoyed two breakfasts in the Tick Tock Diner  which were well cooked and reasonable in price.;4
You can sense the proud history as soon as you step into the imposing lobby of this Art Deco style hotel. Easy to see why it was one of the classiest places in town in its heyday and the fact that it is very busy now just adds to the charm. Stayed four nights in a suite on a higher floor with an amazing view across to the Hudson and the Statue of Liberty in the far distance, very comfortable and quiet. Worth walking to the back to look up and see the famous New Yorker sign. Excellent location, convenient for Penn station, close to the Empire State building, central for major sights and also near to Chelsea and the High Line. Great place.;5
We got to the hotel almost 10 pm and were met by very accommodating staff.  Housekeeping staff were likewise very accommodating and so easy to talk to.   Location was excellent, just a stones throw away from the Penn station, just walking distance to the bus station and of course walking distance to all the shops, restaurants, even daily mass services and the post office and subway...Couldn't ask for anything more. The only downside, which couldn't be helped was that although we were on the 40th floor, we didn't have a view because of the construction right outside our window! Best of all was the supply of coffee, tea, soda and bottled water in our rooms.;5
I had a comfortable and enjoyable stay at the Wyndham New Yorker. A great hotel in Midtown Manhattan. I attended a convention at Javits Center, and I walked. It was so close, and the hotel is near lots of shopping, and taxi stands. Everything was easy too find. I had a great time in New York.;5
Though prices seem high end, mass transit travelers ultimately save by staying at The New Yorker: across from Penn station, walking distance to any midtown attractions, and the area is foodie heaven.  Then, there is the historical significance of this 1929 classic NY hotel, channeling Nikola Tesla, Muhamad Ali, and the Benny Goodman band.  Lower level historical exhibit is very interesting. . .dance floor included an ice rink for ice skating show!  The art deco details are gorgeous from the lettering for elevators to the huge floral arrangement upon entering the lobby.  Finally, the Tick Tock Cafe within the hotel has 24/7 service, again a big convenience for anyone! Skip the bland hotel chains.  Don't believe any whiners on this rating board either, for not to appreciate the;5
This hotel is BUSY and despite the amount of people going in and out of it, the staff is calm, friendly and makes each guest feel special, like they are a VIP and like they are the only person there. We didn't have to wait for anything. We were very impressed with this great welcome by the baggage handlers, reception, security, concierge, etc... Everyone was so nice! the room was clean and comfortable. Yes, ear plugs help, even on the 24th floor because of all the sirens on the streets. The location is PERFECT because it is walking distance to the Empire state building, Time Square and the tourist bus routes. I highly recommend it!;4
If going to stay in this  hotel avoid room # 2201 it's exclusive entrance but it not make sleep all night due of too much noise, coming from the wall ,we complain to the management but no one cares. June 3-6-2017;1
We stayed at the New Yorker this past Monday for one night and it was a beautiful hotel. We arrived earlier than the check in time and the person checking us in was nice enough to find a room that we could check into earlier. The only real complaint I had was... I asked him if it was the same kind of room that we reserved online( a suite with queen bed). Wanted to make sure it had a separate bedroom because we were going with my daughter and her boyfriend and wanted privacy. I had called the hotel prior to make sure it had a separate bedroom and was told yes. He told me that it was indeed a suite but there was no separate bedroom ...no door to the room separating the bedroom from living space. He said of all the rooms in the hotel, there was no separate bedroom. I was super;4
We had an excellent experience staying in this hotel. Excellent location and clean and contemporary room layout. I had a wonderful experience, especially with the extremely helpful concierge lady (Ms. Onelia Green). I could feel that she did everything she could to efficiently solve my booking problem. I've been traveling around the world a lot, and this lady is the one that stood out. Definitely will come back again!;5
The location of this hotel is very convenient,  not to far from Times Square (about 5-6 blocks), near the port authority, Madison square garden, Penn Station. Based on hotels being over-priced in New York I'd say it was a good value. The hotel is dated- It could use some remodeling but I'm sure that would increase pricing even more. My biggest complaint about this hotel was the noise! I stayed on the 22nd floor and could hear EVERY noise outside, police cars, people closing their car doors, people talking/coughing. The noise was so clear that it seemed as if the windows were open and I was on the ground floor. Closing both sets of curtains helped a little and pure exhaustion from walking around the city all day helped a lot! If you're looking for peace and quiet- this may not be;3
We stayed in the 29th floor which has excellent views! The hotel is as classy as a NY hotel can get, not too modern but very stylish. The floors, the elevator, the reception is just as classy as you can imagine a NY hotel. It could be more modern, but the style just outwins the modern style. Despite the rumours, the rooms are clean. Tiny, but clean!;4
On balance given four rating, though really felt more like 3.5. Suspect this was the bees knees in it's hay day, but a little worn at the edges now. Perfectly clean and comfortable however, and excellently situated for exploring NY on our 3 night stay. Paid up front via travel agent as part of longer trip, so was a bit peeved to be presented with a supplementary​ bill on departure for $30 for use of the business centre whatever that is, the spa which we did not use, and the internet which we did!  Perhaps this is usual in US? Trattoria adjoining is very good.;4
We stayed here for 6 nights and, over all, were pleased. The staff was accomodating and helpful. The lobby and common areas were clean and nicely appointed. Our 8th floor, double room, was comfortable and clean. We enjoyed the Keurig coffee maker. The free Wi-fi was fast and reliable. There was an in-room safe. Only two complaints (which we didn't report to management so they didn't have an opportunity to resolve) was a slight mold problem in the shower and an overall unpleasant smell that you noticed when you entered the room. I appreciated the abundance of bath towels provided.;4
I stayed 4 nights in this hotel. It is located in a fantastic part of the city. Penn station is across the street. Times Square is a 5 minute walk. The staff is helpful and friendly. They were fast to respond. Security at the elevators so I never had to feel nervous about who was walking the halls (girls trip). The price was reasonable and we received a free upgrade upon checking in.;5
What can i say other than great location. The hotel needs a total revamp, Considering their were 3 adults in a room it wasn't big enough to swing a cat. The carpet needs to be replaced very old and dirty didn't take my shoes off in room as it looked that dirty thought creatures might be living on the floor. Check in was a nightmare considering long journey was not allowed to check in until after 3pm considering check out is at 11 you would think a room would be done by then, especially when most people check out early anyway. On check out you have to pay for luggage to be kept there if your journey isn't until later, admittedly only £2 but still a cheek. We rang reception for tea or coffee facilities which they did send up to our room, only to be charged £20 dollars for two;3
I made my reservation through hotels.com I booked a metro room. When I arrived l asked to change the room but it wasn't possible till the next day, the front desk manager switched me to an amazing view room. The room has no fridge and no coffee maker it's upon request. The fridge costs 20$ per stay. Yet they offered it for free since I was staying for 9 nights. The only thing is that the carpets and the bed sheets need renovation, they are very old. I hope the management will consider renovating the carpets as they are not healthy for allergic people. Other than that I had an amazing stay and would come back again for sure.;4
We spent a night at the 1070-room Wyndham New Yorker this week, and got everything we expected, and more.  The hotel is an easy, 10- to 15-minute along Eighth Avenue to/from Times Square, but maybe more importantly, it is a block from Penn Station, from which it's an easy walk, even with a rolling suitcase.  This makes the Wyndahm New Yorker a very good choice for any visitor arriving on AMTRAK ... it's not the only full-service hotel in the neighborhood, of course, but in our opinion, it IS the best choice.  We liked the well-preserved Art-Deco ambiance in the lobby, but the smallish guest rooms, were newly decorated in a contemporary motif, and ours had a large walk-in shower in a small but adequate bathroom.  We thought that the public areas and guest rooms were accurately;4
We have just returned from a few nights in NYC staying at the New Yorker Hotel. First of all, its location. Situated on W34th and 8th, it is within a couple of minutes walk of NY Penn Station and the subway line A, C & E. As with most of uptown Manhattan, it is walkable and relatively easy to find your way around. You are staying fairly close to the Empire State Building, 15 minutes walk from Broadway and similar to Times Square. Perhaps 30 minutes walk to Central Park. There are plenty of food outlets close to the hotel, including a McDonalds and a Starbucks right opposite the entrance.  So the hotel. You walk into quite a palacial reception. Very art deco design. Got checked in by a very welcoming receptionist. It is worth asking for a refurbished room or a room with a view at;4
I'm not accustomed to staying in a big city so this was new to me.  I expected at $300 a night it would be a similar room to what I've stayed in at other locations (cities but not as big as NYC).    The room was really small.  But it was clean.  I'm not sure if the odor was in the room or just the city in general.    By default, there is no coffee maker in the room.  You can request one.  I did this the second day after reading other online reviews.  Along with the coffee maker, I got a bag of four paper cups, a bunch of pods of coffee and tea.  But they never replaced anything that I've used so by the end of my stay, I was struggling to have coffee and tea when I wanted it.  It was hard to find a location to sit my coffee maker.  The small table was big enough for my laptop.  I;4
Easy and comfortable place to rest your head- small rooms but standard for New York. Very welcoming on check in- great with information and time spent giving us guidance. Beds were comfortable and easy to get around staying here again soon due to reliability. Office facilities and bookings available with a restaurant below too. Grand entrance Art Deco style.;4
Great Stay! Mohammed, at the front desk was extremely friendly and accommodating. He made our stay that much better! Would definitely recommend.  The rooms were large and very comfortable. The hotel was very impressive for NYC.;5
Be aware that there are many kinds (and prices) of rooms. The ones I've had during my five stays at the hotel were excellent, spacious and with great views (others I saw were smaller, and lacked views). Although it is a huge hotel, the staff is helpful, housekeeping works well, and the general condition of the hotel is very good and has improved over the past years (several rooms have been renovated). It has a very convenient 24/7 restaurant beside it (practically within the hotel) and a subway station at the corner. What else is there to ask? Will return!;5
This is a total tourist hotel. It's in a great area for the Empire State Building, 34th street Times Sq etc and is one of New York's busiest soits but not generally in a great area as lots of dodgy characters About particularly on the corner of west 35th for some reason. I know New York very well so already knew this wasn't the best area but the hotel was booked for me.  It's so dated, too dated regardless of all its 'Art Deco' ness its old, very old furniture very tatty looking and musty. The elevator doors opened on my floor and my heart sank, dark, dingy, musty..just horrible. The elevators themselves are like hospital lifts, Lino floors..old! The hotel I gather think it's 1920s style is quirky but nothing much seems to have done since it was built, even the wallpaper in the;3
After a delayed flight arrived at The New Yorker to warm welcome at check in. Room was basic, clean but adequate, bathrooms could do with updating. Had breakfast in the Tick Tock Diner, quick and pleasant service.  Dined in Biana Trattoria one evening service was slow, meal average and bar staff more interested in her phone than serving drinks.  Disappointing when we approached information asking how best to get to baseball game. Guy on information disinterested and said that reminded him to ring his son back and promptly picked up his mobile phone and made a call leaving us stood there. We walked away thinking this was very rude. Overall we enjoyed  our stay just a few customer service issues.;3
Very comfortable and convenient. 2 blocks from Penn station and the buses out of New York.  Good value for money! Perfect for exploring Manhattan. I would definitely go back. The room was clean and quiet and the morning Espresso was wonderful.;5
Stayed here for 5 nights and it was great! Very close to the subway (Penn station across the street) Starbucks and McDonald's across the street for a quick morning coffee/tea and any kind of restaurant you want within walking distance. There is always lots of people around so we felt safe anytime day or night. The room was small but clean....it's New York...we didn't go to stay in our room 😉. Would definitely recommend to friends and would book again.;5
this hotel is set in a great location to see all the sights, its very clean and the staff are so nice and helpful, this hotel is very wheelchair  friendly,  and the dinner in the hotel was excellent its called TICK TOCK, we used it for the week we stayed there good price for a meal not dare and you wont come out hungry, OH if yous are flying in to Newark airport DON T get ripped of by the taxis at the airport, they wanted 100 dollars to take us to wyndham newyorker hotel,  get the air train  from the airport its free to the railway station, buy your ticket there 12  dollars each, and the train drops you off at with in 500 meters a stroll to hotel,  macy,s store is right next door where you can buy tickets for every thing you want to see in new York, my last tip for any one in a;5
"We spent 14 nights at The New Yorker. Room was clean and bed very comfy. We had originally booked a Metro Double and were ""upgraded"" to a one bed shoebox with great views. I wonder if the room with 2 beds would have afforded us more space. The views weren't worth the size of the room. Room was sooo tiny. Walls paper thin. Barely any room to store our suitcases. Wardrobe so tiny, I think if we had coats to hang, the door wouldn't have closed. Bathroom tiny also. We found the staff, with the exception of housekeeping, to be very indifferent and made no effort to be friendly. The hotel is in a convenient location, but it's just not the nicest location. I would never stay here or in this part of the city again.";3
I have stayed in this hotel 3 times at this stage and the thing that draws me to it every time is its location. It's within walking distance to Macy's and the Empire and Penn Station is just around the corner.  The rooms themselves can be small, but I suppose that's to be expected in New York City. We had problems with the wifi when we first arrived & rang reception, after a hour or two the problem was rectified but the wifi wasn't very strong in our room which was a little disappointing.  The diner next door is ideal for a quick breakfast before heading out into the city with a great selection & good service.  The location is definitely the selling point of this hotel for me.;4
Stayed in The New Yorker for 4 nights 20-23 May 2017. One adult two children, grand hotel with a great location. Room was not ready on arrival had an hour wait even though we were delayed due to flights/traffic (the roads are horrendous) complimentary breakfast was granted after asking.  Hotel is grand upon entrance, rooms particularly bathroom a little dated but it did the job. Room was too small for the three of us and not enough plug sockets, no kettle but there is an iron and hair dryer and the beds are comfy.  Restaurant onsite serves something for everyone, we ate breakfast which was nice. And theres a large foyer with wifi and charging facilities for devices.   Location is fab, cinemas, five guys, Dunkin Donuts, Mc Donald's and Starbucks walking distance. Loads to see and;4
Good location near to Macy's and Times Square. Downside is bathroom badly needed updating couldn,t have a bath because enamel peeling so could only use shower . Walls paper thin when next door used shower at 2am. It woke us up thought they in our room also bathroom shelf tiny and floor in bathroom needed replacing. This aside the ticktock diner was good for breakfast and we had cocktails in italian in hotel which was nice also. I paid 160 pounds for 6 nights resort fee which I think really steep . Would only return if better bathroom;3
My stay at The New Yorker has been the worst stay at any hotel I have ever experienced. When you get to the hotel the Lobby is very busy and very nice. The buzz gives you a real feel of the city. The hotel is on a central location with easy transport connections. This is where the beauty of the hotel ends. Firstly, I was told the rate of the room was $159 plus tax, my total bill came too $260. When I tried to pay cash, I was told the hotel does not accept cash. Even though you are given that option when making a reservation. I was given a room on the 21st floor. When you come out of the elevator you are met with an old musky smell and a very dirty brown carpet. Nothing like the decor that you are presented with when you first enter the hotel. On getting to the room we were met;2
Room very small.  Bathroom is so outdated and in dire need of a makeover.   All renovation was in the lobby to impress, but once you got to the room gosh beware.  Will never stay there again.  Hotel staff was friendly enough though.  Restaurant adjourning hotel makes it very convenient.;1
The area has deteriorated since I knew it well 20 years ago,  having worked in the area for many years.  But this hotel is a hallmark and oasis.  Looks great, is clean, good food on premises and especially,  the friendly and helpful staff.;5
A verry nice  hotel in center off New York. everthing was nice an clean but mayby a litle old  not far from everything you want to se in New York. use the breakfast bar just 50 meters left when exit  the hotel we realy loved the hole week we staid at this hotel. Next time we will order this hotel again.;4
The hotel was great. Bought theatre tickets from the Concierge and 2 as charged $70 US each over and above the box office price. That was $140 extra!!! My gosh highway robbery. Bloody big tip if you ask me. This actually soured some of my holiday in New York. Tip: no matter what do not purchase from the hotel.  Beds extremely comfortable,  rooms small but we knew that when we booked from research. Bathrooms very dated and need an overhaul. Rooms lovely and clean and the staff very courteous. Would recommend staying.;3
The first star is for the Nespresso coffee.  The next is for proximity to times Square.  The bad things? Oh man, where do I start!  The room walls are flimsy. You can hear everything and everyone whispering in the corridor, or banging someone upstairs, or just laughing.  The bathrooms have no locks! You can't lock from inside.  Plus the bathrooms have no ventilation. So all the smells waft gently into the main room. The thermostat was built in 1930s and  has stayed that way since then.  Too hit, or too cold and zero air circulation.  No coffee machine jn room.  No water spouts on the corridor and they want us to drink tap water from a smelly bathroom.  Too small toilets.  The elevator creaks all the way up and down.  The room carpets are carried over from 30s. The only claim to;2
It's a great place in a great location. Really close to the Madison Square Garden. It's really clean and the service is good. Rooms are big and comfortable. A good place to go with the family or for business trip. Friendly people around. Positive!;5
Older style hotel with the character of the past. My daughter and I had a very roomy double corner room overlooking Madison Sq Garden. Quiet, for being in the city. The most comfortable pillows I want to find for home!! No complaints EXCEPT, room windows had some drafts, needed better weatherproofing in bathroom. We still loved the place and also the enjoyed the Tick Tock Diner located on the first floor. Got a very reasonable price on their website.  Close to some many things, across from Penn Station (Amtrak), Madison Sq Garden, Macy's, on a couple of blocks from Times Sq, in Chelsea/Hell's Kitchen area.;4
The New Yorker is a great location, beautiful facility and is bolstered by great staff. The lobby is stunning, and the facility is true to its historic roots. My room on the 7th floor seemed recently updated and was super clean, light, and functional for a small'ish space. I was traveling for business and had sufficient desk space to work, and to relax after. The location was super-convenient for a lovely morning run to famous sites including central park, and for getting to the work site, followed by getting to the train. The staff - to a person - were super friendly and helpful. not waiting to be approached, but sincerely offering help and ideas. AND I felt really comfortable/safe in the space. Wins all way round.;5
The hotel is in a good area with lots of stuff nearby. The lobby was impressive but the rooms very outdated and in need of upgrades. However, very clean and staff were helpful. There's two decent restaurants attached which was convenient. All in all a good choice.;4
Just a couple of blocks from the Empire State, The Wyndham New Yorker is an ideal place to stay, located on corner of 34th St and 8th Ave, it has two eateries attached Tick Tock diner is a basic diner open 24 hrs, we didn't go in the other more up market restaurant. We must have walked on average 24'000 steps a day for 4 days , from Staten Island ferry to Central Park and all the other tourist attractions in the centre. The Tavern on the green in Central Park was a lovely place to have a drink whilst the sun shone brightly.;4
Hotels in NYC are small and expensive but that's the price you pay to stay here. This was our second stay at the Wyndham New Yorker so we knew what we were getting. It's a large hotel and usually crowded. Lots of elevators so waiting wasn't an issue.   Room was spacious enough but as noted here, bathroom is small and old. Everything works and you don't spend a lot of time in the room so not an issue. Windows open to allow city air to come through but keeps out noise when closed.  Best aspect of the hotel is location. A block away from Penn Station, a few blocks from Mega bus and close to subways.;4
I visited New York for my 21st Birthday. We booked this hotel based on reviews we had read and it's location.   Location is perfectly central, opposite the Madison Sq Garden it provided excellent views. We were within walking distance of everything and right next door to the subway station which we used every single day and really got the hang of it! Life saver!  Excellent service and excellent wifi. Very clean. Bedroom was brilliant size with everything we could of wanted. Only negative (which isn't really a negative just personal opinion) is that the bathroom does need updating. A little shabby and old fashioned looking with a poor shower. Never the less it did the job and we were happy!  As for the hotel over all it screams New York! Classic looking lobby, spacious, helpful;4
3 of us stayed in the New Yorker for 4 nights from 27th April 2017, for my 50th. We stayed here 6 years ago for my sister's 40th Birthday, loved it so much, so came back. Our initial impression was of disappointment. It is a gorgeous, impressive hotel but beginning to look a bit shabby. Putting that aside, we had a totally amazing stay here!! The staff are all superb, apart from the miserable barmaid. Everyone bent over backwards to make our stay there perfect and to make my 50th memorable. If you need help with anything, ask John in transportation and tell him the witches from England sent you 😊;4
"Older building, well located near Penn Station. Very competitive rates. Though a few areas in the building are a touch ""shabby"" (i.e. the halls) the rooms are nice, the beds comfortable and the public areas are enjoyable. All I needed! Some nice Art Deco touches as well.";4
The New Yorker is in a perfect location.  It also has two restaurants on site which are very good and a small cafe where you can purchase sodas, danish, etc.  You can request a refrigerator and/or coffee maker without extra charge.  Security is excellent.  You have to show your room key to access the elevators.  Staff is friendly and will go out of their way to help you with your requests.;5
Stopped in NYC for a few days for my birthday after our return flight from the Virgin Islands. Loved the cozy room, views, old style tiled bathroom, location, easy access to Times Square, subway and bus station. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would definately stay again.;5
Checkin was prompt and courteous. I was phoned when our room was available, a courteous and thoughtful touch. I want to give accolades to CLAY, and I hope this is his name, who was extremely concerned for our safety during the time of the horrific accident near Broadway. We four women asked direction to the Broadway Diner. He courteously land pleasantly pointed us in the right direction. Later on, when speaking with him again, he expressed how worried he was about us considering the car accident that killed a young girl was in the same vicinity toward which he pointed us. He was worried we were some of those injured. How thoughtful of him to think of us! We were so impressed! Thank you, Clay! As for the hotel itself, it was clean, the bed extremely comfortable as were the heavy,;5
First and foremost, I would never write a horrible review for a business unless I am utterly and beyond expressions dissatisfied. My husband and I decided to take a long over due day or two to ourselves to enjoy a stress free possible couple of days, as we have 3 small children, both work, and are both students. We decided to book this hotel based on its reviews that we thought were pretty decent. We check in Friday May 19th 2017, leave our things and decide to go nightlife exploring. Upon our return around 2:30am, after getting ready to get into bed I remove the decorative runner placed at the foot of the bed and find a horrendous looking striped brown colored stain on the sheet covering the comforter. I called the front desk to request new linens, the operator told me she;1
This is a fabulous Art Deco building, with real character, and the location is amazing (3 mins walk to macys, and the Empire State building!). The room, altho not massive, was a fairly good size compared to other New York hotels I have been in. The bathroom was compact and a little dated, but if you are in New York City and not out and about then something is seriously wrong! The staff could not have been nicer. I would much rather stay here than a characterless big chain, and I look forward to returning. My only slight critiscsm was I couldn't get my phone to pick up the wifi signal in the room, only the iPad would.;4
My stay at the hotel went well. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and went out of their way to make sure things went well.   The hotel is really busy with guest from all over the world. My room was really small but cozy.   The one con I experienced was that the chair in the room seem to have the worst smell I ever smelled in my life. The rooms could use a little more cleaning.   Overall, my stay was quick and went well.   Best,  Lew;3
an absolute superior location with renovated accommodations that hold true to the original Art Deco flair. Rates that are reasonably priced compared to competitors . Staff is friendly , facility is clean , safe and secure;5
It is very amazing .the place is very nice. The quality of the food is high.l Will visit this place again .and l'am so happy when l go to this place .and the service is very good.so the decoration in this place is very nice;4
The location near Penn Station is a so great because it was a quick and easy walk to the hotel, checked in and were quickly on our way to our fun destinations.;5
This hotel may not be the most glamorous in MidTown, however the hotel is clean and in a great location.  The staff is extremely hospitable and the bell team is on point.    Wonderful restaurants in the neighborhood.;5
Have stayed at this hotel twice with family and was treated well by the management and staff both times. The rooms we occupied were clean and well maintained. Tick Toc diner off the main lobby was a fine and interesting place to get dinner one night,;5
We stayed 8 nights at The New Yorker. It was a very clean, central positioned hotel. Reception staff were fantastic checking us in early after a long flight and half the morning walking around NYC. There rooms are not big, we didn't spend a lot of time in the room, so it was enough. The view from our room was spectacular, looking over the city and seeing the Empire State Building change colours each night.  We walked all over midtown Manhattan from this location. Tick Toc diner attached to the hotel is fantastic for breakfast and we also had a couple of dinners here. Food is quick, great value and service is great.  They just need to get a cartoon Channel, as I clocked up quite a bill buying cartoons for my kids to watch at night.  I would stay at the New Yorker again, we loved;5
"This property was pretty nice, I liked my room with a few exceptions: 1) I got a Queen Bed View Suite (40th/top floor), which I thought would look over the city, but instead looked over the river.  Also the windows in the rooms are not very large but that comes more down to it being an older building... and the bathroom for the ""suite"" is just o a fairly plain bathroom, with hot water so I thought the view suite was not really worth the extra money it cost.    The aspect of the suite that was really nice is the bed was in a operate room with doors, so someone could work while one person was sleeping - and the two rooms had separate thermostats.  It also had a decent desk and a small bar with a fridge.  The staff was super friendly and helped me get a room a bit early so I could";4
For what I paid for the accommodations, i expected much more. I understand that obtaining a hotel in the York is extremely expensive no matter which proprietor you choose  however if you pay for a suite it should be worthy of calling it such. The location is absolutely excellent but the interior was extremely small and out of date. The weather was 90 degrees and the air conditioning system was not blowing cool air.;3
Good hotel in a great place and price . The hotel is very clean , close to the pen station and other subways stations. The room that we get has a great view to 34 street and the Empire state building.;5
Did like the location of the New Yorker, we walked everywhere from our hotel. Rooms were small, but expected that from NY. Beds were very comfortable. Staff were great at helping out on our room confusions when we arrived. Don't really have much more to say about this hotel;3
I stayed twice at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel and I am quite satisfied for the quality of service and of the room for this hotel in New York.  I can say the restaurant is so so and every morning is a line-up for the breakfast, so you have to go outside, but beside that, I am pleased with this hotel.    However, I would like to teach people staying at a hotel, this is not a community ground and by respect to other people, you should close your door properly and not slam it.  I had two nights at the hotel and I have someone on this floor that first of all, decide to talk on his phone in the hallways, secondly, I have another person, I don't know if they were fighting, but he/she closed her room door and all the walls shaked!!!  Respect - they don't know!;4
Great location for midtown,chelsea and the subway downtown  The lobby is spacious and cool,  the staff are friendly and helpful  We were upgraded to the Muhammad Ali room  by Muhammad on the desk  We loved it ✌️thank you  Lots of cool bars in the area and delis for coffee and things to eat  Nice walk up 8th to the times square area or along 34th Street to the empire state building and 5th avenue Our third trip to new York we stayed at the Roosevelt twice in the past which is also a great place But next time it's the new Yorker;5
Very large hotel, well restored with a lot of character. Many elevators, but not sure they all work as we always seemed to wait for the same two.  Security visually looks at your key before approaching the elevators so safe feeling. Everyone was nice.  Two restaurants on site, one is 24 hours and more casual, the second serves food to about 10pm, with bar open for a few hours after.  Bathrooms and room s in general are very small, typical of New York hotels in the city.  Doorman does not assist you at any point in time, nice touch however just wave hello as he is probably on his cell phone anyway. Housekeeping forgot to refresh my room for two days, so keep an eye out for them.  Everyone at checkin was very nice.;4
At first I was having a lot of commication problems after booking 2 rooms for us and our family coming from UK to America for the first time. I finally dealt with the night shift Manager and then his boss Dell! I was so frustrated with all the communication problems and after addressing my concerns they reassured me everything would be just fine during our stay. They went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant. My family from UK loved the hotel and EVERYTHziNG was perfect thanks to Dell and I want to sa Andy was the other Gents name.  The rooms are very nice and clean, the housekeeping personnel were great and pleasant.  The Hotel has a lot of history behind it.  They have a Diner called the Tick Tock which serves great food and good service.  I would recommend this zhotel;5
We stayed here for 5 nights,my first time to New York! Lovely hotel,lovely staff,very secure with round the clock security to rooms access. Short walk to all the major attractions. Highly recommended,will stay here again.;5
Having stayed here a few years ago, I returned as I knew the location. I was given a small room but when I commented about it the lovely staff moved me to a larger room with a river view. Room clean and spacious. Staff really friendly from doorman, clean cleaners and front desk. Location perfect ten minutes from high line and Macy's around the corner. Tick Tock restaurant handy for breakfast. Left New York for a couple of days before returning to hotel were receptionist remembered me by name. Will definitely stay again when visiting the city.;5
My experience in the New Yorker has been deplorable. It is a dirty old fashioned hotel that does not deserve a single night on. The stairs used to accede the bedrooms smell horribly (attached photo of the condition of the stairs) and it is definitively not a friendly place. The security guards are quite impertinent and unwilling to help. I'll never recommend it to anyone, since it is definitely the opposite of what I expect in a hotel.;1
We frequently stay at this property and it is ALWAYS a great experience. It is centrally located and offers a lot of options for guests.  Highly recommended!;5
Nice property. The first room that I checked into was not only very small, but very old.  Although it seemed clean, it was very worn down and it had the feel of a cheap motel.  The front desk clerk changed my room and was very apologetic.  The new room that I received was still small, but it had a much better feel and smelled 10 times better.;3
The Wyndham New Yorker is the perfect Hotel for any visit to New York. With Madison Square Garden parked less than 50 metres from the front door and a subway stop and railway station there also you're in ideal location for getting around.  The staff in the hotel are polite, friendly and very helpful. As we were on honeymoon the receptionist kindly upgraded our room and we were left with an amazing view of the City from our windows with the Empire State Building staring us in the face.  The food in the restaurant was very nice and was at a very reasonable price.;5
We arrived at 9 in the morning after a sleepless flight from Hawaii. We were able to check in early at a cost of 75 dollars which were were happy to accept. We had a lovely room and a great bed. The facilities had all been updated since our previous stay.  All the staff are so helpful. We went to the Tick Tock diner downstairs for breakfast and saw all the same staff who were there on our previous stay. They said some had been there over 20 years. When checking out you can leave your luggage there if necessary for a nominal charge. We also had a meal one evening in the excellent in house restaurant.;5
I got a room with great views over Manhattan, mine was small but I understand they have different sizes, that wasn't a problem for me, it also has a very good gym for a hotel this sort in mid Manhattan, the staff was very helpful and the location was perfect for bars restaurants and shopping, perfect for a getaway in town;4
Lovely hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. Great at giving u accurate directions. Security is great!!! Must show room card to get to elevators..excellent idea. Rooms were kept clean and housemaid was lovely and helpful too.;5
This iconic Midtown Manhattan behemoth of a hotel was once the place to be.  Sadly, time and economic realities have taken their toll. Still beautiful in it's Art Deco architcture, rooms are small for 2 but adequate for solo stays & run around $200+ per night If you're in town for mostly theatre, this location is perfect. Minutes by subway to all Theatre District locations. Close to Macy's and Herald Square for shopping.;3
I loved my stay here... Staff were helpful...Rooms immaculately clean every time we returned after a days exploring. The diner was also good. Fast service. Fantastic view from room...planning on a return trip for sure!;5
The New Yorker is in a great area - easy to walk to the Empire State or Times Square etc.  Our room was pretty small but I'm not the kind of person that spends long in the room - I just use it as a base.  The decor was nice and it was comfortable and it didn't take long for the air con to cool the room or then the heating heat it up again when you wanted to be a bit cosier.  There was a nice little Diner called Tick Tock which you could access from the Hotel lobby, or from outside the hote.  Hotel staff were very helpful too.;4
We took Amtrak to NYC and when we exited Penn station, we could see the New Yorker Hotel. The hotel was conveniently located for a fabric buying expedition since it was near the garment district. Macy's is near by as well. The rooms were fine, view of the Empire State Building, good mattresses, tv, desk and 2 chairs. The bathroom was updated but the pedestal sink provides little storage. All aspects of service were good. The Tic Tock Diner was located within the hotel building, accessible through the lobby. the rooms accommodated 4 women willing to share and cooperate. We chose this hotel primarily for its location and were very satisfied.;5
Just back from a 5 night stay in The New Yorker , this a great hotel quite a central location . This hotel is just around the corner from Macy's department store and the Empire State Building. Not to far from the port authority bus station , Times Square and the theatre district. The hotel itself was more than adiquate for our stay comfortable room maybe a little dated but then it was only for sleeping in and getting washed,you don't go to New York to spend time in your room . The receptionist at the from desk at check in was very pleasant she gave us a voucher for breakfast at the tick tock diner as it was my friends birthday , we never managed to have anything at the other restaurant at the hotel wished we had as looking at the menu it looked well priced . The receptionist at;4
Built in 1929 this hotel has all the marking of a classic hotel.  The room while older are neat and tidy and relatively large by New York standards.  Staff were all very pleasant and helpful and the location couldn't be better.  Within walking distance of the Empire State and Times Square it is in the busy Garment district and close to many of the core shops.  I would definitely stay here again while in New York.;4
This hotel has a great location right across the street from Penn Station.  The Art Deco design of the hotel is delightful.  We enjoyed the Tick Tock Diner for lunch and the room was clean and comfortable.  Will stay again.;5
Stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms on the 8th floor.  At first I was kinda hesitant due to the lower floor as my original room was on the 29th floor. But I was offered this upgrade and I'm glad I took it. It was a very nice updated room with a view. The noise from the street was not a factor at all.   Because of my hotel status, I was able to check in early.  The front desk clerk was very helpful. The lobby is spacious, inviting and very open. Security guards check guests's key card before entering the elevators - a nice benefit.   In addition to a nice bed, the room has a single cup coffee maker and two bottles of water.  The flat screen TV is analog. This was a surprise as it should have been digital.  The Tick Tock Diner next door is very convenient to grab a quick;5
It was a very small room in a very large hotel. The room had one small window that faces a brick wall. Everything in the room was old and needed to be updated. I felt like I was staying in an old closet;3
Great location, easy to get to. Friendly staff & concierge, Susie was great. Room was clean & decent size for age of hotel. Easy access back to Lincoln tunnel. Hector, valet, got us a cab at rush hour when we were told it would take an hour.;4
Difficult to recommend this hotel, to be honest. Check in process is about the least efficient I've seen.  Anywhere. Ever.  I experienced a line 20-25 people long, with no particular urgency on the part of staff.   Rooms are tiny, but functional.  Noise is a problem, not from the city outside, but from the hallway.  Expect to hear every conversation that takes place outside your door.   The location is near Penn Station, but not much else, frankly.  So while the price may be right, you'll likely be happier elsewhere.;2
Large art deco hotel.  Conveniently located across the street from Penn Station. 24 hour dinner in hotel was great for breakfast. Arrived early and had to wait to check in.  I was told at the registration desk that they had upgraded my room.  When check in time arrived I was told they took the upgrade away. My grandson and I went to our room, which was the smallest hotel room I was ever in.  The view from the window was a brick wall.  My grandson turned on the TV and it didn't work. I called the desk and they told me to come back down and they gave us a different room. The new room was a lot bigger and the TV worked.  The staff were very nice.  The added on resort fee and taxes  brought the price of one night to $300. It's NYC and all the hotels are pricey.  The location was;3
It is quite rare to find a hotel these days in New York that pays attention to hygiene, cleanliness [of the rooms, bathrooms]. It is also quite rare to feel appreciated by housekeeping staff! This was reflected during our brief stay. We arrived tired, after a very long journey from Europe - just before midnight, requesting whether the bed-linen of the sofa in the reserved suite was available - well in advance of our reservation - This was truly organised within 10 minutes of our checking in. The staff member concerned, felt embarrassed by our wanting to help out with unfolding the sofa! On checking out, and leaving our suite - it was truly noteworthy of the staff members in the corridor - thanking us for staying and for wishing us a safe journey home. (They saw us with our;5
The hotel is somewhat dated but clean. Some of the rooms have been updated.  The room was clean, we had two bathrooms, which was a plus.The location is perfect for exploring the city. Everyone at the hotel was very helpful and courteous.;5
After a long trip into the city the hotel was a cheerful site even with the scaffolding. Mohammed was great and gave us an upgrade after we explained what went wrong. Our room was spacious, the staff polite at all times. The hotel may need upgrading a little but we thought it added to the charm. We ate at the Diner next door and had no complaints. Great location as within walking to distance to all everything or alternatively hop on the tube. Would definitely stay there again;4
Just stayed here one night and I think it's a good spot. Great Art Deco lobby with door into good diner. The rooms are fine, some are too small but mine had two double beds so enough space. The bathrooms are very tired but I quite like the old Art Deco.;4
Small room. We got dirty sheets. And I discovered bites, bedbugs.. Terrible service at check in, the person behind the desk aswered the telephone, and talked for 5 minitues while we just stood there waiting..  Will not stay here again.;2
We believe this has a somewhat negative image but we really liked this hotel. It has a fascinating history and is really well placed for a trip to NYC. A bonus is the the Tick Tock diner is integral to the building and it is well worth having breakfast there.  We didn't have a full view window but it would be worth asking for especially on a high floor.;4
This was our second visit. The rooms are small but have everything you need. This one had a large desk and chair which for us was a waste of space. Perhaps the room was meant for a solo traveller. The room was not as good as our first stay as there really wasn't a view and although we were on the 22 floor, during the night we were woken up by cars driving over huge metal plates on 34th Street. I thought we had pot holes in England but this is rediculous!;4
Stayed one night for business in May 2017.  The room was clean, the hotel was Deco palatial int he lobby, but the rooms are small, and the bathroom was the smallest one I've ever been in--including on a cruise ship.  No room for even a tissue box.  Could not use the toilet with the door open.  Towels a little ragged at the edges.  Toilets flush with industrial force--and you can hear the toilets from rooms above and below and to either side of you--also hear faucets running.  And the street noise is unfiltered--hear it all night long too.  Can't reach the curtains, so good luck trying to block the light.  Pillows smelt like essence of old man hair--they need some freshening badly.;3
Stunning hotel right in the center on Manhattan, our room had a stunning view from the 37th floor, the hotel is very art deco & well maintained but I felt that the rooms could do with a bit of a freshening up as some of the fixtures & fitting were looking a little old & tired but apart from that I would highly recommend this place but avoid the restaurant as it was horrible, the diner which is open 24 hours on the other hand was very pleasant. Please note that there is a charge for house keeping which you are billed for at the end which I was not made aware of on arrivle.;4
Wonderful hotel in a very central location. A couple of blocks from Time Square and The Empire State Building is all within walking distance. Beds were very comfortable and rooms were quaint. Enjoyed my stay here!;4
This was our first trip to New York and was only a 2 night stay before traveling on. On booking this hotel I was aware that it had history and from the Art Deco period. It was beautiful, full of charm and style of the period. Absolutely loved it!! Yes, I would admit it could do with a freshen up in places and I am sure in time it will get done. Our room was on the 26th floor? It was tucked around a corner, seemed to back onto the lifts and at times a clunking noise could be heard, but wasn't enough to bother us. View was not of the Empire State Building, that didn't bother us. There was no excessive noise and definitely no cooking smells in our room as smentioned in other comments.If you don't understand Art Deco you proberbly wouldn't understand the decor, fixture and fittings,;5
This was our second stay at The New Yorker and we weren't disappointed. The hotel is in a perfect central location to see downtown and uptown manhattan. Close to Penn station you can access most subway links. Clear view of The Empire State Building from many rooms. The diner serves a great breakfast and for a more upmarket evening meal the Trattoria is lovely. Staff are always friendly and extremely helpful. Thanks to Mohammed on reception who made the check in process smooth and quick. Will definitely return here again;5
This wonderful Art Deco hotel is in a fabulous location right near Penn station/ Maddison Square Garden. It has everything around it you need.  The staff on check in were extremely friendly and wanted to make sure we were happy with our room selection.  We stayed 10 nights and requested a room as high as possible. We were put on the 31st floor in a big, clean room with 2 queen beds, and Importantly, a view of the Empire State Building. It was breathtaking looking out at the view, particularly at night.  The hotel had everything you need including restaurants, a well equipped gym, business centre, mail centre and an extremely helpful concierge. I had nail delivered whilst in New York and this was facilitated seamlessly by hotel staff.  We did not have coffee and tea making;4
Loved the hotel and awesome deli in lobby.  Close to everything, Macys across the street. rooms are big and beds are comfy.  You can walk to everything very easily and the staff is amazing!!!  The décor is old Art deco style and fancy.  You will feel like you've been transported to another time.  I highly recommend it and it's a great price too!;5
Room was on 23rd floor very cold and noisy, there was no view, room could do with up dating. also kitchen smells in the room. Staff very helpful and friendly and great location. Shame we were disappointed as this was our first visit to New York City.;3
Stayed at the New Yorker over Easter weekend.Arrived at lunch time room was ready very quick check in. Room was a little dated but very clean and comfortable. We had a corner room with a view. The room was very quite best 3 nights sleep in a city hotel ever.We will back sooner rather than later loved it.;4
Our room was great. The hotel is older and does show some wear, but that is part of the charm. The location was great, not right in Times Square but a very do able walk to Times Square. Meant that we did not have the all night noise from TS. Across the street from Penn Station, so it was VERY convenient to catch our Amtrak train on the day we checked out. Really loved the location. Reasonably priced for the area. Room was very clean and comfortable. Our room actually had two bathrooms which was great since we had 3 women staying in it!;5
We arrived early after an overnight flight from Hawaii, exhausted.  Room not ready, ok no problem we expected that, but felt the reception were really stroppy with us and they could have been more pleasant and tried to give us a more informed time as to when it would be ready rather than the standard line.  Room fine, small as expected, bathroom needed a bit of a refit really.  Reception also tried to charge us the resort fee, even though my confirmation clearly stated that this was not applicable for travel Jan-Mar.;4
From front desk to housekeeping staff, everyone at the New Yorkers was professional, friendly, courteous, and extraordinarily helpful. I haven't stayed here in a couple of years because prices increased out of my range, but I was able to find an affordable (for NY) room once more at my favorite place to stay in the city.;5
"The New Yorker Hotel was a great selection for this trip.  It is centrally located and its closeness to the train station and the subway lines makes it a terrific starting point for whatever activities you have planned for the day.  The New Yorker, as with real estate, comes down to ""location, location, location"".  The location was ideal and the service was equally impressive.";4
We had six adult women staying in one room.  It was a bit cramped but the view was really great.  We were on the 39th floor.  Two dbl beds in the bedroom were a bit tight for adults and a queen size sofa sleeper.  Price was reasonable since it was split among all of us.  The room was clean and comfortable otherwise and a great location for midtown.  The staff was helpful and courteous.  Check-in would have been much faster had I checked my email and known keys were waiting at the rewards desk.;4
"Paid extra for ""City View "" and early check in.  There wasn't a room available when we arrived  (after 1pm) and when we did get a room, we were greeted by a view of a brick wall.  If you put your face against the window and looked at an angle, you could see part of a great view.  It is an old property, so I expected the rooms to be small, and it was. The bathroom was extremely cramped with no place to set personal care items.  The decor was nice, the bed comfortable and the room was clean, but ovetall the stay was rather disappointing.";3
"Styled in 1920's we were lucky when we arrived that our room was ready as we were very early. 20th floor metro room faced down 34th street, looking over Penn Street station & Madison Square Gardens down to the Empire State Building.  2 ""Double"" sized beds were slightly smaller than a standard UK size double bed but were very comfortable.  Bathroom could do with an update (I believe that they are currently doing this) but was clean and enough for our short visit.  Great location for sightseeing.  Would definitely recommend but would request a higher floor maybe.  Ticktock diner downstairs was ok, friendly service. We did get croissants & fruit salad from the takeaway bar in reception.";4
We were there only for one night to go to Kleinfelds Bridal Shop. The hotel wasn't too far away if you don't mind walking, which we didn't. It was also not a bad walk to Times Square and Macys. I booked a suite because there were 4 of us, and it was a good size. The half bath was a nice surprise. There were also 2 refrigerators. All of the staff were friendly and helpful, especially one of the doormen, whose name, unfortunately I can't remember. He recommended a pizza place and gave easy walking directions to Times Square and would not let me tip him until after I got back from both. Needless to say, I gave him a great tip. There was one issue with the roll-a-way bed, and I brought it to the attention of the front desk, it was taken care of quickly. All in all, this really is a;5
The New Yorker hotel was the perfect location for our NYC stay. It was maybe 5 blocks from time square but still in the middle of everything yet slightly outside of the madness. The rooms are affordable and staff are super helpful. There are a ton of bars around and foods spots. The hotel sits right on a subway entrance so if you're not into paying for a cab, 3 bucks on the subway can get you far. There are also 2 drug stores near by in case you forgot something.;5
The poor service from this hotel actually began a few weeks before. An email I sent asking for some Amtrak advice went unanswered - no big deal.  But on arrival things quickly went downhill. The first room we were allocated was a tiny corner room where both aspects managed to look onto brick walls. The WC was defective (flushed constantly) so we asked for another room. This was even smaller and again the only window looked directly against a brick wall. Staff finally agreed to a room on an upper floor (36th) which was acceptable but why was this not allocated first? Could it be that room allocations are prejudiced against those who book through travel companies?   However :- - the AC was noisy so we turned it off at night. During the first night we both woke up cold and there;1
I've stayed here several times. Each time I've been its the people I've travelled with that have made the holiday, rather than the hotel. The rooms are ok, apparently recently had a makeover, but our group of 3 were disappointed with the room allocated to us. We went to reception to ask if they had another room that would best suit our needs.  The staff were amazing. We ended up changing suites 3 times until we got what we were comfortable with. Special shout out to Driss on reception. He bent over backwards to make our stay enjoyable after our complaints about our room. But an even bigger shout out to John in transportation. He started helping our party out weeks before we even got there, arranging things for our visit via email. Nothing was too much trouble for him or any of;3
"We stayed for 2 nights in the hotel (standard room) and after the first night started to think about other options…  So, starting with the good things: 1)    Although the room was tiny and had not much extras in it (like tee / coffee maker, glasses etc.) the staff was very friendly and helpful and brought everything at the request (and no extra cost). Thus, my suggestion is if you stay there and feel that something is missing, just ask :) 2)    Central location. Some might like it, others might hate it, but I would place being in the centre of Manhattan as a positive; 3)    The history of the hotel. They have a long and rich history that they’re proud of. And they have a small, but interesting exhibition downstairs dedicated to that; 4)    Room, although had seen better days,";3
We have stayed in The New Yorker a few times now. The first time we stayed in the metro room with 2 queen beds. Quite small and brown decor. Bathroom was tiny with a shower/bath that leaked everywhere.this was about 9 years ago so i think a lot of the rooms have been refurbed since then the other 2 occasions we stayed in suites- the extra room is a bonus but not necessary.....you're in NYC after all, who wants to spends all their time in the hotel room?! Suite would be good if you have a 3rd person who wants their own room (roll out sofa), or like us you were getting married and needed the room for all the preening that takes place :) Overall it is a good hotel is a great location. Sure it's a little worn but it is a good price. If you join the rewards scheme you can get points;4
"Was bitten by bed bugs on first night.  Having not experienced this before, didn't realize what it was until return trip home.  The room we received was very small and dirty with tissues and used bandages left on the floor from the previous guest; seems that there were 50+ years of dirt and cigarette smoke accumulated in the carpet and crevices, that no amount of vacuuming would eliminate.  Requested that Housekeeping clean room after first night and she stripped all bedding, explaining that room had not been properly cleaned or prepared following last guest's stay. We booked through a discount hotel site and upon check-in were told that a resort fee would be charged.  $145 for a 3 night stay to cover Wi-Fi, phone and fitness center access, in addition to our $695 prepaid cost";1
This hotel is conveniently located in the middle of Manhattan.  It is very close to Penn Station so if you are arriving by train, you can save the cab fare and walk the one block to the hotel.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.  If your room is not ready, they will store your bags for free.  At the end of your trip after checking out, there is a $2.00 fee per bag to store them.  The rooms are small, but so are most rooms in NYC.  The bathroom sinks are ridiculously shallow so be careful not to get splashed when you turn on the water.  There are no room refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms or lobby and no complimentary breakfast, but the room rate was fairly reasonable for Manhattan.  There are plenty of dining options near the hotel.  The location is within a mile;4
Hotel is in a great location and the rooms were fine as we didn't spend much time in them apart from sleeping.  Staff are really nice and the concierges were very pleasant and helpful. We ate in both the restaurant and the diner and food was excellent.;4
Krystal was so helpful at the front desk..i explained how I wanted to propose to my girlfriend and she made sure I had a room with a view..she made my stay I should say our stay so memorable...thank you krystal..and the hotel is so clean and beaitiful..we loved it..                   Thank you                Allan D;5
Art Deco style hotel in a great location right by penn station. I have no doubt that, in its day, this hotel was magnificent, sadly that day has passed and it is looking a bit tatty and unloved. On the plus side, the fitness centre is large and well equipped and staff seem friendly and helpful. My room was small but comfortable, fairly standard for manhattan. Unfortunately the bathroom was just filthy. Hairs around toilet and sink and a strong smell of urine, disgusting.  In summary, a shabby establishment trading on its location.;3
But hardly a 4-star hotel! The lobby was large and spacious--and filled with tour groups. The staff was lovely and very helpful. But the room was tiny. If you were sitting at the desk, the person in the bed could not get past you to get to the bathroom. The closet was tiny as well--and very shallow. Because there was a safe in the closet, it was almost impossible to hang up clothes. We would stay again only because of the location but this was clearly a 3 star hotel, not a 4 star.;3
Arrived in the evening and the room was not available. After more than 1 hour was not ready yet. Finally got the room, but it was a room for 1 person instead of 2. There was only one set of towels and although asked at the reception the additional towel, it was not delivered. We also had cold water and we had to change room again. It was the worst experience in a hotel i ever had.;1
We stayed here first in 2015. I always said I would never stay in the same place twice, but it was so good it was a no brainier! The perfect location in Midtown-easy to get to the subway, bus station, Madison Square Gardens, and obviously Macy's! We had an incredible view of the Empire State Building from our room, and requested similar for our second stay.... it was even better! The staff are great, and with 24hr security you always feel safe and cared for. Will be staying there again fir our biannual girly shopping trip.;5
We stayed here with a group - we had about 15 rooms and they were all great. All were well appointed. Some were on the small side, others were a little roomy and had 2 closets and 2 bathrooms! They was such a pleasant surprise - especially in an old hotel! There are rooms with great views of the Empire State Building as well (though most don't have these - many of us had views into each other's rooms!) There is a good diner, the Tick Tock, on site, or a coffee cart in the corner of the lobby if you want to grab something and go. There are plenty of restaurants and drugstores within steps of the hotel for convenience. And Penn Station and the subway are across the street to get you to anywhere you want! Plus the Theatre District, Times Square and the Empire State Building are all;4
We had a wonderful friends weekend at the New Yorker. Our room was great with a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. Staff was friendly and helpful and the Tick Tock Diner was always open for a quick meal or snack. Very convenient location, great for those traveling by train. Would love to go back!;5
Stayed there with my husband for 6 nights.  We checked in early and was happy that they had a room ready for us.  Great location as it is just across the street from Penn station and within walking distance from Broadway.  Was disappointed that the breakfast special they had was only available on-line and that we could not use it anymore after we have checked in. (I saw it on their website and thought that I would organize it when we arrived at the hotel.  Unfortunately did not work out like that so we did not have breakfast at the hotel at all.) The queen room that we had was very small, but comfortable enough.  Good bed.  The bathroom was also very small and had very little space to pack out anything. The big shock came when we checked out.  We received a invoice for daily;3
The location is a definite plus as is the really pleasant staff. If you can get a good rate online somewhere it is definitely worth staying here. Extremely convenient for buses coming into the city from D.C. or Penn Station or Port Authority. All the West Side subway lines are within a block walk and you can get basically anywhere in Manhattan within a short time. I actually ended up staying in two different rooms as my first room smelled horribly of cigarette smoke and they had to move me. The decor of both rooms was the same so it doesn't make that much difference what room you are in. Because it is such a big place and caters to many tourists I understand it is hard to enforce the no smoking rule so I would suggest if your room smells smoky asked to be moved immediately!;4
This was a great spot to stay. My son and I traveled to see a couple of Rangers games and the location of the hotel, across the road from MSG was perfect. It is also perfectly located to visit Times Square, the Empire State Building and Central Park. Our room was a tad small considering the price, but we didn't spend a lot of time there as we were on the go most of our trip. Very friendly and accommodating staff. We were scheduled to arrive around 3 but ended up there at 1. They found us a room right away and booked us in without charging an early check in fee. Room was small but very clean. The bathroom had an older style tub but everything worked perfectly and again was very clean. A top notch experience!;4
If you like artDeco style, this your hotel. I'm a big fan of artDeco so this is one of the many reasons we chose this hotel. Location is perfect (Penn station 8th ave. and 34th st). Rooms are a bit small but you have to keep in mind, this is an old hotel from the early 30s. The fitness room is filled with modern equipment and water. Walking distance to Empire State Building and Macy's.;4
The hotel is located in a strategic location near penn station so if you are using the trains it's pretty good. other than that it's not the best part of town... you are bound to run into some funny characters all around you.  We had a double queen bed room which was pretty spacey. The room is VERY uncomfortable - there is no light in the closet room (although it is nice to have one, but it has no shelves, so it's basically just a suitcase hideout). and there are no shelves in the bathroom... you got nowhere to put your toothbrushes or whatever. The shower head in the bathroom is something you might use to clean your car with.   it really feels like the hotel is putting patches on anything that breaks instead of really giving a decent fix.  We stayed on the 36th floor and had;3
Me and my wife came from israel and stayed for 5 nights in the hotel. Wonderfull location, very nice staff. I want to say a good word for the bell captain joe that treat us like family, such a nice person, helped us wlin everything we needed.  With staff like joe iam sure going to stay again at this hotel.;5
this location was great ! ( 8th avenue and 34th st) if you are doing anything midtown. we got off the train at penn central and only had to walk 2 blocks to get to hotel. we visited a lot of fabric stores that were on 37th -39th street and it was an easy walk. we also went to the theater at night and were able to walk there too. the hotel was clean and friendly. very small bathrooms!;4
Love this hotel for many reasons but most importantly it is across the street from Penn Station and can take the train from CT. to NYC and walk to the hotel. Very comfortable beds, rooms and location at reasonable price.  Walking distance to theatre district, Times Square, Empire State Building, etc.  The Tick-Tock Diner attached to the hotel is great for breakfast/lunch or late night munchies.  The second restaurant in the hotel is the Trattoria-Bianca and is bit more upscale and great for happy hour drinks and appetizers and dinner.  The staff at the hotel is very accommodating and always very pleasant. We have been upgraded a couple of times to rooms with views of the Empire State Building which was great.  I highly recommend this hotel and would remind everyone to remember;5
We spent five nights in the New Yorker to celebrate my husbands 70th birthday. We got a free upgrade to a city view room which was so special. You feel so close to the Empire State Building. Lovely to lie in bed and look at the city lights. Friendly efficient staff. Tick Tock Diner good for breakfast. Only down side was we paid for private SUV transfer to the airport but were put in a shuttle bus with another family. Felt ripped off. $150 .;4
We stopped here for 4 nights in January - the location is fantastic - a 5 minute walk from times square and broadway - 5 minute walk to Empire state building - Macy's on your doorstep and maddison square gardens right outside the hotel . Every taxi driver knows where the hotel is aswell which is great . Their is a dinner right underneath the hotel it was lovely and reasonably priced didnt  look much from the outside but it is nice to eat in we eat here 3 out of the 4 days for breakfast . We went on the empire state building excursion their is loads of men stood outside trying to sell you tickets we nearly fell for this but just keep walking and their is an official ticket office just beside the boats . Hotel is dated but its cleaned daily and you are never in your rooms so it;5
We stayed in the New Yorker from 22/4/17 for 4 nights, it was a great location and very central. The staff were lovely, the room was clean. Overall it was a perfect location to stay. There is a restaurant and Diner in the hotel we ate at both and food was very good.;5
I reserved 2 nights recently *and prepaid* so that after arriving via red-eye in NY at 7am, I would get to hotel at 8am and sleep 3 hours before my noon meeting.  I called the day ahead to ensure there was a room for me when I arrived at 8.  When I arrived ... no room.  They said 30 minutes, but it was more like an hour, to get a single room clean enough for me to sleep.  They did eventually comp me the night, but only after I made a fuss -- the default was I just had no room when I got there.;1
This property is amazing and check-in was great as well.  My only issue is that I didn't automatically receive my Diamond Member benefits.  I had to mention it at check-in.  Other than that my stay was great.;5
We stayed at the New Yorker in late February, we got very lucky with amazing weather.  The hotel is in a perfect spot within walking distance of Penn Station.  Everything was smooth at check in, the rooms are average but comfortable and the majority of the staff was helpful, with the exception of a grumpy lady at the concierge desk.  This in the hotel are a little pricey but you have all the options near by for coffee, food and whatever else you need.  It really is about location, location, location.  We only had a day and a half to explore and being near many of the major highlights gave us the chance to do it all.  We look forward to staying here again in the future.;4
Love this hotel. Very reasonable as NY goes and has been refurbished.  Just checked in today.  Exhausted after an overseas flight and Mohammed was so accommodating for us.  He searched and found a room we could get right away.  Front desk staff going the extra mile in NY is rare.;5
Stayed for 3 nights for a conference held in this hotel in April. I had a conference discount for my room. Maybe for this reason, my room is concise. No coffee machine, no water. The washroom is small. But still OK, you don't stay inside when you are in downtown New York. It's within walking distance (10 min) to broadway.;3
There is so much to love about The New Yorker! From its location to the Tick Tok diner to the quality of their rooms - this is one of our favourite places to stay in NY.   It is so easy to get around in NY using the New Yorker as your base. Either walking or taking the subway is a breeze. I especially like how close this is to the High Line.;4
Hotel was a decent choice. Location is excellent and close to Penn Station. Price was low and room was as you would expect for that. Not the cleanest and not the best, but fine for the cost. Staff was not as friendly as you would expect.;3
Where to start from?! :-) We spent 10 days in NYC @ The New Yorker, and was the best decision we've made.  The location is the best in the city - close to subway, also perfect for walking! You have so many choices for food and fun around. The rooms are not small at all - it was the best bed we've ever slept, comfortable, clean and the most important the view from the room - priceless! We loved waking up here with the Empire state building in front of us. All the employees are super kind and sweet.  One is for sure, if we come back to NYC we would definitely come back at the New Yorker!;5
We came to this hotel because it was in Manhattan and we got it cheap on a deal. We expected nothing but a roof over our heads and got so much more. First, the location is superb, right by Penn Station, and walking distance to so much. Second, we loved the mini basement museum, which gave us a great sense of the surprising and illustrious history of the hotel. Our room as as cheap as possible, and small. We could not really fit both of us in the bathroom at the same time. But for the price and location, who cared! The breakfast diner got us going every morning, with immense choice (even healthy choices) and great service. There is also a restaurant right in the hotel that was excellent, and the prices were reasonable. Finally, there was a pizza joint right across the road that;5
Very clean. Quiet. Old, but charming and very well maintained. Feels safe. Nice alarm clock with two USB connections and two grounded outlets for chargers, C-PAPs, etc.  Good access to touristy locations near midtown. Good casual 24 hour restaurant in lobby. Friendly staff. We were happy we made this selection.  Two minor things. Toilet was very low and close to side wall. And, gotta get past hard-sell of Wyndham property memberships to get to elevators to your room.;4
We recently stayed here on a family holiday the hotel is older but the service is great rooms are cleaned daily and although they are very small it doesn't matter to much as you don't spend much time in there. It is located 8 blocks from time square which is on 42nd street the hotel is on 8th avenue and 34th street which has near Madison Square Gardens and not to far from Macy's which is also on 34th street overall a little dated but great service.;5
We stayed in a one bedroom with a family of six. Two queen beds and a very comfortable pullout couch in the living room area. It was clean and spacious and they even left us complimentary water and soda in the mini fridge. Close to MSG/Penn Satation-LIRR and subways.;5
My daughter & I went to New York for spring break 2017 and stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel on 8th Avenue. The actual hotel looks nothing like the picture. We shared a room with 2 queen beds, only it was 2 double The room was the size of a shoe box, my daughter & I had to turn side ways to pass each other in the room, seriously. That was the smallest hotel room I've ever witness. I will never never stay at this hotel again. Everything was old and out dated. The shower was clogged, but maintenance did come and fix that But NO I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. After my daughter and I return home, The hotel charge my daughter credit card $39.00/night for some ridiculas charge that they never told us about before hand. We specifically asked at check-in and check-out;3
Good service.  Really bad, touristy location.  I guess that's not bad for the majority of the people choose to see most of the sights.  Midtown, to me, is extremely noisy, scummy and overcrowded.    Aside from the noise outside, while in my room, on a daily basis the neighbors above were literally stomping and slamming to the point where it would not relent and I would be woken up without being able to go back to sleep.  I called the front desk and respectfully stated that the noise was occurring.  A few minutes later a member of their security staff came to my room to verify this and went upstairs to handle the situation.  The noise was reduced.  The next day it continued and I didn't want to bother the staff anymore.  It may be the structure of the place as well, but I've;3
For the price you pay of almost $300 a night, you don't get much of a room. I originally booked a room with 2 double beds and it said it was 400 square feet. But when the Bon Jovi concert was postponed for a week, and it was Easter weekend,  they had no large rooms left so for almost the same price we got a room with only one bed and a foot of space on each side of the bed. They did not hide the fact that it was only 100 square feet. The bathroom is very small with a small sink that you cannot put anything on. There were 2 small tables with a small TV on the wall. No chair and no refrigerator. But if all you need is a bed and a shower you will be fine.  The people there were nice enough and security was good as you have to show your key to get on the elevators.  Just not worth;2
A really cool midtown hotel with a great buzz and an old time feel. One block form Macy's and a 1 minute walk from Penn station makes it a great base to explore the city from.   Like other reviewers, the add on costs when you're there are a bit on the cheeky side, but I suppose as long as you know that's coming and you've factored it in, it's not so bad.;4
I've stayed at the New Yorker a few times now and just wanted to write an updated review. Last year I stayed with my family so there were five of us in a suite on the 40th floor. It was room 4008, really lovely, plenty of room with a view of the Empire State Building. We were moved to this room from 2549 which was dark, smelly and had a tatty bathroom. As we booked again for this year, I e-mailed and requested the 40th floor again. However, once again we were given room 2549 which needs an upgrade...so we asked to be moved and once again , the lovely Krystle accommodated our request. The hotel moved us to 4006 which, for a family of five, was great and had that lovely view. Everything else was fine...the location, security, Tick Tick Diner, breakfast snack bar in the lobby that;4
We stayed here just for a change of pace while visiting our son who lives in NYC. We got a deal thru a 3rd party site & decided to explore the area. Macy's & many other stores easily walkable. The bar was OK, drinks were priced for midtown, but not up to standards. Tick-Tock diner was awesome! Pricey of course but the Nutella french toast was worth it. Staff were very friendly, elevators plenty & fast (yes this is a consideration if you've stayed in other places in Manhattan!) Wife & I are Big Band aficionados, so when we discovered the historic exhibits downstairs we were in heaven. We even snooped around to the ballrooms, 2nd floor mezzanine, etc. Some things have obviously changed since the hotels heyday, but it was neat to spot some of the old fixtures, hardware, etc. If;4
We stayed only for one night. We had booked a double room but, after a long journey, we asked to have a double/double.  Reception could not have been nicer and made no extra charge.  Not only very comfortable, but with a fantastic view! Altogether a very pleasant experience.  Major attractions are within walking distance, as is Penn Station.  Would not recommend the TickTock for breakfast - it was chaotic and expensive.;4
checked into the New Yorker April 17, 2017 (4 night stay) 2 adults and 2 teenagers.  We originally had the standard metro view double room.  We knew this room might be a challenge for us as it only has 2 double beds..1 TV and the bathroom.  (no desk or chair).  Upon check in we upgraded to the metro view suite..a little more costly, but well worth it.  the room now came with an extra sitting room with a pull out double sofa, another TV, desk/chair and mini fridge.  This suited our family of four much better.  The room was clean, and the view from window was wonderful!  out one window was the Empire State Building/Chrysler Building all lit up and from another window was Madison Square Garden.  The Hotel is located in the most perfect mid-town area!  Penn Station/ subways are;4
Hotel is undergoing renovations and not all areas were complete but you can tell they are working on it.. Our room was nice with an AMAZING view of the Empire State Building which puts on a light show at night with the peak constantly changing colors. We came in on a train to Penn Station and it literally was about an half a block away. Subway was right around the corner. The Tick Tock cafe was a neat 50's style diner that was attached to the hotel. Liked all the history they had on display in the basement. Staff was nice. We could walk or take a short cab ride to Time Square and Broadway. shows.;5
Myself and my husband stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and it was just what we wanted. It was close to all the major attractions like Madison Square Gardens, Empire State Building and of course Macy's!! Penn station was also right beside us and Times Square was within walking distance. Grand Central station was also within walking distance. The room we stayed in was small but had all the amenities you would expect in a hotel and rooms were spotless. Check in was pain free and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The tick tock diner was also a great addition and the food was fab. The only downside was the hotel put a hold of $45 on your card for every night you stay and didn't remove that hold for over 10 days on our card which didn't suit us as we were travelling on but;5
This is the worst hotel in this price bracket I've stayed in.   We booked a suite with a view.  Initial impressions - the room was a good size but quite run down and with a tiny bathroom (the cupboard in the room was bigger).  Second impression - loud noise from building works in the rooms directly underneath us.  We spent over 2 hours trying to change rooms - not what's needed after an international flight.   Reception staff told us on different occasions that no building works were scheduled (despite the fact that we could see workmen on the terrace below, and could hear loud drilling, banging and clanging).  We were then told that the building works had been stopped - they had not.   Staff ignored our questions about whether the works would carry on through our stay.   We;1
Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. It is superb for location to see all of New York's major sites. The hotel is very dated, I know it was the height of modern when it was built, however could do with a bit of a re vamp. The rooms are very small and the bathrooms are tiny. No tea/coffee facilities, clean though. Great as your only there to sleep as generally out all of the day and evening. The tick tick diner located within the hotel served good breakfasts,although very busy and waiting time was lengthy. Tiny bit pricey but it is New York. Staff helpful enough. Rooms were quiet as quite high up.;3
"I booked via an online agency. When I checked in, I was told that in addition to the advertised room rate, I would be required to pay an additional non-optional $29 per night ""facility fee"", to cover usage of the in-room telephone, the business center and the fitness center, even though I did not wish to make use of these facilities. When I subsequently checked the booking details, I did notice the fee buried in the fine print, but it was not prominently displayed when I booked. I would advise other travellers to check carefully before booking whether the hotel is going to levy this fee. As a result of this experience, I won't be returning to this hotel.";2
Overall my 2 night stay was fine. All the staff were friendly and helpful. My room in the 8th floor was small, but very clean. The bathroom is tiny. The vessel sink was shallow so water splashed on the floor and it was difficult to wash out my reusable water bottle. There is a shelf behind the toilet and sink. Unfortunately the toilet seat cover didn't stay up because of the shelf. Every time I used the toilet, the seat hit me in the back, that was annoying.;3
This hotel is located near the Empire State Building and just a few blocks away from the GO Bus stop, if arriving from DC.  Not too far from Times Sq. but far enough.  We enjoyed this location.  Our room had a fantastic view of the Empire State Building.  The room worked well for our family of 4 (1 tween and 1 teen).  We had enough room for a rollaway bed and the room had 2 closets which was great for storing all the luggage.  One closet was big enough to use as a private space to get dressed. The decor of the hotel is Art Deco which was really fun.  I am so glad they have not changed the 1929 decor.  The shower can be challenging (note: the top knobs control the shower).  The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean for a big NY hotel.  The beds were comfortable.  The;5
Our room was a decent size for the two of us and was cleaned every day. We had some difficulties at check in so Mohammed helped us out and gave us a free room upgrade. It was in an excellent location which had Penn station over the road and the local subway stops on each side of the building. MSG was across the road too and we were within walking distance of Times Square, 30 Rock and the Empire State Building.   The staff were so friendly and welcoming. But by far the best thing about this hotel is the fact that Tik Tok (diner) is directly underneath! We would 100% stay here again and look forward to!;4
Just returned from our second visit and stay at the New Yorker which tells a story in its own right .. Great location in the heart of Mid town close to Empire State Building , Madison Square Gardens , times sq ( ten min walk ) . We were given a great room overlooking the ESB and Madison SG. We did E mail ahead to ask for this . Room was nice , quite spacious which was a surprise based on previous visits to NYC. Only disappointment was the bathroom which was a little tired and in need of upgrading . Minor thing in the grand scheme of things . All staff were very helpful and we had no issues what so ever. The Tick Tock diner is a convenient eating place that serves 24 hours a day but better value and quality can be found within a couple of blocks walk. Not withstanding we ate;4
"There is no doubting that the hotel provides a brilliant location for sightseeing in New York; situated across the road from Madison Square Gardens and 5 mins away from the Empire State Building. However 'hidden' costs for basic essentials such as WiFi take the sheen off your stay. 95 dollars for 4 days' worth of WiFi is a pretty rough deal. The charge also covers international phonecalls, but then how useful this is to tourists on a sightseeing trip is a matter of opinion.   On top of this, a petty 2 dollar charge per item for left luggage on check-out isn't exactly accommodating, given the nightly charge for the room and the hotel's (inflated in my opinion) 4* status.   My wife and I have been fortunate enough to travel the world, and we have never come across such blatant";3
People on vacation in New York are always asked to be careful where they stay for the night. The New Yorker is a fine place to feel secure and enjoy.  Right across from Madison Square Garden  and on a direct walk or subway to Times Square, The New Yorker is my favorite place to stay without going for broke. Rooms are always respectfully done and clean.  Bigger than expected and staff are prompt and helpful.  I have stayed here a half a dozen times and each time I have been pleased.;4
The trip included myself and my hubby and it was a trip for our 40th and 50th birthdays as well as our 20th wedding anniversary. When we arrived we were upgraded to the executive room. It was lovely and the shower was fantastic but unfortunately we were looking out at a brick wall. I rang down about it and the receptionist offered to change our room the next day. We ended up declining because we were exhausted and had unpacked and didnt fancy packing and unpacking again. We also were sent up a bottle of champagne the next day after chasing it up. All was fine until St Patricks day when there was an unbelievable amount of noise as if a band was playing on the floor below us. I rang down and asked reception what was going on thinking it was a band for St Patricks day playing in;5
My husband and I stayed at the New Yorker on our honeymoon and we found the hotel to be in an absolutely brilliant location. The room was small but comfortable and the bathroom was a decent size. All could do with a referb but ultimately it was cozy and suited our needs well (although no tea / coffee making facilities which for a Brit abroad was startling!).   One thing to be aware of with this hotel is how tightly packed in the rooms are, therefore your neighbours sound like they're in the room with you. We had horrendously noisy neighbours on our first night (which to be fair, security came and spoke to) who didn't shut up until 5am.   After this, the hotel decided that their maintenance team needed to be in the next  room for the rest of our trip - the next 3 mornings had us;3
Ok so i think hotels in America lack the quality of standard we are used to in Europe and this is why i'd say this was more like a 3 star.  The reception area is pretty with the big chandelier etc but when you get up to the floors with the rooms you realize this needs major updating, even some paint would be good.  The receptionist told us he had given us a nice room?? it was pretty much of a brick wall was not a view, so not sure if he was joking or not.  The room was clean, beds comfy etc has a safe, tv etc.   The hotel is in a good location, could walk to see most sights. 10 mins from Time Square, close to Madison Sq Gardens.   Loved New York but next time i'd maybe try a different hotel :);3
Most obscenely small room I've ever seen. Travelled to NYC numerous times, and people always say rooms are small, but this place is next level small. Feels like you're in a college dorm, but without the RA and the booze.;2
Hotel is really really old, but well maintained.. i would say it's old-fashioned but very clean and in good conditions... the location in midtown is really good (for those who like the craziness in this area). if you prefer something quiter, choose something else (maybe not NYC). Service is good although i haven't asked for anything excepting the mail room, which has a very organised system to secure you'll get your packages in the right way... Room is not small but not so spacious... it's acceptable... restroom was very old-fashioned too, but well maintained and cleaned...;3
My family has just returned from a three night weekend in New York over Easter, staying at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel.  We'd booked a package with Travelbag but contacted the hotel direct in advance token them know that it's our wedding anniversary and they kindly gave us a dual aspect room with the most amazing view of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden - 3410. The view really took our breathe away!   The room itself was very comfortable. We had two double beds,  chair, desk and a walk in wardrobe, which also contained a safe and iron/ironing board.  As other people have mentioned, the bathroom is small but it was clean with lots of fresh towels and toiletries.   If you're arriving before 4pm - the official check in time - your room may not be ready, so just;5
Old  and stylish, good location, very friendly staff, clean, good for a rest but not work, rooms are small, a bid overpriced. Many spots in walking distance, close to the Subway, good Diners type restaurant.;4
Just returned from a 4 night stay. The hotel lobby was Art Deco & impressive but our room left a lot to be desired. We had a twin double bed on the 22nd floor. The room was tiny only just big enough for one double and not at all like the rooms pictured on their website, badly in need of renovation. There was also some outside work going on as there were ropes outside our window but we were out all day so it didn't bother us. Should really have complained & asked to be moved but I'm not one to cause a fuss.  It was easy to get around from there, one block from Penn Station and 10 minute walk to Times Square.;2
Hotel located in the heart of NYC.  Friendly and accommodating staff who went above and beyond in assisting us with navigating NYC.  Recommendations on dining were excellent.  Security was right on top of things ensuring that our safety was their #1 priority.  Room was very clean and comfortable and surprisingly quiet for being in the heart of NYC.  We were a 15 minute walk to Times Square and all the theaters in NYC.  Enjoyable stay!;5
Stayed her for four nights 11-15 April.   The hotel was perfect for what we wanted.  Location is fantastic, only minutes away from Times Square, Macy's etc.  Over the road from Penn Station.  It was my friends 50th birthday celebrations, and we notified the hotel prior to travelling, and we were all upgraded to larger metro rooms free of charge, with fantastic views of the Empire State Building.  The hotel was extremely busy, and often had long queues at reception to check in and check out, but was never waiting too long.  There were also queues for the lifts at peak times, but again never had to wait more than a few minutes.  The rooms were quite small, but only what you would expect from a city hotel.  They were also extremely clean and the maids came every day and made the;4
Very good location just across Pennsylvania Station/MSG. The room was clean which was the most important to us. We had some trouble with noise from the street during the night, but I guess you should expect that in the heart of Manhattan.;4
Make sure you are a Wyndham Member. They upgraded my room. I had two large beds, two closets, a safe, a small seating area with a table and two chairs, and a desk with a chair. The room was lovely. The bathroom large. There are 2 restaurants on premises. The security was reassuring. They have a doorman, a security guard behind a desk, and another one who checks room keys before you go upstairs. It is kitty corner to Madison Square Garden, a doable but long walk to Times Square and Broadway. A doable walk to Empire State Building.  The area is filled with fantastic  affordable places to eat. There are these adorable buffet restaurants with seating upstairs. Everything in it is delicious. Even the soups. We even picked up muffins and yogurt for our breakfast there. One of them was;4
We stayed here for 2 nights - the hotel was clean and the beds were very comfortable. We didn't have a view but there was no city noise even though we were on the 7th floor. We had a great nights sleep! Within walking distance to everything but if you want to take the subway it's right there. The staff was very nice - nothing to complain about except the $22 a night fee.;4
The location here is so perfect. There is an amazing rooftop patio bar on 34th st near 8th, it's close to Madison Square Gardens, a stumble away from empire state building, the subway, and close enough to time square that you could really just walk there. I would absolutely stay here again as no other place beats the value you get for the price you pay!;4
The Good: Location, location, location. The Challenges: The newly remodeled rooms (which we were told were on floor 7 & 8) were (we were told)150 sq ft.,  but seemed smaller. The closet was about 8 inches deep so shirts, jackets, etc. couldn't even fit except at an angle that prevented the closet door from shutting. Imagine a bathroom where you can't shut the door unless you lean up against the small sink! The hotel is under construction so we heard jack hammers through one of the 3 nights we were there - they didn't work over night on the weekend - but bring earplugs!  We also had problems with billing. While we did have 6 rooms (family) when it came to charging appropriately at the hotel, we had to go through several different clerks, at different times. We also experienced an;2
My husband and I stayed in the New Yorker for a four day stay with our two children (11 & 9), I was concerned the room would be too small but was pleasantly surprised there was plenty of room even with two queen sized beds in the room! Small bathroom but large bedroom area. Plenty of wardrobe/draw space. The lifts can get busy depending on what time you hit them! Tick Tock diner within hotel was also very good 😊  If it had tea & coffee facilities in the room would have been great but there is plenty of places to grab a coffee and take it back to your room!  NIce to have a safety deposit box in room without extra charge, also iron and full sized ironing board very useful.;5
I stayed here in 2011. This hotel is perfectley situated 5 minutes walk from Times Square. Central for everything. Rooms are lovely with everything you need. Nice comfy beds too with perfect after a long day site seeing. Would highly recommend.;5
"Everybody knows the building: we've all seen at least once a picture of the building with the ""New Yorker"" sign on its top.  The hotel is part of the mythical hotels; Nicola Tesla, Muhammad Ali, many other fight winners, actors, actress, politicians... stayed there. The ""art déco"" style of the hotel is interesting for the eyes, less for the stay because the it's a bit old. The view from above levels remains tremendous. Some rooms even faces the Empire State Building: we feel you can touch it. The hotel is really well placed: Penn station and the metro are across the street. And above all, it's less roaring than Times Square which remains few blocks away.";5
We stay for a week Our room was increadible small .The queen bed  looks even smaller we asked to upgrade the front desk informed us that there are not king beds in the hotel .The hotel needs immediate refurbishment .Room service is via a pizza restaurant and tic toc restaurant next to the lobby ...The only good was the location .Overvalued 100%;2
"My husband booked a weekend getaway for a concert at MSG so he chose The New Yorker based on location.  We arrived at 6pm on a Friday night and waited at the desk for 45 min to check in only to be told that the room type he booked was not available....at 6pm??  OK, so they gave us another room with two double beds as we had no time to wait around for the original room.  The room was clean, but beware, those ""double"" beds are tiny!  I'm 5'5 and my feet were at the end of the bed.  We were determined not to let it ruin our evening, but come on.  For what you pay for a hotel in NYC, there were other options which we will choose next time.";2
This hotel is really showing it's age. The check in lines are long and Mr. & Mrs Johnny didn't get the room type we reserved. Also the toilet leaked all over the floor whenever you flushed it. You could barely turn around in the bathroom. The coffee maker in the room didn't work properly. For what they charge, not worth it.;1
I reserved the executive suite. I was surprised to see it was very small but the upgrades done to the room and the look of the room was beautiful.  The staff were so very nice and really welcoming.;4
Just returned from a lovely stay at this hotel. The entrance lobby is wonderfully grand and really takes you back to another era. Reception staff were very helpful and friendly . Yes there was a queue but this is a huge hotel and to be expected I think.  Rooms are basic but very clean and serviced daily and again with a 1930s feel. We were on the 22nd floor and was quite noisy at night but nothing a set of earplugs can't solve. Tick Tock Diner was excellent . Had two evening meals and one breakfast there and both were super. Service excellent and always friendly . Also tried the Italian attached to the hotel which is not fast food and although more pricy (to be expected) the food was lovely, much more of a restaurant in every way. As for location , then this one is perfect for;4
A good night's sleep in a well appointed clean room. I like my shower to run a little hotter but I'm nit picking. I was on the 30th floor so noise was not a factor. I will happily return to The New Yorker.;5
The New Yorker is a good hotel in a great location. Next to a subway station, a block from Penn Station, and less than a mile from Times Square and the theater district. The price is a good value for the location. The rooms are small, but I didn't go to NYC to spend time in the hotel. Great fitness facility. Friendly staff. The art deco style of the hotel is a bonus, taking guests back to the hay day of the hotels glorious past. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting NYC.;5
This hotel is  a really good base  for sightseeing in New York, easy walking distance from Times square, Macy's hop on hop off bus routes. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean with very comfortable beds and excellent showers downside they were very small. The hotel suited our.  needs perfectly but if you are looking for a quiet hotel with a degree of luxury then this wont be for you, it is an incredibly busy hotel. We would like to return to New York and would definitely consider this hotel again.;3
"Clean enough. But the room was freezing--we couldn't get the windows closed, the shower was difficult to adjust between boiling or freezing, the check-out line was long and slow, and only 2 elevators seemed to be working from all floors above 20.   The location isn't bad; especially if you are arriving in Penn Station. But I wouldn't stay here again.";2
"I stayed her for almost a week for a trade show.  The shower was continuously blazing hot then freezing cold.  I had chalked it up to me getting ready at the same time as hundreds of other people...until I had to shower at 4am to catch a 7am flight.  Same horrific shower experience.  NEVER had one that was consistently the same temp.  Also very noisy.  When I was in the bathroom I could hear everything from the next door neighbors.  Also the in-room safe never worked.  Note they accept pets.  It was great because I got to ""meet"" the Westminster Dog Show winner!  But it was bad because I could hear the yip of the dogs on my floor well into the night.  Overall the room was a very good size for NY standards and you can walk to Javits from there, but I would not stay there again.";3
This is our favorite hotel to stay in when we go to NYC . It is a lovely hotel built in 1929, with some of the original murals and décor. It is extremely well located for travelers going to NYC for shows--we walked every day to and from the theaters. It is also a 10 minute walk from Times Square, and 20-25 minutes from MOMA, and 5th Ave. For longer city trips, the Penn Station/34th St. subway is just outside the door. There is a great 24 hour diner located right in the hotel which is reasonable priced and cozy. Rooms are not huge, but big enough, and the beds are VERY comfortable! Hotel staff are very helpful.;5
Thoroughly enjoyed our trip to NYC for my daughters surprise 18th Birthday gift.  The hotel upgraded our room free of charge as a birthday treat.  We had the most amazing view directly opposite the Empire State building on the 36th floor.  The hotel is in a fantastic central position to explore all the sites.  As others had recommended the Tick top diner, we tried it for ourselves.  The food was gorgeous and plentiful, the staff at the diner and the hotel couldn't do enough for us.  Would definitely recommend this hotel for sure!  Thank you to all staff, you did a fantastic job!!!;5
This hotel is in a brilliant location, situated on the opposite corner to Madison Sq Garden which was very handy and a very short walk to Times square. The Room we were given has a lot to be desired, I have shoe boxes bigger than the room we stayed in. We didn't even have enough room to have a case out and manoeuvre around it. The shower was ridiculous, you could not control the temperature so you either froze or you scalded yourself, so we then decided bathing was a better option, but the bath was the size of a sink and you had to bend your legs to sit in it. Housekeeping was on point and we did receive clean towels daily and had our room made up. The biggest bug bare of mine was the untold facility fee. This was a no option fee that you pay upon check out. They charge you;3
This was a very average hotel.  We have been travelling around the USA and this hotel was the most expensive and the worst that we have stayed in. We stayed four nights. I realise New York is expensive but this hotel was not value for money.  It is very old.  Our room had been recently painted and the bathroom tiles resprayed, but still needs work.  Carpet was grotty.  Room was small and although it was a queen room, the bed was not comfortable and seemed like a double bed, but that could be because it sank in the middle.  Bathroom was tiny with no bench space. There was no fridge or coffee maker, and worst of all, I found a dead roach in the room.  Hotel is extremely busy and was always a queue at the counters.  It was full of airline staff and tour groups.  We picked the hotel;3
Massive hotel we stayed on the 33rd floor, room was basic but clean & the bed was comfortable. Its true the city never sleeps, don't think ive ever heard so many sirens 24/7 in my life, fast food city not many GOOD places to eat but you can survive. If you like shopping you are in dream land Macys is about 6 storeys high & sell everything - so im told.;4
Good location - across the road from Penn station.  If you are a first time NYC visitor it's close to a lot.  Room I stayed in was very small and very dated. Walls were dirty. Whilst many rooms in NYC are small - this room was particularly so.;2
We caught a train at Baltimore airport and went straight through to Penn Station NYC. Walked out into a sunny New York afternoon crossed the street and walked in to the New Yorker. Old World charm at it's best. Greeted immediately by friendly staff, easy check in and straight up to our room. Lovely view over the city with Empire State and Madison Square Garden just outside the window. Perfect place to stay while in NYC with subway right below as well as Tic Toc diner for great meals and friendly staff. Easy to walk to attractions and Times Square. A special thank you to the lovely lady who cleaned rooms on our floor. She always greeted us every morning with a smile and a chat. Asked us what we were doing each day and was just lovely. I would recommend the New Yorker anytime and;5
First is location.  Hard to be better at the intersection of 34 th st and 8 th Avenue across from Pennsylvania Station. I used to visit this hotel with my parents 50 years ago. It dates back to 1929.  It has had a checkered career but now is under the Wyndham banner and things are looking good.  This is an Art Deco masterpiece. The museum and photo display in the downstairs lobby was a lot of fun. The rooms were comfortable though on the small side. The staff was extraordinary nice. At the time they had an extra facility fee which seemed to be added to all the bills to cover WiFi and exercise and business equipment. A bit odd, but we got a deal on price. . We had a very nice two days at the new New Yorker.  Never had to wait for an elevator. They have lots ... old style;4
The rooms need to be updated. The suite we had the shower kept going from hot to cold. I would suggest having another sink and a microwave in the suites.;4
The New Yorker Hotel embraces its art deco roots to provide an enjoyable holiday experience.  Located next to Penn Station, you can the train direct from Newark Airport (and some of the others) direct to Penn and then take the three minute walk to the Hotel's front door.  As NY hotels go it is priced reasonably, so expect the rooms to be on the smaller side.  Also watch out for additional room taxes and, as with most of the USA, sales tax added on to your bill on top of the menu prices.  The hotel rooms are currently being refurbished and we were lucky enough to get into one off the new rooms, which was decorated well with a modern art deco style.  We had views of the Chrysler Building, the East River and the Empire State.  There is a trattoria on the ground floor with a limited;4
We were a group of 4 friends who had planned our trip for over a year. I had been in frequent contact with the hotel to ensure our stay went perfectly ie making sure we had a fridge/coffee maker. I had booked a 42sqr mtr suite but when we checked in we were very disappointed to be given a much smaller suite which was way to small for 4 for a 5 night stay. After travelling for 12hrs all we wanted to do was wash & rest but i had to return to reception and stand again in the checkin line to try get it sorted. After quite a long discussion with the checkin member we were finally given the room i had booked.  This was the only issue we had with our stay, its a lovely big hotel with great security so we felt safe at all times, great house keeping & we needed maintenance for an issue;4
Great location, perfect for Macy's, Empire State Building, Maddison square garden and Times Square etc. We were on the 27th floor so had an amazing view too! Only bad thing I'd say is that the bathrooms were really in need of updating and the bath ran cold water. Would have appreciated tea and coffee making facilities being British instead of having to run over the road first thing in the morning to get coffee and also I've never stayed in a hotel where they charge you to store your luggage. Found that rather strange! All in all tho, great stay!;4
Very big hotel Pleasant staff and very friendly and customer facing Queue at checkin always very busy   Rooms very small and no fridge or coffee / tea making facilities available  Also next door washroom flushing boises can be heard as walls very thin...  Bathroom very small Also Shelf in bathroom so small I struggled to find somewhere to balance my make up bag....   Bedroom door not weighted so you really need to pull on door to close as it won't close by its self which could be a problem !   Generally nice hotel just very small rooms;3
This hotel has such a great New York feel to it and we loved it. When we checked in it was easy, we knew about the facility fee so paying by card was quick and simple to do, and nothing was too much trouble. When we got to the room it wasn't quite what was paid for, but Kristal (apologies if this isn't how you spell your name) changed it with no hassle, getting a member of staff to meet us on our floor with new card keys. I have to say this was a brilliant intro to our stay and it continued. The room was big, great views, clean and while some have mentioned needs updating, I loved the look and feel to the place. The location is great, near Madison Square garden, the metro station, and a 5 minute walk to Macy's. The adjoining Tick Tock diner was great. The doormen were very good;5
"We checked in on a Friday evening in April. Check-in was quick and valet parking was simple. The hotel is a very busy place.; always a crowd hustling in and out. We stayed in a standard room with a double bed. Our room was on the 35th floor. The room itself was tiny which is where the ""4/5 rating comes from. The bathroom does not have a counter or vanity making it difficult to store your toiletries and use a curling iron/ hair straightener. It took us a couple of minutes to find an outlet in the room. Once we moved a night stand we found one. I was surprised they didn't have them more accessible. There was no space to walk around the room which was fine as we didn't spend a lot of time in there. The view was incredible! The room itself was a bit outdated but absolutely spotless";4
We stayed on the 24th floor - the room was quite small, but was spotless and very comfortable. Bed excellent, shower excellent. The bathroom was very dated, but did its job as a bathroom! The lobby is beautiful, and plenty of lifts, and very safe and secure with staff checking for keys before you can access the lifts. Check in was ok - I found it hard to understand the lady at the desk, and she couldn't grasp the fact I wanted to pay cash instead of charging to a credit card (I told her I was maxed out) so instead, when my card was rejected for payment, I was left a message to contact the front desk. This was a bit embarrassing, even though I was expecting it - Here a lady named Laura, handled my cash payment with no problems at all - she was lovely. The hotel has 2 restaurants,;4
Bed room takes on a whole new meaning...tiny room.  Tiny bathroom...ok it is NYC, but it was the smallest room I have ever stayed at in the city.  That would have been ok, but the walls were so thin that I could hear the guy in the next room shave....at 4:30 am.  Never again...;2
I booked a suite for the weekend and was told if available I would be able to get 2 bathrooms. The front desk host told me the room was two bathrooms and it was not. She had me come back down, wait 3 hours, only to check me into another room with 1 bathroom. She had no idea which rooms had 1 bathroom or 2.  This hotel is unorganized and delayed my trip by 3-4 hours. I would of had a much better experience had they of known what rooms had 2 bathrooms and which did not. Renting a suite as big as we did would of been nice to have 2 bathrooms. Also, the hotel needs major updates. The double suite had a bathroom so small you could not physically fit 2 small girls in there. However there was a walk in closet? Use of space is poor and needs major updates.  Every time housekeeping;2
New York is an amazing place with so much diversity, with this being said the way we were treated by check in staff in particular Ornelia, I nor anyone I know will ever stay here again. This in NY and so many places to stay just because she was having a bad day she took it out on us. Very unprofessional and very surprised she is in the hospitality service. Will say Calvin was very nice. Bad experiences always stick and are far more shared.;1
"Second visit to this hotel and so glad I chose it. It's basically right across the street from Penn Station, so you walk out of the train and you're there. I was just up for a short weekend and found it super convenient. After I checked out I checked my bag with the bell captain and had a lovely day visiting museums and taking in a matinee, then walked the 10 blocks back from Times Square, picked up the bag and went right back to the train station.  The rooms are a decent size for NY, and the employees are very accommodating. My only complaint (and it's a very little one) is that the young woman who checked me in offered spontaneously to reduce the $29 ""resort fee"" to $10 since my stay was too short for me to actually use the facilities other than wifi. I thought that was very";4
I always enjoy this big city.  The hotel was incredibly busy.  The lobby was non-stop full of guest.  But, the employees always stopped to say hello and ask how we were doing.  They always acknowledged us.  Our room was typical small room but VERY clean and comfortable.  The noise was out of control, construction during the night.  But, there's nothing the hotel can do about it since it's going on in a different building.  We were in the 19th floor but we could still hear the rumble of the subway.   My children noticed all of these noises, but since I always travel to big cities it did not bother me.   I did not like the lobby restaurant.  The food was not that great and the prices are horrible.    Great great location.  I will definitely stay again!!;5
We booked last minute and were told the only rooms available were ones with double beds.  However, when we arrived, the woman behind the counter delighted us by saying we were getting a free upgrade to a suite!  The room was huge!  In addition to the bedroom, it had a separate room with a large closet, couch, television, and a Keurig setup.  It was very comfortable and spacious to hang out in.  The staff also provided us with an extra set of blankets, which I had requested for comfort.  We were very pleased with the room and service!  My only gripe is that the pillows were very thick, which caused me a great deal of neck pain (but that's because I have neck issues).  That aside, I would stay here again (while bringing a pillow from home!)!;4
The location of this hotel was very good and the view from the room was excellent. The hotel itself is a little old, with small rooms and no minibar in the room but overall it was a very enjoyable stay.;4
This is the second time in the last few months I have stayed at the New Yorker hotel - the first time on my own. The rooms do the job, as expected in New York they're small but space is limited. The decor feels a little aged and like a refurbishment wouldn't hurt them but there's nothing wrong with it, the rooms are all clean and the beds comfortable. The water pressure left a little to be desired and the fixed shower head could be a problem for taller people. The location is amazing, close to Pennsylvania Station to be able to get anywhere, also along 34th street you have lots of great shops, you're a short walk away from Times Square and all the Broadway shows. Unfortunately on this trip I ordered the romance package and received the chocolates when I went and asked why it;4
My husband and I stayed for 6 nights in July on the 34th floor. Rooms were small but fine for sleeping. Cleaning crew were fine and come around early so be sure to put out the DND sign if you can find one. Extra towels are a must and tips help you get them. Had rusty looking water twice come out of tap in bathroom so let it runall good before brushing teeth. Great Restaurant in hotel, and elevators are fast with not alot of waiting. Security guards are good and look for room keys almost all the time to gain entry on the elevators. Great view of MSG, and two minutes walk from Penn Station, and MSG. Take Subway system alot, and don't fall for someone trying to sell you a weeks pass to ride the subway for $3, as I fell for it and the first time I tried it the pass didn't work,;4
I like this hotel. Its old and well-worn, but clean, and everything seems to be working. Good old american style. The windows are far from soundproof though, and some constructionwork on the street kept me awake the whole night.   But I like the style of the hotel, and hope they will keep it that way.;3
My wife and I (26/27yo) stayed here for 4 nights at the end of March 2017 for our honeymoon. For the price we paid and that we were here for a special occasion, I expected a lot more.  The hotel is situated in a good location as you are able to walk to times square and there are plenty of restaurants located in the immediate area. It does however come with the traffic which is unavoidable so no complaints about that really.  We arrived on a Monday night and were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff. We requested a room with a view of the empire state building and they managed to accommodate this for us. They even brought a handwritten card congratulating us on our recent wedding.  The room we were in was situated on the 28th floor and like I said had a view of the empire;3
Stayed here for four nights with my family. My brother and my dad had a room, and me and my mum shared the other. Before we went we emailed the hotel regarding the scaffolding all around the outside of the hotel, they said it wouldn’t be a problem it would be gone, and as we were going to celebrate my dad’s 60th they would upgrade the rooms for us.  When we got there was no note on the system to say we should be upgraded, but the receptionist managed to find us two rooms that she could upgrade us too. We got two massive apartments but there was scaffolding when we looked out of our window which made the room all dark. We phoned downstairs and explained and the lady called back after 10 mins to say give her another ten mins she would sort it for us. We wanted to all be on the;4
The New Yorker has been renovated since my last stay and is lovely.  As a Wyndham Titanium Rewards Member,  I was upgraded to a  beautiful suite which was beautiful and very functional.  From check in to check out the staff was friendly and very helpful. I felt secure at all times and having the 24 hour Tic Tock Diner available was a wonderful asset for me.  This is a great hotel and I strongly recommend it to everyone. It's a little further from the Theater District than I usually stay, but it's well worth the extra cab rides.;5
Neida , at the reservations desk, has been amazing assisting us with knowledge about the New Yorker and the city's many attractions. She has gone beyond in providing us with the planning of our trip from transportation to popular sites to visit. So excited to write a review after the vacation. So far, so good!  Service =  A plus  -;5
Location was excellent. The room was very clean and bed very comfortable The staff were very friendly and helpful. We felt very safe. Tick tock diner and Italian restaurant attached to hotel were very convenient.;5
After several months of reading reviews, we choice this hotel for its location and the price.  What a great place for two ladies to spend a week in Manhattan.   The staff was extremely helpful an accommodating.  Rooms were really small but equipped with all amenities needed to make an enjoyable stay.  Room 3506 was decorated nicely and in a quiet location of hotel.   Tick Tock restaurant was a great place to eat a quick bite or have a meal.  Good food. Hotel is on corner and the E train (express) is on corner right outside the hotel and local trains are across the street.  Macy's is one block away, Madison Square Gardens is across the street. CVS Pharmacy is right across street.   I would def recommend this hotel for a value, safe and great location. Hope to see you again soon!;4
My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for her birthday trip to NYC.   The hotel is within close walking distance to great shopping such as Macy's at Herald Square, Victoria Secrets Mega Store and H&M and a shirt can ride to the theatre district in Time Square.  The hotel was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful.  The room was very small.  Love the ambiance of the hotel and will definitely stay there again.;4
The room was tiny, dated, smelled weird and there was LOTS of noise from outside which was obviously due to the fact that it was built a long time ago and didn't have much soundproofing. I got a great rate, though, so I guess it made up for it. When I say tiny, I mean there wasn't enough room in the bathroom for my toiletries and not really space to put them elsewhere in the room, either. You also couldn't open drawers in the mini dresser because the full sized bed was in the way. And there was barely even a place to put the ironing board! My entire floor had a musty smell to it that was clearly being attempted to be covered by air freshener. Note: You have to show your room key to get up to your room, so always be prepared to do so. The lobby is spectacular, which is quite;3
This hotel is in a GREAT location especially if you're coming by train from the Newark Airport, it's just a blocks walk away.  Hotel is iconic, rooms are clean and comfortable and we really enjoyed our stay!  We would definitely stay there again.;4
Came here for my birthday in November and wasn't disappointed. Whilst the rooms were on the small side and my bed was next to the window on a busy street, this didn't bother me at all (aided by the fact my window had a view of the Empire State). Everyone was very hospitable and everything was very clean, would definitely stay here again if I go to New York in the future.;4
I was in NYC with girlfriends and we had 3 rooms at The New Yorker:  One suite and two double rooms.  All were on upper floors.  Check in was very easy and we were able to access our suite upon check-in even though we were early.  The lobby is nice, but the halls when you come off the elevator are in need of update (new carpet and paint would go a long way to improve).  Our suite was a good size with three closets, pull out sofa, chair, small fridge, and sink.  No microwave or coffee maker.  The bathroom was small but sufficient. The bedroom had 2 double beds (not queen - but we knew that when we booked).  There was not much dresser space but we weren't in need since we were only staying 2 nights.  The double rooms were both on the same floor and each had 2 double beds.  The;4
Wonderful room, Great hotel location.  Staff was extremely attentive.  The decor was calming.  Clean and well kept.  This is a hotel I would stay at again.  Even the elevators were a great experience.  I would even bring my wife here and she is hard to please.;5
I came to town for New York Comic Con, and chose the New Yorker because it's a short walk from the Javits Center. It's also right across the street from MSG and there is access to just about any subway line you could need. The hotel has all the standard amenities, and as a bonus there's a Nikola Tesla exhibit in the basement. If you're diligent, you can also find the room where Tesla died, marked by a plaque. That was neat.  That said, I booked a suite for extra square footage and I'm glad I did because the room was positively tiny. There was barely enough room in the bathroom to get past the door that opened inward and then shut the door, as the door bumped up against the toilet. The sink barely had enough vanity space for toothpaste. The bedroom area of the suite had about one;4
Stayed here last week for 4 nights this hotel is perfect location for times square and Empire states building. lovely welcome at hotel booked in and was in the room after five minutes. Great bath in the room this was used after walking around all day. We could here sirens outside quite often but to be honest this didnt bother us one bit. Both myself and my friend slept straight through it. The tick tock dinner attached to the hotel is perfect, the food is amazing massive portions and very quick service. If you want a central hotel that all you are going to do is sleep in this is a perfect.  in New york its all about location and this is 100% perfect for that. when i return to New York i will stop here and recomend to friends also.;5
Daughter's choice ! As she is into retro this retro that this was Amelia's first choice Amazing building ! Rooms spacious very clean also  loverly and warm ! Shame restaurant is a diner but not to worry breakfast was good also lots of eateries in the area;4
Booked this hotel at the last minute  The good: - Location is great! (opposite Madison Square Garden) - Beautiful old Art Deco building - Proffesional attaentive staff - Very clean (beds, bathroom etc) - VERY GOOD value (I paid $125 for the night!!!) - Free wifi and free long distance calling (including international)  The bad: - Room was TINY (<150sqft) - Hotel is old and needs a makeover  - Hallways need new paint and carpet - Bathrooms work but have very old fittings  My PET PEEVE: Most hotels toda have EITHER a coffee maker in your room OR complimentary coffee in the lobby.  This hotel had NEITHE. I want my coffee!!;3
Booked this hotel via Hotel.com as I was looking for a 4 star centrally located. This is NOT a 4 star hotel. We were very disappointed when we got there. The room and bathroom needed urgent updating. The carpets are tired and wore, the bathroom had mold and cracked tiles. We didn't feel comfortable or clean at all. The corridors are dark and feel dirty. And on top of the all of this there is a compulsory charge of $29.00/night for the use of the Gym, Business Centre and Wifi. Looking at the guests I would assume that most of the guests were tourists so why do we need to pay for a business center and gym if we don't use it?? This is probably the worst review I have ever written on TripAdvisor.;1
Here for 4days to celebrate husbands 50th birthday. Love the Hotel, prime location and friendly service. Room of a good size & spotlessly clean. That and Tick Tock diner & stylish Bar on ground floor make for a perfect choice.;5
"On line it looked like they refurbished room.  Nope, 2120 is not at all refurbished.  The construction noise outside ALL night kept me awake. One of my biggest meetings in my career and I can barely function due to NO sleep. Our Company has 100s of people traveling and this property will be marked with do not stay. I asked from desk for a move to a refurbished room and I would pay more, ""sorry sold out""... Never again, DO NOT stay here. My great NYC view...";2
This hotel has become my home when I visit New York City.. I booked a standard king room.. when I checked in they had upgraded me to a beautiful suite on the 38th floor with an outside patio with a full view of NYC.. Perfect location.. Special thanks to Laura and Gabina from the front desk..great customer service.. Can't wait to go back next month for my next visit.. This hotel is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;5
Perfect and convenient location to Penn Station, Madison Square and Macy's and restaurant galore. The rooms were very clean.  Lovely view from the 23rd floor. Friendly staff. Breakfast selections were very good. Happy hour next door was nice and relaxing with low prices for drinks and appetizers. Will go back again;5
Stayed here for a week with my daughter to celebrate my 50th. On checkin we were upgraded to a better room after my daughter contacted the hotel to let them know it was my birthday during the visit. The rooms are small but only to be expected in a city centre hotel, the room (859) was perfect and had everything we needed including a comfortable bed (much needed after all the sightseeing). The staff were all very friendly and helped us whenever we needed it. The housekeeping staff kept the room immaculately clean. Located on 38th and 8th it's perfectly located for all your sightseeing. I have no complaints and would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC.;5
Great midtown location and low rate is tempting, but it is almost midnight and jackhammers are still blazing away here on full blast and I'm on the 25th floor.  Rooms small, dated with sub par amenities.....and bathroom not adequately clean.  Poor check in service with a bad attitude.  Not to even a mediocre standard, just say no.;2
We stayed here for 3 nights prior to a cruise, location is spot on. Across the road from Penn station and Madison square again, next to a subway entrance. Unfortunately it's next to Macy's so the cards took a hammering thanks to my better half. The food in both the diner and trattoria attached to the hotel is very good,it is expensive but that's New York for you. Room was clean and comfortable,had a view of the Hudson River, which was a bonus. Staff were very efficient and friendly, would use again.;4
"The hotel is situated just down from Madison Square Garden, opposite Penn Station, and a couple blocks from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Times Square, Macy's and the Empire State. All are easily within walking distance from here.    The interior of the hotel is beautiful; from the 1930s in the Art Deco style and really well preserved from that time. Rooms at the front of the hotel have a great view of the Empire State and Chrysler Building. The sunrise has to be seen.    The food on site is good; there's a diner serving American classics that's open 24/7 and a bar on site.   Only issue is the bathroom was a little cramped but for the age of the hotel was in a nice condition; nothing was broken and the shower is reasonably powerful.   I've stayed here twice now and would";5
The hotel is in a great location, surrounded by stores, restaurants and entertainment. This hotel was a very nice surprise.  Though the exterior is being renovated (seems like most of the city is under repair), the interior is quite lovely - art deco style - very well preserved and maintained from the 1930's. Our room was updated, clean and very comfortable.  The only negative is the bathroom was rather small.  Also very convenient is a diner with an entrance from the hotel lobby. We found the staff to be helpful and friendly.  As a Wyndham Rewards member I was quite pleased with this hotel and would definitely return.;4
We stayed at the New Yorker when we visited NYC for an event at Madison Square Garden, which is just a block away from the hotel.  Check-in was easy, the staff helpful and attentive and we liked having the Tick Tock Diner right in the building.  The room was typical NYC small, and not an elegant room, but it met our needs.  For example, the bathroom woodwork was chipped and the tile covering in the tub was old, but everything functioned well.  It could have been better cosmetically, but didn't affect our stay.  Overall, the decor was nice - retro design throughout the building, and very comfortable.  I liked that there was always someone checking to see that everyone had a room card/key before they could enter an elevator, so the security was visible daily.  We also took some;4
Chose for convenience to MSG and large discount.  Didn't plan to spend much time in room. Very clean well appointed, with single queen. Very comfortable.  Bathroom a little spare, old style slim tub , with single towel bar and single glass shelf - no countertop - that wasn't large enough for dop kit. Not sure couple would have been satisfied but that may be why they assigned it to single person.  Breakfast in their 24/7 diner efficient but TexMex omelet was fairly tasteless.;4
The room was small and the window looked out onto other rooms. It was also a little dated. But those small negatives were more than offset by the (relatively) inexpensive price and cleanliness. All the staff were friendly and helpful also. It's also a good location next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station.;5
Right in the heart of NYC. Most of what we did was within easy walking distance.  It was fun and exciting stay for the entire family. Staff were attentive to our very need;3
First of all the gripes ... there were hair in the bathroom ,building work was noisy and blocked view .  This aside was a great hotel , we said about the hair and the staff sent cleaners straight away .  The building work is just building work and can't really be helped , but maybe a discount for the disruption would be fairer than jus expecting guests to put up without knowledge,   Good location . Sizeable room , good water pressure ( we were on top floor );4
Stayed for 2 nights at this hotel at the end of my 3-month RTW trip. I've been previously to NYC many times and stayed in different hotels but this one is my favourite. I chose it because, being from Croatia, wanted to stay in the place where famous scientist Nikola Tesla stayed for the last 10 years of his life (1933-1943). He was btw born in Croatia. The room in question is 3327 and his study was 3328. I asked at the reception if I might be allowed to enter briefly the room. Not only I was granted that but the lovely receptionist upgraded me free of charge to spend the night in 3327! Great ending of my RTW trip! Thank you so much! The location of this hotel is superb - you are walking distance from the Penn Station, Empire State Building, Times Sq..., and short subway ride;5
We stayed at The New Yorker this week for just one night. It certainly isn't a 4 stars in the sense of a almost luxury hotel (in a scale of 1 to 5). However, the staff was super friendly, location was perfect for us - coming by train is a 3 min walk from the Penn Station and close to everywhere we wanted to go in Manhattan.  Room was small, but very comfortable- bed felt like a cloud, shower was nice and warm and everything was clean.  All the above yelds a 4 star on our book (again, we are not judging on luxury, but services and comfort).  We recommend it if you are on a budget and need somewhere clean, cozy and friendly to stay.;4
Spent 4 nights here after a week in Vegas. This was our second visit here third in NYC. Emailed prior to arrival to say it was a special occasion and got a new room on 7th floor. View not too good but cracking new room well equipped and great maid service.  Check in smooth and the hotel is well placed for all attractions. Was there for my birthday on st Patrick's day and had birthday cards held there for me sent from uk no problems. In summary in my opinion one of the best placed best value hotels in NYC;5
My wife and I were here for three days and will definitely be back next time we are in new York. We flew over from Ireland for st. Patrick's day. Got an upgraded room because it was our honey moon to a fantastic room with an excellent view. Hotel staff were so friendly and helpful especially John who worked at the guest relations desk one of the nicest men I have ever met. He sorted us out with all we needed even got us a taxi when we were leaving and personally carried our bags out for us. Would Definitely recommend this hotel for a visit.;5
"Summary/TL;DR - Hotel is located in a nice part of New York with access to transport and cafes, had a nice room with limited views and for the most part the staff are friendly. Hotel does look slightly dated on the inside and elevators can get pretty busy at times.  Note: I was travelling by myself. Reviewed the site based on the Hotel, Location and Service.  Hotel: To be perfectly honest, there isnt anything particularly special about the hotel, nothing that makes me feel like i would be in any rush to go back - saying that, there was were several positives. The room i was staying in was pretty nice: had a comfy bed, a safe, desk and a decent shower too. I had a ""Metro View Room"" although my view consisted of another building, but i could see the OWTC in the reflection of the";3
I chose this hotel because it was inexpensive on Hotel Tonight, near the Megabus stops, very convenient for subway use, and also in a well lit/high traffic area (I typically prefer quieter streets in Chelsea but was traveling alone so wanted to be a little more cautious). I came in the day after last week's snowstorm and was really happy that I was able to check in 2 hours early. My room was small but just right and comfortable for me. It was on the corner of the 20th floor and I had a nice view. The bathroom hasn't been upgraded yet but it was clean so that was enough for me. However the bathroom window is incredibly drafty and until I thought to close the bathroom door, my room was pretty chilly. Also the hallways could stand to be a little better lit/brightened up.  The only;4
The beds here seemed small to me, I questioned the front desk as to why the queen bed seemed smaller than the one I have at home and if I got the room I paid for. To make me happy they were nice enough to upgrade me from a simple cheap queen bed room to a two room, two bathroom suite with a walk out balcony that had views of MSG and the empire state building. The room was a little rough around the edges, but that's ok it's an old building in new york city. The bed was still equally smaller than I expected. But the customer service and the view were great for the price.;4
I  mistakingly forgot to confirm but the manager was able to accomodate my needsfor my daughter's 12th birthday sleepover that we were having at the hotel.;5
At first glance, the place looks very impressive with it's beautiful art-deco designed lobby. However, it goes a bit downhill from there.  The room was clean and big enough, with comfortable beds. However, there was no minibar or fridge, either of which would be considered a basic amenity in hotel rooms around the world. There was only one small window in the corner of the room, which meant that there was little natural light (although we had a great view of the Empire State Building).   The room was unfortunately not sound-proofed, and we were awoken early every morning by the cleaners and other guests talking very loudly in the corridor.  The corridors are very dark and dank. They look like they haven't been changed since the hotel first opened it's doors. They really need to;3
We loved our stay. The hotel is so close to Penn Station. It makes traveling easier. The proximity to shopping and restaurants was wonderful. We walked everywhere. The only thing that was missing was a way to warm food. We would have appreciated a microwave either in the room or have one available to us. We didn't want to go out for every meal as we were tired some of the time.;4
We reserved a suite with a pullout sofa. The room had a small refrigerator, single unit coffee maker and utility sink. The hotel is close to Madison Square Gardens, Empire State Building, Times Square, Broadway and a short walk to Madison Ave. The CTA is also nearby. The doorman are very helpful with transportation questions. There are restaurants attached to the hotel with many others within walking distance. The security was good and the rooms clean! We stayed on the 40th floor and had a view of the city with the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty in the distance.;5
I stayed here in March 2017, the hotel is nice and I booked my room for a very good price. It is a 15 min walk to Times Square, but it is close to some shopping districts. The hotel is very busy, but the service is very good and when I asked for something, it was delivered to my room right away. The room was clean but a bit small. I was staying alone and I was able to manage though. Coffee machine available upon request as well as refrigerators (my room wouldn't have taken a refrigerator anyway). The bathroom was also small and a bit outdated. I don't recommend Tick Tock diner at all. Over all, it was a nice stay in this classic hotel, will definitely stay here again.;4
Absolutely great location very central, needs more than a lick of paint. Reminds me slightly of the Tower of terror at Disney. If you're getting a good price then stay here, staff are friendly, just really could do with a full make over.;3
Me and my mum stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights. There was numerous problems with this hotel from check in to check out. We had issues with check in, regarding a pre arranged upgrade. This was dealt with to some extent by one of the guest service managers. As many others say on here, the rooms are small and the hotel is 1930s so a lot is still the original fittings, however the room was in need of a refurbish  especially the windows which let in a draft, and the curtains or drapes had to be closed to prevent the cold draft from getting into the room, and the heating turned up very high! We kept getting electric shocks of nearly every piece of furniture, from the towel rail in the bathroom, to the metal trim on the table. This was a real nuisance as you had to carefully tap;3
I selected The New Yorker because I had a Groupon for 2 for 1 nights and because it was very close to Penn Station.  Hotel is old but clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.  The location is great for walking to most places.  The restaurant on sight is good for breakfast.  I just wish it had been included in the price.  I would stay here again or recommend it to others.;3
We had  stayed at the New Yorker Hotel 3 yrs ago when we brought our family up  to celebrate our sons 13th Bd.  We were very happy then and again we weren't disappointed on our most recent visit to NYC. You can't beat the location of the New Yorker Hotel it's so centrally located! You have a 1 block walk to 34th street subway, 1-2 blocks away from Town Square and literally caddy corner to Madison Square Gardens. You are also  only a block away from Macy's or Kmart depending on which way you walk.  Not to mention you have the Tick Tock dinner that is open 24/7 as well as a pharmacy across the street that is also open 24/7 along with a CVS and McDonalds across the street.    The rooms are dated, bath rooms are small. But hey what do you expect from a hotel that's been around since;4
Central to all the attractions, front desk staff very good, helped us out when our flight got cancelled. Rooms are a little small and the room we stayed in could do to refreshed. Beds and pillows very comfortable.;4
"We love the New Yorker. We managed to stay in room 3328 which is the Tesla Study Room. There is a marker on the door along with the adjacent room 3327. There are also two posters of Tesla hung in the wall. This is an old hotel opened in 1930. The hotel was beautiful from the lobby to the rooms. As with most rooms in New York the rooms are small. We found ample room to dress and move around the room. The room was clean and had a great view out the windows. The shower was hot with strong water flow. There is a small history section below the lobby that shows some of the famous people that have stayed in the hotel. The only thing we didn't really like was the ""facilities fee"". They charged around $21 a night for use of the wifi and gym. The location and the history are wonderful";5
Went to NYC with my 19year old daughter. Hotel is in GREAT location. Price was great. Room was a little small, but clean and quiet. Safe neighborhood. Penn station 1 block away. Duncan Donuts across the street.;4
"The location at 34th&8th Ave Penn Station area gave very fast shuttle for me to and from LaGuardia, instant access to MTA Metro Bus and Subway transit system for quick travel over Manhattan and the other Burroughs. Short walk for shopping at Macy""s and other Department stores also walking distance of Times Square and almost all the Broadway theater district.. Many restaurants and fast food places in easy walking distance. The Hotel Security Staff is well staffed and provided, in my opinion , a safe environment.  Visiting the city alone 2 to 3 times a year on business I  feel this Hotel provides a very good value for me.";5
Arrived on a Saturday afternoon, the hotel was busy but the check in was friendly and quick. Allocated a room on the seventh floor, no view to speak of but I was not that bothered as I did not intend to spend that long in it. The room was well appointed and of a decent size, I was using the bed setee, it was very comfortable and i had a good nights sleep for the duration of my stay. I had one issue on the first night, the window pane rattled from the vibration caused by the aircon system, this disturbed my sleep. It was reported in the morning and rectified by the time I returned in the evening. The housekeepig staff kept me well supplied with tea and bottled water for use in the machine in my room which was appreciated. As stated this is my second stay in this hotel, it is well;5
We stayed 3 evenings at the New Yorker during our recent stay in New York City. The property is right across from Penn Central Station so it is convenient to catch transportation to almost anywhere you would want to go. The hotel was built in the late 20's so it sports an authentic, beautiful art deco style. The lobby is grand. The rooms are nice size, clean and very value priced. Had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. The staff was friendly and very accommodating/informative. We always felt very safe in the hotel. The gym has ample weight equipment and cardio equipment (I used it every day). There are 2 very good restaurants in the hotel, a diner called the Tick Tock and an Italian restaurant. We will stay at the hotel again.;4
"My husband and I booked this hotel through Priceline as a last minute deal on a 4 star hotel. The hotel looked fine in the lobby. Trouble started when we were told there would be a $31 facilities fee for the wifi, the workout room, and business center. This wiped out any savings over comparable hotels. Seriously? We were checking in at 8, heading out to dinner, and leaving first thing in the morning. Could the fee be waived? ""No, everyone pays the fee."" Thanks for your consideration.  It got worse when they said there is not a king bed on property, only 1 queen bed.  This would be ok had it been a normal queen, as that's what we sleep in every night, but it was short, hard, sheets scratchy and narrower than usual. Not possible for ywo normal sized adults to sleep in.  The room";2
I did not have the highest expectations of this hotel only because we paid less than $300 a night in Manhattan. Boy was I so thrilled to find this gem!!!   For our $289. a night we had 2 very clean rooms (the bedroom and livingroom) 2 full bathrooms, 2 flat screens with all the channels in a super attractive vintage art deco space. I'm sure the decor was original yet extremely well maintained.   We were right in the heart of Manhattan, close to many must see NYC attractions and close to the subway so it was just a hop to get to all of our destinations.  We will be back in June!;5
Stayed for a business trip and loved the central location of this hotel. Great staff, nice diner next door for easy meetings. Got upgraded on check-in, which is always appreciated when you travel a lot. I would absolutely stay here again, and they have some good specials so you can get a great price too!;5
I feel the hotel should have a complimentary coffee service for hotel guest since nothing is available in the room.;4
Myself and my Mum stayed here for a week while visiting NYC and we loved our experience here. We found it great value and a wonderful central location, just beside Madison Square Garden, Macys and The Empire State Building.  Their Facility fee was around $70 extra over our 7night stay, this was fully explained when we checked in and we were happy to pay the extra as the internet was handy to have in our rooms (worked perfectly) and we got free international calls home (to Ireland). I really did think there would be a catch to this but nope, all free :) The bedroom was a little small but was completely manageable and lovely and clean and nicely decorated. We also had a great view of the Empire State Building. Staff was helpful when we needed but thankfully we did not need to deal;5
Was supposed to stay five nights at this hotel, but after the first night found another hotel for the remaining four nights.  The rooms are dingy and small.  My room filled up with cigarette smoke which persisted most of the night.  In the morning there was no hot water in the shower no matter how long I ran it for.  Mercifully the water pressure was so poor I didn't get that wet anyway.  The location is good and the bed was small but comfortable.  If you are lucky with the location of your room, you get a good view of the Empire State Building.;1
The  New Yorker took us in during the blizzard when we were bumped by the ROW NYC hotel. They gave us a very reasonable rate when they could have gouged us in our stranded state. Very warm and friendly staff and the Tick Tock diner served delicious food. Would definitely stay there again!!;5
Great view from room but very very very small . Not big enough for 2 people and no space to put anything on a shelf in bathroom. Wifi in room very poor not able to connect until in lobby area. Reception area beautiful but step out of lift to get to rooms and its very old and in need of cleaning and upgrading. Staff very helpful.;3
Stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel has a mandatory fee of 25 dolars per day to use wifi...ok... when I did the check out I asked to pay this amount in cash, I was helped by Samiha or Samira, cant really remember exactly. For my surprised I was also charged at my credit card with the same amount. Never coming back here;1
All that is good about this hotel is that it is very convenient to most places: underground, Times Square, Empire State Building etc.  The only down side as other reviews have pointed out are the size of most of the rooms.  Our original room on arrival was so small you didn't even have a side table and I had to crawl over my hubby to get into bed.  The shower had been skewed out and was totally defunct and had been that way for a long time.  We asked if it could be fixed on the 1st day, 1st evening 2nd day, 2nd evening, getting the picture!  In the end on returning at 10:30pm one evening we went again to one of the 2 desks (no one tells you if it is the right one), just keep telling you they will deal with it, and one of the managers where there and moved us straight away.;2
A++++++ this hotel is not only clean and safe but has some of the best staff I have ever encountered in my travels ! Extreme clean and helpful . I would rate this hotel one of the top or hotels to stay in Manhattan!;5
Tried to find the perfect hotel for a birthday weekend for my daughter, found it The New Yorker!  It is centrally located, beautiful rooms, incredible service.  I loved the fact that no one could get to the elevators unless they showed their key to the security personal.  Our room had a spectular view of the city and was well appointed.  Matressess too soft for me.;5
I had a great room. Bed and pillows were comfortable. It was large by NYC standards. There was a view from two sides and a refrigerator. The hotel is slightly worn but a real gem. Bar mixed great drinks. All hotel staff were kind and friendly. WiFi worked well. Safe in the room. Would stay again.;4
My wife and I stayed at The New Yorker for one night on March 8.  As we checked in the front desk person handed us an envelope and informed us that as a valued customer, we had been upgraded to queen suite.  When we entered the 2-room suite on the 40th floor we were taken by the size and decor of the suite.  All amenities were outstanding.  The food at the Diner was superb and all staff we encountered were courteous.  Hotel is centrally located.  We highly recommend this hotel.;5
"Worth the stay! Close to the Garden, Penn Station and of course the Tic-Toc café which is right next store and can be accessed through the hotel lobby (important when it is snowing).  My only gripe is the room size.  It is an old hotel that is constantly making renovations, so your room will or should be modern and up to date; however, some of the rooms are really small, so when you check-in make sure the rate reflects the size.  I really do not worry about room size when I am in New York since I do not plan on spending much time in the room, so let that be your guide.....";4
Booked a double room with a view and was not disappointed. Magnificent  view of the Empire State building. The age and style of the hotel gave it a grand feeling but that also means its rooms aren't as big or pristine as a newer hotel.;4
If you want to be across the street from Madison Square Garden, Macy's or Penn Station, this is a great option.  Make sure to request a refurbished room.  They are quite comfortable, albeit some are oddly shaped, because it's an older building.  We had a view of the Garden, and it was great.  The bathrooms are very small.;4
My visits have been with my Daughter and a family friend, and we have loved it The Hotel is in a great location, its quite Central within walking distance you have  Macy,s  which is a must if you like shopping: and the Statue of Liberty, Madison Square Garden, and Penn Station just on the corner of the hotel..   The Hotel its self is lovely, it is Art Deco in design, the rooms that we have had  have all been of a good size and very comfortable. the staff we found to be very helpfull and friendly, I could go on and on but I hope this goes some way  in helping you with your choices ENJOY,,,,;5
Hotels location was fab we flew in Newark and took train to Penn station and just walked across road to hotel, so handy .  Checked in before time no problem  and I did like the security you had to pass thro to get to lifts  .  We felt safer this way . Had no problem with room  we didn't come to NYC to spent a lot of time in room . Cleaned every day  our room was v quiet  we weren't to the front which helped ..   Would defiantly come back to this hotel  as it 7 min walk to time sq. and 2 min walk to Macy's  30 seconds to Penn station and 5 mins to Empire State  . Subway at door take you to 9/11 .  What more could you want .;5
We usually stay in NJ and get a bus over but we decided to take the plunge and stay in the city. This hotel is perfectly located! We ended up with rooms on the 39th floor. We had awesome views of the city from one room and scaffolding from the other room.  The rooms were actually quiet. I thought the bathrooms were a little small and dated but very clean. We parked the car on Staten Island and took the ferry over and saved the parking fee. We also loved the fact that for $2 a bag they will hold your bag if you need to check out and still want to sightseeing. We will stay here again.;5
Wonderful place and would definitely stay here again if I go back to New York. The room had a view of the Empire State Building and was beautiful. They upgraded  for free at check-in and also the room was ready when we got there at 1:30 p.m. The room had been upgraded and even included bottled water that the housekeeper left more each day at no charge. Great location;5
Everyone very nice and room excellent. Hope to stay again. Great food at connecting restaurant. The New Yorker is a museum piece. The staff from the front desk,Doorman,security,NewYorker Historian,housecleaning. 5star haven't had that good in long time. Thanks;5
An older hotel with small rooms and modest bathrooms, The New Yorker is always clean and comfortable. It is a NYC icon, without the skyscraping prices. The location, professional staff and grand lobby make for a memorable stay.;5
Stayed in a beautifully styled room overlooking the Empire State Building and MSG. Couldn't have asked for a better room if I tried. Helpful staff and all at very reasonable rates. Diner was also very good. Would absolutely return to this hotel.  Picture is the view from my room on the 36th floor.;5
Stayed for Honey Moon. Rooms are nothing special, small and bathroom would need renovation, but they're clean and comfy. Staff is very friendly though.  Diner is awesome for breakfast and lunch.  Perfect location, probably that explain the price. Tip for geeks as us.....the genius Nicola Tesla lived and died there. Even took a pic at the door :).;4
Stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker because of its location to Madison square garden to watch the New York Rangers. Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are small but adequate, clean and quiet. The hotel has a art deco charm. The only issue we had was with the key card but was quickly and easily sorted.  And the luggage check in on our last day was really helpful and a good price.;5
Stayed here last May (2016), for 3 nights, upon arrival we were upgraded to a beautiful room overlooking the Hudson River. The bed was one of the best we've ever slept in. Room was clean, smart and the facilities were great, especially the vending machines on every floor. Bathroom was a little small, but very nice. The hotel itself is very grand, with excellent staff, and very secure. Excellent location as it is a stones throw away from Madison Square Gardens and Macys. 24 Hour diner is very convenient if arriving at any time of the day/night. Would recommend the hotel to anyone, and would definitely stay here again.;5
This must be the best located hotel in New York. Everything on your doorstep, even McDonald's directly across the road. The rooms are not huge but they are by no means tiny. Full bathroom with a great shower, felt like a power shower.  Rooms spotlessly clean, staff helpful and we had a double aspect room with a view of the Empire State Building and madison square garden.  We were able to walk from the hotel to Times Square, Central Park, Roosevelt centre, 5 avenue etc. We travelled from JFK by air train and subway and arrived right on the side of the hotel. So easy and only seven dollars each.;4
Right. The location is 5 mins walk from Times Square, Broadway and Macy's. 20 mins from Central Park. 2 train stops from JFK to Penn Street Stn. $8. Across the road. Rooms are clean and spacious.  Free WIFI. Quiet enough given its location. Security in the lobby check before you can access the lifts. Good thing. I would recommend this hotel for its location, friendly staff, cleanliness and room cleaning service.  There is a Ticket booking office in the lobby. There's a Tick Tock diner within the hotel. Open 24 hours.  Great food.;5
Our stay was all the better for staying at the Wyndham staff are very helpful. The room was very clean and fresh Very friendly and accessible for all the New York places. Of interest. Throughly enjoyed our stay here and would not hesitate to recommend it.;4
Everything was wonderful - price, location convenience, activity, a 24 hour diner just below.  My only complaint is the shower.  Not very much power and it would go from freezing cold to scalding hot in seconds without touching anything;4
Came for Westminster and the hotel was accommodating to all attendees - dogs, exhibitors and fans....It was lovely to see the dogs in the elevators and lobby!  The grooming area was helpful too.  Our room was actually spacious - perhaps because we expected another person and a roll-away bed.  The room was quiet except for sirens and honking of traffic - no plumbing or voices next door.  No excessive waits for elevators.  The walk to Madison Square Garden was convenient and the shuttle stop to the Piers was right outside the door.;5
The stay and the customer service was wonderful! The only thing that could improve is people who answer the phones. Got hung up on had to call back. Not a huge issue just annoying. Would definitely stay there again!!;4
Loved my stay at this hotel and when I go back to NYC I'm staying here again. The price isn't bad and of all the hotels I've stayed in this is by far the best one. The rooms are decent size, especially for New York City. Great location!;5
The hotel is in a great place as only a couple of minutes from Penn Station and in easy walking distance to places like Times Square, Macy's, Marriot marquee and only 30mins walk from Manhattan Cruise Terminal and the Intrepid Sea/air/space museum. Room was smart clean and welcoming (smelt clean/fresh too) but I'd say very small- hard to find space for 2 cases. Never had to wait too long for the lifts. Staff very helpful on reception. Tick Tock café handy but very busy (not part of hotel but you can enter via a door in the foyer). Prices seemed expensive in New York but exchange rate didn't help. Breakfast around £40 (for 2 px) for something basic. All in all I love the hotel and would definitely return. We actually returned a week later after our Bahamas cruise and the lovely;4
My husband and I recently stayed two nights in the New Yorker. We loved it. The rooms are small and our view wasn't the best but the overall closeness to everything makes it great. We definitely will be staying again. I had mapped out the location of the hotel compared to where we were going, I was shocked when it was literally right around the corner! Also, the convenience of it being blocks from Port Authority really helped us save a lot of time. Also, looking for the Tesla room was a hidden adventure.;5
"Love the history, the art deco, the location, the views.  True, the rooms are smallish -which makes me wonder how small they were before the broke the walls and went from 2500 to 914 rooms!  I take it that celebrities had suites.  Anyway, for a night or three it doesn't matter to us; we really just slept there and little else.  The surprise was this.  We had the most basic room booked at a low cost.  Upon checking in, I asked the receptionist for a room high up, with a view.  Normally you pay extra for those, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask.  She said, ""I think I have one for you,"" and off we went.  Upon reaching our room, we found that it was the very room occupied by Nikola Tesla for a decade!  (Famous inventor and competitor with Thomas Edison.)  I think he also died in";4
We loved our stay at the New Yorker. Our room was great, very clean and the bed was very comfortable. We arrived almost 3 hours early and they went ahead and let us check into our room. The hotel is across the street from Penn Station and very convenient to almost anywhere. We walked to Time Square and took the Subway to the Statue of Liberty. Couldn't ask for a better location! We will most definitely stay here again!;5
Ok, there are flowers in the lobby, but that, my friends is the closest this hellhole gets to being a four star hotel. We chose this hotel because it was very close to where we have to be in the morning. We got there at 5, they said our room wasn't ready yet but they had one on the executive floor, so we said great. The view is of a dumpster between two buildings, the key has already stopped working and we had to go get a new one, when I flushed the toilet, my husband starting laughing his head off... he said it sounded like an airplane was taking off behind his head. The beds are tiny doubles, and it sounds like the person above me is relentlessly pushing a very large office desk on a cement floor from one side of the room to the other just about every five minutes, just as I'm;1
Yes it is sooooooo close to Penn station. Yes it is in walking distance of so much. Yes walk to dinner and Broadway. Yes Madison Square Gardens is a stones throw away.  Yes we got a room at 9.30 in the morning which was lovely because it was freezing outside.  Yes there was a workable hairdryer in the room without asking.  But the room was tiny. The desk and chair really didn't fit in the room as the chair got in the way all the time.  No coffee making facilities but apparently you could ask.  Ok so we had a fun stay because it was oh so conveniently located.  Yes it is in the process of being refreshed.  Yes it is great Art Deco.  But the shower was hopeless.  In fact it was so pathetic a weak squirt that I couldn't face it in the morning.  So I put off having a shower for 3;4
The 43 floor New Yorker was completed in 1929 and opened for business on January 2nd 1930. Like many contemporary buildings in this part of the city (Empire State, Chrysler Buidling etc) The New Yorker was designed in the Art Deco style popular at the time. Spencer Tracey, Joan Crawford and Fidel Castro all stayed here, and Muhammad Ali recovered here after his March 1971 fight with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden.  I begin this review with these historical facts about the property, because when staying here the guest is partially buying into the idea that they have become part if that history, and the hotel in which they are staying is iconic. There is a display of the hotel's history in the basement to showcase this iconic status.  The location of the hotel is excellent,;5
Don't be fooled by the fancy entrance to this hotel, it's cheap, but I wouldn't stay there again, the rooms are way too small and the beds sleep barely 2 people. The mattresses are like rocks and extra firm, the outlets are very inconvenienced and not very many to go around unless you like cramming your hand behind the mattress and headboard . The bathroom is so tiny, and I felt claustrophobic, the shower head was more like a fire hose or a power washer, the hot and cold water was bipolar. Not the worst hotel but I've had better. If you plan on having more than two people in the room, stay elsewhere.;1
The rate is not bad considering where this hotel is located (right next to the Garden) ... also we were surprised at the room size it was spacious for sure. The ascetic and history of the hotel is amazing ... the art deco vibe is present throughout. There is some renovation still left to be done ... but that lobby is incredible and the staff is friendly. This was my second stay here and will not be my last.;5
This was our first trip to new York with our two 14 year olds so we picked the wyndham based on location and I'm glad we did. We arrived at about half 3 and got chucked in. Upon check in we got offered a choice of an extra bathroom or a room with a view and we opted for the extra bathroom. We went to room 1919 and after reading some bad reviews I was really surprised at the size of the room... it was huge. The bathrooms are small but not tiny. I did have a problem with the water running brown but I just ran the tap for about  30 seconds and it cleared. The room was also cleaned every day. The hotel is in the middle of everything, from Penn station, Marys,  times square, port authority and M.S.G. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are thinking of a trip to NYC. I;5
I stayed at the New Yorker for 2 nights: the location can't be beaten. It is located on W 34th st and 8 ave. across the street from Madison square garden. Time square lies on walking distance (10-15 minutes). Although the rooms are very small its in consensus with the average NY hotel. Good price-quality relationship with clean rooms but mediocre bathroom.;3
this was my yearly trip to New York City from Vermont. I always stay at the New Yorker as I am a professional seamstress and the hotel is walking distance to all the great fabric shops. As usual I found all of the staff wonderful. This time I had a less than desirable view, but its the only time in 10 years of coming to stay that I got a bad view. Que Sera!;5
"The hotel has a fantastic ubication in midtown Manhattan, 5 minute walk to Penn Station and 2 minutes from the nearest subway. It has very comfortable beds, we slept very well.  What I hated is that they charged 15$ per night for having wifi, and it was ""mandatory"", as the receptionist told me at our arrival.  I didn't like either the fact that the hotel is advertised with one price and then they add so many different things that in the end becomes the double you thought. They should give total amount before the booking.  The receptionists  are unfriendly.";3
My wife and I stayed at the New Yorker hotel just over 3 years ago and found it very good, it was therefore the obvious choice when we went to New York just 3 weeks ago. It's very central to most attractions, clean and you can't get to the lifts without showing you room key, security is a must for me in this uncertain world in which we live. It was our 40th wedding anniversary and the manager, Barry Raunch laid on a couple of treats for us. Also if you want a good breakfast turn right of the hotel and head down 8th avenue to around 30th street, about a 12 minute walk and you will come to a cafe called Juice Oligy, great breakfast for two at around 20 dollars, we went there every morning, far better than the tic tic diner.;5
Overlooking the Madison Street Gardens and close to Macys + the Empire State Building this is the ideal place to stay for a long weekend away.  The staff are friendly and the Tick Tock diner is very handy. The rooms were cleaned each day but there was a dog convention at the Gardens with many participants staying in the hotel. This left the lifts and hallways a little whiffy..  Price wise this was good and you are in the middle of everything - good choice this one.;4
I was very pleased with the cleanliness of the hotel and my room.  The staff was very respectful and helpful.;5
My wife and I stayed here for a few days in February 2017. It's just a few hundred yards from Penn station and an ideal base for seeing or shopping in New York city. It's a very busy hotel and reception staff are very efficient and helpful. It is extremely clean but unfortunately, it is in much need of a thorough makeover. Our room was 'compact' to say the least. Decor was dark and old fashioned and no tea/coffee making facilities!!! Still, it served us well as a base and perhaps the best feature was the Tick-Tock restaurant adjacent to it which was absolutely marvelous. Like a lot of city centre hotels, the Wyndham doesn't really need to try hard. Easy money.;3
Our family of three stayed here for 3 nights Ina room with 2 double beds and we were happy with the accommodation. The room was nicely furnished, with a desk, chair, settee, TV, fridge and coffee maker. The bathroom is very small but clean. We appreciated the friendly but vigilant security folks at the elevators who request that you show your room key to gain entry. Beautiful foyer and adjacent Tick Tock Diner for meals 24 hours. Located one block from Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station, which is very convenient if you fly into Newark and taken the train into New York City. Walkable location for Times Square and Chelsea Market. Our stay was part of a Porter Escapes package, and we recommend that you check with your service provider to determine if additional service charges;4
We have stayed in this hotel 6 years ago and were so impressed we came back. The welcome we received was equally as enthusiastic as previously but the room and especially the bathroom were very tired. Clean but tired. That said the view we had from our room was spectacular. Looking straight out on to Empire State Building and madison square garden. Good location for Macy's .. and tour buses stop outside making it very handy for tourists. The tick tick diner is attached to the hotel is pricey but fantastic . All in all a lovely hotel needs updating but service good. Views amazing;4
Great location by the train station along with Madison square garden. Rooms had recently been renovated and were in good condition. Walking distance to everything you need. It was busy while we were there but still well taken care of;4
I tried to like this place, as I like to give all establishments I visit a fair chance. I usually do not comment on hospitality service, as I like to think of myself as someone who's not very demanding-- I'm usually and easily pleased, and I don't ask for much, if at all. I only note when I feel that there has been an indelible deficiency. Perhaps they're overworked or understaffed that particular night (11 January), but I felt that the staff at the front desk at the time that I checked in (around 9.30pm on a busy evening) did not provide me with a particularly warm welcome, as they seemed impatient. They were certainly not impolite (and neither was I), but I felt uncomfortably rushed for no reason, as if I was a nuisance instead of a guest.   My room was rather roomy and;2
A classic hotel. Stayed for four nights. It's not state-of-the-art, but it was in 1930. The rooms are clean and simple. Housekeeping thorough and helpful. Breakfast included is served at the Tic Toc next to the lobby, but is not recommend, service there not good. Nothing to complain about from the hotel staff though! And ultimate location when watching a show/match in Madison Square Garden or commuting from Penn station.   Very cool to have stayed at the New Yorker.;4
The location of this hotel is just great. It is 12 minutes walking distance from Times Square. We walked to the Empire State Building and to Central Park also. Best Bagels and Starbucks are just right in the corner, so you will not need to worry about breakfast. The room was just OK. It is clean enough however do not expect much. It is a little bit noisy but it is totally understandable since it is in the middle of Manhattan. The room was also cold and the heater just stopped working in the middle of the night. But it was working the next day.;3
We are staying in the hotel and went across the road to buy a camera filter we were persuaded to buy a wide angle lens for our camera within the hour we looked on the internet to find the lens was a load of rubbish and was not compatible with our SLR camera they refused to give our money back I went into the information desk in the New Yorker and very kindly two staff members John and jibday went over to the shop and very kindly asked them to refund our money which they did reluctantly  Thank you both we had been conned for over £200  Well done hotel New Yorker;5
Room next to us kept slamming door and talking on a speaker-phone at an unreasonable volume,  Called front desk 3 times - told Security would resolve.  NO-SHOW and yet, I was charged $144.13 for a horrible experience.  Plus, we waited for 3 hours before getting our room.  Room 3028 was our room and the room of the rude woman was 3026. NEVER AGAIN!!!;1
Brilliant hotel in an awesome location. Rooms were immaculate and was upgraded which was so kind of the staff as it was our anniversary. Tic tock diner which is attached was lovely for good too and ideal for breakfast! So much choice. Staff were so friendly approachable and politex highly recommend xx;5
"The hotel is in the heart of the garment district, a block from Penn Station and there's a subway stop on the same corner; the New Yorker would be a good home base for your exploration of Manhattan. The staff is courteous and helpful, much more than I expected in NYC. There was no coffee maker in the room as in the website photos, but when I asked they brought me one in five minutes. The room was tiny, with about three feet on all sides of the bed. The bathroom was dingy, with stains on the tub and rotting grout in several places.   The New Yorker would be great for someone who only needs a place to sleep and will spend all day out an about in the nearby sights.";3
This is most important in this hotel any one go to hear because it's so nice and safety.And any members of this hotel manage their customers like receptly until check out also after that so I like it very much;5
The New Yorker is a great hotel that seems to stand as a showcase of Art Deco from the outside and within. It will make you feel like you're staying in a mini New York icon.  The lobby makes you feel like you're in a different period of time which makes it such a great place to stay. This does mean that the rooms are a little dated but they are clean and have all the usual amenities.  The location is perfect on 34th st being a short walk from the Empire State Building or Times Square. We also walked to Rockefeller centre from here and to the high line.  It's also connected to the tick tock diner that is worth using as a breakfast base!;4
Arrived for a four day break, check in was very welcoming and the staff full of chat. We got to our fabulous bedroom an opened the curtains and what a fabulous view of the Empire State Building. Unpacked our cases to loads of space for clothes and empty cases that we brought with us for shopping. Hotel is within walking space of just everything. You won't be disappointed if you pick this hotel. Oops almost forgot. Wrap up warm an wear good footwear an visit places early in the morning. Believe me it's easy to do if your used to GB time.;5
We stayed at Wyndham New Yorker from Feb.17th to Feb. 22nd, 2017. The moment we arrived we were greeted by the friendly and efficient receptionist (Linda). Our room was on the 7th floor, (one of the reconditioned floors), lovely room. It had a coffee/tea machine, hairdryer, iron- ironing board, t.v and sockets to charge phones via plug or usb. There is also a safe in the room. This is a great located hotel. 10 minute walk to Time Square and to the Empire State building. Subway across the road and Penn Street station a few minutes walk away. The resort fee covers the wi fi in the room and also the lobby. The gym, which is located downstairs next to a small business center. Also free local and international calls to mobiles or landlines to/from the room. Housekeeping were friendly;5
We were at this hotel for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The location is perfect, the rooms are huge by NY standards, very clean, updated, and the restaurants in the lobby come in handy if you don't want to get out.;5
We were staying at this hotel for the Westminster Dog Show.  We had a big dog with us.  The hotel was very accommodating and very easy to work with.  The hotel was clean and well run.  Everyone that I talked with was helpful and responsive.  It is an older property and has issues that older properties have.  But I think that the staff and excellent location over rule that issue.;4
I stayed here in Feb 17. The location is absolutely perfect! 34th street tube station is just on the other side of the road, Madison Square garden is just a block away and Herald Square (Macy's) is just a five min walk from the hotel. There's also a McDonald's directly opposite the hotel entrance. The hotel is very big and really lovely decor, it feels like 'proper New York style'. The room it self was small as almost NYC hotel rooms are. Having said that it's all the space I needed! The bed was very comfy. The bedroom and bathroom are very nicely decorated and very clean. The shower head is fixed to the wall which is personally a pet hate of mine, and the temperature was a bit temperamental to start with but other than that it was fine. Plenty of towels and toiletries for my;5
Nice big room, asked for coffee maker at check in and it was in my room quickly.  Check in staff and room security were all very helpful and professional.  Easy 4 block walk to Javitz Center.  Many restaurants and Delis within a block or two.  Starbucks right across the street.;5
Lovely hotel very helpful and friendly staff great for kids and family's and also couples  Very central easy access to everywhere walking distance to everything g would recommend to everyone for sure  Hope to be back there soon;5
"My wife and I travel often and have stayed at numerous Wyndam hotels.  We generally have had great experiences.  We stayed at the the New Yorker on a short trip to the city to the City to see a Broadway play and see a few sites.  Checked in at noon, but the room wasn't ready until 3.  Room was small and dated, but had a classic feel.  Slept fine, but there was a problem in the morning.  Sink didn't drain and you couldn't control the temperature of the shower.  Totally bumbed us out.  Had to take cold showers and had to brush our teeth with a full sink. When I booked the room on the Wyndam site, I was surprised to see a $34 ""activity fee"" added to the room.  I don't mind paying for a nice room, but this hotel is really old and substandard.   I reported the plumbing issues to the";1
Perfect location next to Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station (if commuting from Newark Airport). Easy walk to Times Square and Broadway. Bit of a hike to Central Park but the subway is across the street. Helpful front desk will take care of any concerns. Booked a two double bed  room since we were a family of three. Good size refurbished room with fridge and coffee maker. There may be a facilities charge if it is not included in your booking with your agent or site so you should check ahead of time.;5
This beautiful hotel has such an interesting history and is also in a very convenient location. We were able to easily walk to Times Square and the theater district. Our room was rather small, but I think that is to be expected in the city. The furnishings were pretty and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!;4
Our Favorite hotel when staying in the city. Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden, practically right across the street. Excellent location for restaurants, entertainment, or just strolling around the city. Everyone who works there really great, including Mohammed who checked us in. Very professional and helpful!  Went to Tick Tock Diner in the hotel again for dinner-delicious! Room was very nice & had an amazing view of Empire State Building, 7th floor. Over all another great stay! Thanks to all !;5
Extremely pleased with service and quality of the Wyndham New Yorker hotel. Also being located so close to New York Penn Station train was a bonus.;4
Great Location, rooms comfortable and spacious, cleaned every day. Staff very helpful.  Used guest services a few times and they couldn't have been any more helpful. Madison Sq Gardens very close by, we went to see the Harlem globetrotters, which was suggested by the hotel staff, just brilliant. Times square very close by and Mcdonalds across the street which was fine for an early breakfast with my teenage son.  Couldn't fault this hotel at all and I'm a fussy so in so   Will definitely return;5
Excellent accommodations and service. I am a New Yorker and staying at this hotel was both convenient and comfortable. The service was as expected. I stayed on the 20th floor and my room had 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms! Perfect. The Tick Tock restaurant was the best for a quickie snack and to chat with old friends.;4
When your paying the money we have for 4 nights you expect luxury. When you arrive you feel like the entrance is luxurious. You get I  the ornate lifts and then open your room door. Small is all I could say. Then look out of single pain windows with wind rushing through the gaps. This isn't going to be a quiet hotel. Then into the bathroom to freshen up on what looks like he original bath and taps from when the hotel was built In the early 1900's. I wish I could say it was spotless I can't.  The stains were everywhere. So time for a shower, you can have either boiling hot or freezing cold. No in between.  If I had kids I would be taking a lawsuit our for third degree burns right now. So if you like listening to Hill St Blues whilst trying to sleep stay here. 2nd night I had;3
Daughter needed a get a way date with mom so NYC sounded perfect.  I picked the Amtrak and she picked the hotel.  Who knew we were going to get a deal through Amtrak.  best location across from Penn Station.  We got there early and spoke with Mohamed on check in.  No issue with the early check in and moved to a room with twins instead of queen which was only option on line at no additional cost.  Mohamed was so very helpful with suggestions on dinning, shows, and sites.  Room was great with size that was amazing for the price.  Thank you walk in shower after two days of sight seeing.  I used guest services for show ticket options and they recommended the greatest Sunday brunch.  Will definitely be returning and recommending.;5
A wonderful stay again.  Services by staff exceptional. Location central all points and for my stay rewarding, convenient, and restful.;5
Stayed here for the Westminster Kennel Club Show.  The room, while 20ties Art Deco style, was clean, fresh & comfortable. We've stayed here a number of times & different rooms, the bathrooms are tiny, but plenty of hot water & towels, etc. This year retrieving our car was super fast (A vast improvement)  We'll be back;4
First of all The New Yorker can't be beat for location! We took the train and my daughter and I were able to easily walk the block to the hotel from Penn. Then Mohammad gave us the most beautiful room and he was such a nice person to handle our checkin. He is pleasant and very kind. He wanted to make sure my daughter got a lovely view which I had paid extra for. The lobby at the hotel is lovely.  There is a diner below and security at the elevators. What more could you want?;5
I totally loved this hotel!  It's old-fashioned charm amid the glass and steel buildings around it was comforting and delightful.  My bf and I stayed here while attending a toy show at the Javit's center.  It was an easy walk from the hotel right to the center.  Our room was amazing!  Probably because I expected it to be small and merely a room with a bed in it.  Instead, it had a separate sitting area with a couch and desk, a mini kitchen area with refrigerator and sink and a Keurig!!  That's fancy smancy compared to the usual mini coffee pot.  My only complaint - if you call it that - was no decaf coffee.  They may have had some if I'd called, but it wasn't that important.  If it was there I would have had it.  Otherwise, it was cool.  But, there was some sleepy time tea and;5
I had a nice stay here, the staff are very helpful and welcoming, the building is pretty and extremely well located.  However, this is NOT a four star hotel by any normal standards. The room was small even for New York, the bathroom was tiny and completely basic and there were few amenities over the bare essentials.  Recommended if you will scarcely be there but other 4 star options offer more.  Free wifi though!!;3
Absolutely fantastic location when we first arrived check in was quick and easy and thanks to Mohammed we got an upgraded room with spectacular views of the Empire State. Couldn't fault anything about this hotel would definitely stay here again.;5
Stayed in family room 13-17 Feb 2017. Excellent location for Empire State/Macys and only a short stroll from Penn Station. Only 6 blocks walk to Times Square. OnsiteTick Tock Diner also good for food and a couple of 7/11s nearby. Wok to Work good for carry out Chinese across the road.;5
Stayed here on our anniversary and they took great care of us . Rooms were overbooked however we were upgraded to a suite on 43rd floor ...MSG a stone throw away. Great central area great for shopping as well .;4
Had a wonderful stay at The New Yorker during the Westminster dog show - room was small with two double beds but we weren't in our room that much and it was very tastefully decorated. The bathroom was also small and my only complaint was that the water was hard to get adjusted as far as temperature. We had a beautiful city view out of our 20th floor window. Fantastic location within walking distance of so so much ... and Penn Station is right down the street ...;4
"This hotel is undoubtably the worst I have ever stayed in; I don't even know where to begin! Upon arrival we had a lengthy wait to be checked in and were then greeted by rude staff - not exactly what you expect at a supposed 4 star hotel. During check in, I had to hand over my credit card for a fee of $22 for our 4 night stay, when I asked what I was being charged for I was told this was a fee was to cover both of us for using WiFi and the phone. I've no idea why this hotel advertises that it has free wifi when it clearly doesn't - false advertisement must play a big role in how this hotel manages to get bookings.    Before we booked this trip we checked out photos of the room online and we thought they looked fine! Nothing extravagant or overly fancy but nice - we couldn't have";1
I LOVE this hotel.   The original art-deco, the ambiance and history.  It also has the BEST lobby for people watching in NYC.  The attached Tick-Tock Diner is wonderful, great menu and great food.  The hotel and rooms was clean and the bed were very comfortable.  I asked for a room with a view, and boy what a view I got!!!!;5
Stayed at the New Yorker for 5 nights and the hotel was great!! We were upgraded to a room with a view because they had put us down for a room with 2 beds but we only needed 1. The view was amazing! The hotel itself is really well located as well, only about a 5-10 walk to Times Square and opposite Penn station and Madison square garden. Being opposite Penn station was brilliant for us because we got a train from Newark which was only $13 dollars each. The diner is really nice for breakfast as well and not overly pricey. Overall great stay at a beautiful & historic hotel with very helpful staff, would definitely come back!;5
Well, first time in this city and hotel. the hotel is perfectly located, short walk to Times square, has madison arena next door so usually some big names on. Red hot chilli peppers when we were there and Billy Joel week after.Short walk to Times Square. Only had food once in the restaurant inside hotel, as there was that many to go to but the one time we did it was very good. Bar a little expensive. Paid over $8.00 for a stella but then again this is New York. Staff are all friendly and helpfull  and I would like to say a big Thank you to Mohamed who upgraded our room to one with a city view at no extra. This guy couldn't do enough to make sure were were happy. Even phoned our room as soon as we were in just to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. If we return to New;5
We stay at the New Yorker every year for the Westminster Dog Show. The staff is always wonderful. They have many different room types. If it is not overly busy, they allow you to check out your room before checking in. We love the rooms with two bathrooms! The bathrooms are not large, but having two saves marriages! A short walk to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Times square. My husband loves the Tic Tock Diner as it is open 24 hours with good food and he can order breakfast any time of day. Great cheesecake too.;4
The stay was tremendous. The hotel is within walking distance of so many attractions in NYC, and has a subway station right in front of the building so travel to other areas/attractions is a breeze as long as you can navigate the subway. The room was very nice, a little out dated, but still enjoyable. Only draw back is the lack of heat or vents in the bathroom and old windows. We had to have the heat turned up in the 80s just to have the room feel comfortable due to the drafty windows. Restaurants in the hotel lobby were amazing. Staff seemed nice but overbearing at times (they check on you if you leave your do not disturb sign on the door, which defeats the purpose of the do not disturb sign). All in all a good stay, but pricey for what you get;4
Only our first night here and already feeling very spoilt with an upgrade of room with a view, and what a view! Thank you to Mohamed for being so very helpful at check in. First time in New York for both my daughter and me to celebrate her coming of age at 21.  Lovely room too, very clean and very comfy beds. Thank you the New Yorker hotel!!;5
First of all the hotel is in a great location for all site seeing activities. A Big Bus Tour stop is right outside which is great. Had to wait longer on our room which was abit of a pain but as a result we were upgraded.  We stayed in an unrefurbished room which was still great and very spacious.  WIFI in the lobby and in rooms. Safe and hairdryer provided. Only complaint is the way we were treated by security staff. One night both our key cards stopped working and we could not access the room. It was about 8pm and we had brought back food which was already cold and we were hungry. Seeing as we were on the 23rd floor we decided to just sit outside the room and eat it and then go to reception to get everything sorted. This decision was made because it was a burger and therefore;3
The location of this hotel is very convenient.  They have improved their check-in and check-out process.  Rooms were clean and everything functional although a lighted clock at night would have been better along with a plug by the bed for charging cell phones. We ate in the restaurant and the diner and both were good.  I park in the garage behind the hotel which is typical NYC pricing and waiting for your car.  It just amazes me the price midtown hotels get per night for a room including various taxes.  This is better than some, but more than it used to be.;5
Room was a bit small but clean and well appointed, staff very helpful and passed on some good advice, the diner at street level was popular but that is because the food is good, most attractions within walking distance.;4
I was staying in this historical place during my studying in Kaplan. Despite its wonderful and historic rooms, there are  3 floors in this hotel are offered to students where there are no luxury suites. However, I must admit it is a really good alternative for students who always desire to stay in the heart of the city. The great location allows you to be everywhere on time as it`s between 8 and 34th street close to Madison Square Garden, Empire State building, Macy`s and others. I should mention, that conditions for students are pretty comfortable. One of the floor has a well-equipped kitchen, a cozy lounge with a library and a table for billiard. Such a nice place to gather together after school.  Also, you are available to use all hotel service like gym, laundry etc. Thank;5
Excellently restored classic hotel. The double room was comfortable and well appointed with a desk, chairs and two closets.   Staff was helpful and kind.   Great location for Madison Square Garden and 34th Street shopping.   Tick Tock restaurant for breakfast was well priced and good food. There are several reasonable priced restaurants nearby - local and chain restaurants.;5
Facilities here are very impressive room had absolutely everything in it you could need inc free wi fi! loved the modern bathroom & design of the room the bed is sooo comfortable. Location of the hotel is fantastic it's slap bang in the middle of everything lots of great shops / restaurants within walking distance the tube station is right underneath the hotel. I had breakfast in their own restaurant loved it's authentic diner style appearance with it's all American breakfasts! Staff are very friendly here & very helpful just had a really enjoyable stay here looking forward to coming back.;5
"I stayed at the New Yorker for two nights with my 18-year old son and my sister. We booked two rooms. Since we were flying in on a red-eye from the West Coast, we decided to book my sister's room for the previous night so we could get right into it when we arrived on Saturday morning. My son had a series of auditions that day and needed access to a shower first. We added this extra night after making the initial reservation. The agent I spoke to on the phone said he would 1) make a note on the reservation that we would be checking in on Saturday morning and 2) link the extra night's reservation to my sister's existing reservation so she could stay in the same room. Neither of these things were done. When we arrived on Saturday morning, the front desk agent said, ""You were";4
Great location. Service cold and anonymous. Unexpected resort charge worked out at £25 per night - covered expensive wifi but mandatory. Not visible with Expedia booking until confirmation. Tick tock diner next door great for breakfast. Hotel tired!;3
This hotel is old but clean and tidy but the room is a bit small. However, it has everything we need even though the resort fee is bit high. Overall, we impressed this hotel and will revisit it if we are in New York again.;4
This was our second time staying at this hotel during the Westminster Dog Show week.  The hotel offers shuttle buses to the Piers for Breed judging and is right across the street from MSG for the Group judging and BIS so it works out well for exhibitors.  It isn't the glitziest hotel but it's clean and well run.  Both the diner and the Trattoria serve great food.  Most importantly, the staff are phenomenal.  Kudos especially to Joe the valet who, in addition to giving us terrific service, really took an interest in us and our dog.  It made our trip to New York all that much more enjoyable.;4
The hotel is an older  hotel in New York. It is very clean and the staff are amazing. 24 hour service. Tick Tock restaurant was a great place to fill up first thing in the morning pancake eggs bacon and tea.;5
Amazing surprise.   Wonderful Restautant 24 hr service.  Kind and intelligent workers in hotel.  Clean and modern rooms with great beds and linens.  Nice amenities too.  West side near Jacob habits center.  Close enough to walk to  Theatre or Hell's Kitchen.    Great for business.;5
"The New Yorker Hotel is an older property.  If you're looking for glitz and top-tier rooms, this is not your hotel.  If you are looking for a reasonably well maintained hotel, with an extremely professional staff, timely housekeeping and a great location, this is a good option. Standard rooms, baths and closets are mid-20th century small; suites are considerably more roomy.  While there is some street noise--this is NYC--I heard nothing from the rooms next to me and, since this was the week of the Westminister Dog Show, there were big dogs in rooms on either side of me. There are a sufficient number of elevators and, in 8 days at the hotel, I never had to wait for one. Beds have good mattresses, linens and lots of pillows. Speed and reliability of WiFi is better than average.";4
The room was a small one but  i will never forget the quality of sleep we had!! After  a really  lot of walking the good sleep that offers a mattress is priceless!!!! I really would like to know the layers cooperating company!!;4
Really clean , and good place to be . Always I have to good to New York City I go that place and enjoy mi time up there.  I would recommend the New Yorker because the people to work there. And the plus being just a couple blocks away from everywhere;5
We had both negative and positive experience with this hotel, so I´m a bit divided. This might be a bit long, so stay with me :)  First of all, the check-in was good, effective and professional. I asked for a room on a higher floor with a view a few weeks in advance, but we got none of this. But we did get a  refurbished room since I am a Expedia+ Gold-member, but in the 7th floor, and the view was right into the wall.   The room was cold when we came, but the heater worked fast, but there was no heat in the bathroom. I was looking forward to a warm shower since it was a cold day, but the shower had horrible water pressure, the temperature was impossible to fix (burning hot or freezing cold), and the tiles on the floor was so cold that event though I left the hot water running;3
Lovely size room,great location . Old hotel but beautiful.great food in the tick tick diner open 24hrs a day.staff very friendly ,beside penn station ,Macy's Empire State Building.10 minute walk to time sq;5
This hotel had a great central location , but the rooms were small, although ours had a great view. The only real drawback was noise from other rooms which kept me awake, the walls seemed paperthin. It wouldn't have mattered too much to a couple maybe, but we have a 9 yr old and after a day walking round New York we were ready for an early night.;4
Staying this hotel during Christmas week with family of 4. Hotel is not so new but got a good price. Booked this hotel 4 months before traveling to NY. All facilities are in working condition...so no complain. Got to stay at high floor. Facing empire state building. Every night this building being lit up. Beautiful sight. We were so lucky to have this room. We have 2 queen size bed and a TV. No electric kettle provided. Bring your own. Supermarket is right below the hotel. Ver convenient. Will come back again if time permit. Love NY;4
It was a great experience to stay in this hotel very close to Times Square  The room was good with a wonderful view! We had a delicious breakfast as well Thanks a lot to all the staff ! We recommend this hotel !;4
I only stayed for one night but was blown away. Central location a few minutes from Penn station, the staff on reception were really friendly and helpful. I was upgraded to a room with a view for free and could have just spent all my time looking out the window! I was on the 24 floor and the view was unbelievable of the empire state building. The bag storage is really good too so you can leave your bags while you hit Macy's which is just around the corner. I will definitely be back!;5
We had a fabulous time here. Very central. Across the road from penn station. Very easy to get to from jfk. Minutes from empire state, maceys, time square and broadway to name a few!! Tick tocks restaurant is great although they are cheeky waiting for their tips!!  We would deff stay here again;5
This hotel is superbly situated between downtown and uptown, 2 blocks from the Empire State. The rooms are basic however they are comfortable as are the beds. The staff are friendly and there is s very nice restaurant attached to it. There's also a diner that serves a nice breakfast;4
This hotel is historic and in a very good location in New York.  There is an amazing art deco style lobby,  the security is good as they check your key card when you enter the elevator area and the rooms are comfortable.  Our room wasn't an outside one but that didn't matter because we were hardly ever in it.  The cleaner did a great job everyday.  Everyone is very welcoming and polite. As I've mentioned the location is great not very long to times square and if you walk out the door and go to the street corner on your right you will see the empire state building and carrying on going to your right is the massive new york post office building! There is a subway station entrance near by and Penn station.  The big bus tour bus stops right outside on the red route stop 15. It's;5
After staying around the world trade centre area, we stayed here for 2 nights. Room was clean and comfortable - 2 double beds for 2 adults and 1 child. Location is excellent. Bit annoying that you have to show your room key everytime you want to use the lifts, especially when you're pushing a pram and have bags but understand it's a security thing. Didn't use any of the facilities - think there is a gym etc. Subway was only few minutes walk away as was everything else. Staff at check in couldn't have been nicer. Staff at check out however were rude - didn't ask did you enjoy your stay or say anything at all. Just took room key and that was it.;4
From the moment you enter you are greeted by staff and they will help direct you. Reservations was efficient and congenial. I was arriving late due to coming from a trade show directly but they had my reservation correct, room ready and all was well.  I was meeting a relative so I wanted to settle quickly. Found my room and it was surprisingly nicely done for the price of this midtown hotel. The place was entirely clean, not dusty, and no sign anyone else had been there. The housekeeping staff did a fine job. Everything was properly clean, folded, tucked, and set up for my stay.   I packed away my gear and headed out to dinner. I did want to report that their safes DO NOT hold more modern computers or widescreen ones. No matter what you do. Fortunately, I felt it was fairly safe;4
Enjoyed a three night stay at the New Yorker,an old fashioned hotel near Penn station New York. This is not a modern swish New York hotel but a quirky Art Deco palace with loads of character and great staff, they even give us an upgrade on our room when they noticed it was my wife's birthday. So we ended up with a good view and a quiet room.  Close to Madison Square Garden arena,Penn Station Macy's ,the Empire State Building and access to Metro for the rest of the city. Not the best hotel I have ever stayed in but one I would use again and again.;4
Just returned from 4 night stay .On check in they had received my e-mail notifying them of my birthday and we were upgraded to a suite overlooking Empire State amazing view.No coffee maker but if you ask they will give you one no charge.Tick Tock diner great for breakfast ,security amazing ,staff very helpful just  wonderful hotel with character can't wait to stay here again.Anyone taking notice of people's negative comments ignore them you know rooms in New York hotels are not massive  you have come to enjoy the sights not stay in your room.Also your travel agent should know when you book about your extra fees on check out . Roy & Jen from Manchester UK;4
Visited New York for the first time from 4th-7th Feb and stayed in The New Yorker. The hotel is well placed for exploring midtown as it's next to Madison Square Garden and close enough to Times Square and The Empire State Building. We were on the 7th floor in a newly refurbished room which was clean enough and had coffee making facilities however the bathroom was tiny. We also had a great view of the Empire State Building. Liked the hotel and for our budget it was fine but would maybe try another hotel next time.;4
Stayed here for 4 nights on 4th Feb with a friend. We arrived just after  noon and check in was from 2pm but our room was ready so that was great.  At check in we were told of a $22 per night facilities charge payable on check out for use of WiFi and conference room. Then we were told we had to pay a $300 deposit.  I refused as we hadn't been made aware of this when booking the hotel. I was then told I can use a credit card to pay this but I again refused as I didn't want to give out my bank details.  After a few minutes we were told to pay a $200 dollar deposit. We did as we were getting annoyed by this and we just wanted to get to the room as it had been a long day of travelling.   Once in the room it was clean and spacious with a nice view of the empire state building and;4
Location next to Penn Station has always been a plus as you can catch the Amtrak to Washington or Boston, or takes the train the JFK and Newark. As for the hotel it's heyday was in the 30's when it opened and that continued through the the start of the 60's. The foyer is still impressive even if it has been slightly remodelled. If you are lucky enough to get a view looking towards the Empire State Building, it is one of the finest views in Manhatten. The room was well furnished but possibly a little smaller than we are used to in modern hotels, but perfect for my use. The bathroom, often the criticism of this hotel, was clean and well equipped, not modern...but it all works. The air conditioner has been shoehorned into this old building and does its job but can be a little;4
"The best feature is the great location near Penn Station (access to Amtrak and subway A,C,E,1,2,3 trains)  Near Empire State Bldg & Macy's.  10-15 min. walk to Time Square.  Mc Donald's & Staples just accross, but feel free to explore the area for lots of great restaurants.  Lobby is nice.  Beware of ""facilities fee"" add-on when you book your room.  This is a required fee that covers internet, phone, business office, fitnesss facility.  Regular room is small but not too tight.  Strong water pressure for bath and faucet but they use separate dials for hot and cold water (total of 4), so you cannot mix and feel the water temperature from faucet then transfer to shower.  thick towels, nice bed linen and a comfortable sleep.  10 elevators means a short waiting time.  Luggage storage";4
A 2 night stay on the 22nd floor with amazing views.  On 8th Avenue it is a prime location in easy reach of the subway to anywhere you would want to go.  A block away you can see the Empire State Building. A couple of blocks to Macy's store.   The hotel rooms are small and basic with a shower over a bath. The bed linen is high quality.  No one seems to mind you taking food to your room and you can get anything from coffee to a full take away there are so many places to buy food.   The reception area is very grand and the staff are polite, welcoming and knowledgable. Our room was not ready until 4pm but check out is mid day so this maybe a common occurrence.   I would stay again if I were to go to New York again.;4
This hotel is amazing the room was perfect the hotel staff were so nice. I did not want to leave. I had a wonderful time. The restaurant had good food close to many shops my room had a view of the Empire State Building. Beautiful;5
The hotel is typical of many hotels - beautiful lobby, drab hallways and rooms. The room was of a reasonable size for a city centre. The room was clean but looked quite drab and dreary and in need of refurbishment. My main complaint was that the hotel decided to land an extra $22 per person plus tax for use of the wi-fi, phone calls, business centre and fitness centre. This is a hefty fee and one which I was not aware of when I booked the holiday through the travel agent. Clearly the travel agent knew nothing of it either. The location of the hotel is excellent being near Penn Station and MSG.;3
Yes - rooms are not very big , but they do the job!  Bed very comfy - clean room -adequate  bathroom. For the price very good you get what you pay for. Asked for coffee maker in room - no problem  This was a shopping trip for Christmas - very central , easy access to shopping, Times Square etc. I have visited quite a few times so know what I want.  This was a return visit to this Hotel it is so central and good value for the money at this time of the year. As a Brit and the Pound being terrible vs the US $ at the moment it was expensive eating out but overall shopping very competitive.  One tip- If you want to see a show-  I don't pre-book I pop into theatre and ask what they have - we got tickets to see the show of choice- 6th row from the front of stage at a knocked down price;4
"Since some time they charge you a so called ""Ressort Fee"". For 29 $ you can use their Fitness-Room (i never do), you can make international calls (i use modern ways of communiction - so I never use) and you get access to their Wifi. What I don't understand is, why they do write everywhere, that they have free Wifi. So additional 29 $ if you stay a longer time you quickly have quite a lot money to pay for things you don't use or are supposed to be free. This is an absolute no go.   Although I really like the location of the hotel in the middle of Manhattan. Their rooms are clean but sometimes just a little small for what you pay. If there wouldn't be the Ressort fee, I would recomend this hotel to others. But with the Ressort fee, I don't";1
Gorgeous hotel really helpful staff our room had a lovely view but  was really small we didn't complain cause we were only there for 3 days and were out sight seeing most of the time there was no coffee maker in room but downstairs sells lovely coffee and the diner does really lovely breakfast;4
Average sized rooms for this age of hotel. Good value. Excellent Gym. Close to time square and other things to do. Close to subway and penn station;4
Heart of NYC Classic, clean hotel. Good price. Room was little, but enough. Enjoyed Would come back It would've been perfect if we could have succeeded on checking in early. That was impossible and other gests waited in the lobby in the same situation...;4
WOW super amazing hotel I stayed here for a week during my stay the staff looked after me and made sure I celebrated my birthday to the max upgrade on arrival a bottle of wine and meal on the houseFAB;5
Great location  - next to Madison Square Garden, several subway lines run under the hotel, Macy`s, PATH train station, Times Square is less than 10 min walk - amazing history of the building with stunning art deco interior. However our twin room was a bit small and the double beds are short (though the matress was perfectly firm for me).  There was no kettle in the room to make tea or coffee in the morning.  Staff was profiessional but when I complained about the smoke smell in the bathroom and about the draught around the window, they coldly apologized and that was it.   Paying the $29.00 facilites fee is a bit much if you have to pay for leaving your luggage there after check out. That $2.00 per suitcase could be really covered from the facitilies fee.;3
This hotel is conveniently located on 8th Ave and 34th St close to Penn Station. The lobby is pretty impressive and the staff at the front desk was very friendly. My room has everything I needed. It was small, but I guess that's normal for New York. If you have ever tried to find a good hotel in New York for a reasonable price - this is one. However, don't look too close: the bathroom was okay, but certainly not perfectly clean.;3
Booked in for two nights pre cruise. Great location, close to Macys etc etc. Welcoming staff, we had a great room with a view of the Empire State, and two Queen size beds, our friends not so lucky, a double bed with a view of the wall. Unable to move them as full. Tick Tock very convenient, huge portions. good breakfast, very busy with walk in customers.Staff very helpful, we returned to the hotel after disembarking from the ship, and were able to leave our luggage with them for a small charge as we had a late flight home.;4
My daughter and I stayed here for the night and loved it!  Great location.  Right in the center of everything!  We went to a concert at the Madison Square Garden, which was only 1 block away.  Loved the history of the hotel and the art deco.  Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was very clean and spacious. We even ordered room service from the Tick Tock Diner and had a quick delivery.  Will definitely stay again when visitiin New York!;5
The rooms here are hit or miss, but the staff and location are amazing!  For basically the same price I've had a 39th floor corner suite with a view of Time Square on one side and a view of the Hudson Ruver on the other.  I've also had a room so tiny I could barely move with a view of a ventilation shaft.;4
We stayed here for 2 nights in January, prior to a cruise, and were delighted to find such an attractive, comfortable, well positioned hotel in the heart of Manhattan. 2 blocks from Empire State Building, walking distance to Broadway and Times Square. The reception staff, particularly Mohamed, were most helpful, and despite our early arrival, were given a spacious room, overlooking the Hudson River. The bathroom was small, but fine, with a very powerful shower. There was a very interesting lower ground floor gallery, with the history of the hotel on display, and a 24 hour coffee shop/restaurant on the ground floor. We would definitely book this hotel again.;5
The room I got was small, but it had a view of the Hudson, as I had requested. Staff were very friendly and warm - especially Mohammed, the front desk clerk. I stayed for 2 nights, ate at the Tick Tock Diner, and had easy access to Penn Station (Amtrak, commuter rail, and subway), Madison Square Garden, and the business district centered around 35th and 8th. I'll be back!;4
"We spent 6 days in this fabulous hotel. You walk  into a beautiful reception area where you are greeted by really friendly reception staff. We had asked if the hotel could put something in our room for my grand-daughter from ""Santa"", as she was worried he would not know she was in New York. They went above and beyond with this request, by putting a sign on the door telling Santa she was in that room and a lovely present on her bed. Thank you all very much. The Tick Tock diner is great, a fab way to start your day. If we are ever lucky enough to return to New York we will definitely be staying here. Within walking distance to Time Square and a sub way right across the road for all the tourist spots. Thank you all we had a fantastic stay.";5
"To begin, there are other hotels that are cheaper with better sized rooms in different parts of the city.  So why would you ever want to stay here?  Honestly, because the New Yorker encapsulates Manhattan. Many would say it IS Manhattan. Do you know Nikola Tesla lived here? On the other side of the street you have Madison Square Garden. At the base of the hotel, you have the Tick Tock diner. NYC food is known for two nostalgic things; Diners, and Pizza. Are you a goth group wanting to sit around and drink coffee at 3 in the morning? Head here! Are you a Millenial wall street exec hired to do a crappy job updating trade systems and need somewhere to grab a bite after a grueling 12 hr shift? Eat here! Are you an artist looking to draw their next epic? Yep, you guessed it!  Travel";5
Stayed for 5 nights in mid January. This hotel is in a great location, close to a lot of attractions and a subway station. The decor is quite art deco as you would expect from the older hotels. We had one issue at check in where we are asked for a credit card to pay facility charges (around $23 per day). Having not been informed of this when booking, we didn't understand at  first, but it became clear that the charges would be refunded if no facilities were used. So all good!  Rooms were small but equipped with everything you need, including iron and ironing board. The hairdryer was great! We were on the 28th floor and had a slight view but our friends on the 23rd floor didn't. All staff were friendly and would speak to you, and the concierge was very helpful with planning;4
Front desk staff are RUDE,  they just don't care. They have charged me for a service  that I did not have. Three members of staff who each told me that I would not be charged yet on check out I was charged and had to go through the exchange with a very rude member of staff who clearly lacked any customer service skills, to get the bill amended BUT guess what I was still charged on my cc card and now waiting for a refund which I know will not come. Then I have just discovered that they have taken an additional $80 for something I know nothing about this is THEFT!.  I upgraded my original room which was the size of a rabbit hutch to a room on the 37th which was the size of a very small garden shed!  so disappointing. The wardrobe was the smallest and worst design I have seen in;1
Stayed here for 4 nights was basic but had everything we needed, was clean and staff nice enough. the only thing they didn't tell you is the deposit of $250 dollars they take from credit card when you check in and then refund when you check out minus you tourist tax.;5
Spent a long weekend at Christmas. Chose the Wyndham for it's location and were not disappointed. Subway just across the street which made getting around super easy. The diner style restaurant attached to the lobby had great breakfast choices. Found a couple of great restaurants in Hell's Kitchen (went to Cara Mia twice) which were easy to get to. Room was cozy but comfortable with nice decor. The hotel lobby is a gorgeous art deco classic.The views were awesome!;4
If you are looking for a classic New York hotel that has been around forever, this is your place. It's close to Madison Square Gardens/Penn Station, the famous Macy's, Time square and lots of other attractions.;4
Stayed for 2 nights with my wife before moving on to Vegas. The hotel is full of character and in its day would of been amazing. A bit dated now but as are most things in NY. Couldn't fault the room and never had to wait long for the lifts. All in all we had an enjoyable stay. Would I return, maybe not. Great location for MSG and a short walk to TS.;4
Me and my mum stayed here for 5 nights in Jan. The hotel is an excellent location on the corner of 34th street and 8th Ave.   The room we stayed in was on the 27th floor, it was a bit on small side, but that didn't bother us, as we were only use the hotel as a base.  The room was lovely and clean, and cleaned everyday. The only small complaint that I would make is that the room was a little on the cool side, obviously there wouldn't be an issue with this if you stayed in the spring or summer.  All the staff were friendly and super helpful.  The hotel is in a excellent location, with Macy's just a short walk up 8th Avenue and lots of eating places within short walking distance.   Overall and excellent hotel, I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again;4
Room - Metro Room 1 Queen Bed Non-Smoking - Although small, the room was very clean, with modern furnishings, and comfortable bed. Digital thermostat in room. All in good condition.  Location - Right across the street from Penn Station, everything within one block (CVS pharmacy, Starbucks, ACE subway train) Amenities - mini soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, hairdryer in bathroom, flat screen TV, extra outlet on lamp to charge devices, electric/digital safe in top drawer of dresser.  Although we only stayed for one night, we very much enjoyed this hotel, especially the convenience of the cocktail bar, snack bar, and diner right on the premises. Would highly recommend to anyone.;5
Sorry for late review. We got a taxi ffrom outside the airport which is the best way as you can sit back and look at the scenery, 55 dollars I think. We had my husbands birthday here and all the staff was very friendly and polite. Food in the bar reasonable and big portions. When they knew it was his birthday they gave us a bottle of champers and 2 x free vouchers for breakfast at the diner which was awesome. I think one staff called Linzi absolutely lovely and the lady security. There nothing they wont do, if you aren't happy they will resolve your query. I liked the way you have to show your hotel card to security before entering the lifts. This hotel has got small rooms but it shouldn't matter as you are out most of the time. Supermarket across the road dunking doughnuts open;5
I loved this hotel! The view from our window was amazing! Without being particularly high we had an amazing view from one window of Madison square garden, which is just over the street, and then a direct view of the Empire State Building! Such a delight to wake up to those views every morning I was there.;5
Enjoyed my stay as location is extremely convenient to transportation and attractions.   Classic hotel that shows its age in some areas however very well kept.   Please note bathroom size not forgiving but staff is helpful and accommodating.;4
Stayed in this hotel with family for my Birthday. As it was my Birthday our room was upgraded. The room was fantastic with a bedroom with 2 queen size beds a sofa bed in the lounge. We had 2 bathrooms and 2 TVs. Also a view of the Empire State Building from our window. The location was just what we wanted central to everything. The food was good in the restaurant and the staff helpful and friendly. While we were staying at this hotel we booked to go to Nigeria Falls for my Birthday which I would highly recommend. I would stay in this hotel again and highly recommend it.;5
Excellent choice if you want to be centrally located to visit most of the main attractions without taking the public transportation or Taxi. The hotel is really nice, a bit outdated.. but spotless and great atmosphere (historical place). Everything working perfectly in the room (Room 3232). Super friendly staff (all services!!) all very professional.  Quite amazing to have such level of client service from the whole team working there !  Breakfast was included in my room rate.. but better to go outside (in my opinion), cheaper places closeby to have breakfast for same or better quality. Outside of that, the hotel is perfect.. I will definitely go back for my next trip to NYC ! Layla;5
Stayed here for three nights. Could see Empire State Building from our bedroom. Penn station just across the road, a walk away from Times Square, all the theatres and many more attractions. Room very comfy, hotel got the art deco feel. Good check in, staff very, very nice. Tick Tock diner in hotel serves very good food for a reasonable price. Would definitely use this hotel again.;5
Room was smaller than motels outside of the city, but very conveniently located and the view was great. Clean, comfortable and restful after a full day.  Quiet with nice ambiance, guest orientated and very safe. Would stay again.;4
When I stay now in NYC I always try to stay at the Wyndham New Yorker due to their great customer service and the warm feeling the staff gives you.;5
"The location was superb. It was a beautiful hotel with a fairly accommodating staff. The late check out options were a bit bizarre. We requested a 2 PM late check out which they declined. It was a long shot so I am not mad they could not accommodate but they offered a bizarre option to get 3 PM check out for $75. We could have gotten another night for only $100 so it seemed a bit steep to offer 4 additional hours for 75% of another night cost. Like I said I am not going to mark them as bad for not offering the option but the cost to ""buy-up"" was a little steep considering the price of the rooms available.  The hotel was gorgeous. They are remodeling the hotels facade so that is something to consider but the interior feels like you are stepping into a 1920's lobby with a bunch of";4
My wife and I have just returned from 6 nights in the Wyndham New Yorker booked through a package deal.  The hotel is ideally located for anyone wanting to travel around the city, with Penn station across the road and its easy access to anywhere.  The hotel is undergoing some refurbishment yet the hotel lobby is still very grand. The Art Deco décor throughout the hotel is plain to see, even in the rooms where the bathrooms have period feature vanity sets.  The room we had was a standard double, and was very small. Enough room for two suitcases, the bed and our shoes, however the room was essentially only for sleeping in as the city was the main reason for visiting.  The hotel has two eateries connected to it, an Italian (that we did not try) and the 24hour Tick-Tock diner. Both;3
The hotel is one block from Penn Station, handy if you are arriving by RailLink from Newark Airport. Steps from Madison Garden and the beginning of the High Line. This Grande Dame from the 1920s has been carefully renovated and updated. We had a view of the Hudson and the glittering lights of the Big City from our window. The staff were welcoming and attentive. The price was just right.;5
Stayed here again for a weekend in the city. This stay was just as good as the first trip.  The room was a little more modern and slightly bigger than the last one we had.  We were on the 27th floor again.  The staff was extremely professional and friendly.  Check in and out was quick.  The baggage hold is still $2.00 per bag.  The beds was very comfortable. Standard rooms have safes, flat screens, hairdryers, basic toiletries, but no refrigerator or microwave. If you ask for a coffeemaker, they'll bring it. There was an adequate amount of electrical outlets.  We heard no noise from any rooms or the hallway.  The location of this hotel is perfect.  NJ Transit and Amtrak are right across the street at Penn Station.  The Subway is at the corner and the LIRR is across the street at;5
Wyndham LAST MINUTE stay!  I used my app and reserved this room in a matter of seconds.  It was late and I was TIRED!!!  The service was great.  I was upgrated to a room with an awesome view of the Empire State Building.  I was also offered a late check-out, which was greatly appreciated.  I would have given 5 stars but the walls are VERY thin and I heard more than I wanted.;4
We stayed here for a few nights recently and it was a very relaxing trip. The hotel is very well located for Madison Square Gardens and served by subway and rail stations. It is a short walk to the empire state building and times square and all told it's a brilliant location.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  The room was small but adequate and it was well serviced and very clean. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again next time we are in the city. One thing, when you stay do take the short escalator ride down to the lower lobby and visit the small museum display that shows the history of the hotel as it only takes a short time to get around the display but it is well worth the effort!  Of particular fascination to me (as an engineer) was the fact;4
Staff very helpful. Beautiful lobby and rooms very clean and roomy. Would def stay again. Attached to the Tick Tock cafe which is the best for breakfast. Amazing location. Impressive all round and very reasonable in prices.;5
"Overall not a bad stay.  Rooms are older but adds to the ""charm"" rooms are very small.  Bathrooms - no counter space, water pressure low, felt like you are taking a shower with a garden hose. Toilet paper is behind the door, which is inconvenient at 2am!  The rooms are noisy, not sure where or what the noise was just a lot of banging and knocking. They are also very warm, but the windows open.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  The location is good.";3
Stayed in the hotel as a child in the 60's. So glad the hotel reopened, and was as cool as I remember. The lobby and lifts are so cool. The rooms were very modern and the bathrooms just the same. So cool! Location was fantastic. Price was very reasonable. Lobby diner was great for breakfast!;5
"We just stayed in the New Yorker (a Wyndham hotel) on 8th Avenue in Manhattan for four nights. What a wonderful stay! The hotel is a historic building (Nicola Tesla lived there for quite a while!) which has been tastefully updated. I have seen other reviews rating the rooms as ""tired."" I can only speak for our room, which is was just fine--clearly an older room but very clean and maintained with respect. If you want hyper-modern, this place is probably not for you, but we liked the whole ambience very well. For example, we really liked the older style of the bathroom, with fixtures that fit the history of the building. The staff could not have been more helpful--they all clearly take pride in their hotel, and they should. The lobby is, I would say, medium grand. The location is";5
"I booked the hotel through Hotel.com and pre-paid for the room, in the description, it stated free wifi. But when I checked in, I was told there will be ""facility charge"" for using the internet, phone, business center and fitness center. When I raised the question about the charges, the front desk woman responded with arrogance and rudeness. I declined the service and didn't use any of the facilities nor the wifi but was still charged for it at check out time. I heard the same complaint from other customer while I was checking in. Apparently, this hotel has mis-led other customers with the false promotion practice too. I have stayed in other Wyndham hotels before and hadn't been charged for this fee. If the hotel charge this fee then they should not advertise free WiFi. I will";2
We spent 4 fabulous nights at this beautiful old hotel in a great location to explore the city.  True, as some people have said, the rooms are quite cosy but they are perfectly acceptable when you don't really need to spend much time in them.  There is great storage and a lovely bathroom with old but clean and beautifully preserved fittings and an unlimited supply of hot water and a really powerful shower.  The room was clean and housekeeping looked after us so well, keeping the room looking pristine while we were out and about.  Free wifi even up on the 37th floor was a godsend and good security by the elevators meant we always felt safe while we stayed there.  Kristal, on reception, welcomed us and was very kind and friendly.  I tried to ask the Concierge for help once but;5
Charges a bit expensive, clean bright, most of the staff helpful, very central,  macys is very close and restraunts are nearby  nice clean rooms, no tea making facilities,  Tick tock dinner is great but really buzy,;4
Once we got to the hotel we couldn't fault it at all. When we arrived there was no ques at the reception desk so we were taken care of straight away! The security at the lifts made us feel so safe in the hotel. There was plenty of lifts available and there was never really any delay with them. Our room was on the 28th floor. The room was nice with a double bed, television set, desk, bathroom and a safe in the wardrobe. We had plenty of towels in the bathroom and the shower was also lovely and warm each morning. The hotels location is amazing!! It's across the road from Penn Station and only down the road from Macy's and the Empire State Building!  We stayed for 5 nights and loved every minute of it. Would gladly return here again and would highly recommend it!;5
Very tired hotel: rooms are very dingy and in need of massive upgrade. When I was there last month, I was upgraded to a big room. However, even this above average room needed a refurb. Finally, my bathroom was infested with roaches - yuck!!  Finally, they sneakily charge a facility fee of $30 + tax on a daily basis and I only found out about this fee at the time of check-in. Not cool!;2
I stayed here recently with my daughter. Check in was good, staff were very pleasant and welcoming. Our room was a Queen room on the 23rd floor. It was small but appeared clean and as we didn't intend to be in it very much, we were happy with it. We went out for dinner and then decided to have an early night as jet lag overcame us.  We had been asleep for about 15minutes when we were woken by a very loud noise which was ongoing, sounded like a large amount of water pouring onto the wall of the room. I have never heard such a loud noise in a hotel room from something outside of my room. We decided that we couldn't tolerate it, phoned reception and were allocated another room on the 29th floor. We weren't particularly happy at having to repack and move but had no other option. The;3
We have stayed at the New Yorker a number of times.  The staff are friendly, especially at the front desk and cannot do enough to make our stay enjoyable.  The rooms are comfortable, large enough for our needs and extremely clean.   You cannot beat the location- five minutes to Maceys and Times Square, across the road to Penn Station, a short walk to the bus terminal which will take you to Woodbury, a good range of cafes and restaurants and good food at the Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel. I will not stay anywhere else in New York and we are picky.;5
The hotel is nice it's old school clean.  The customer service was great.  Except for the people that actually make sure you are a guest they don't remember you they always make sure you have a key and if you are carting food and your hands are full they do not even bother to help you not cool.  They don't even offer to help you with your luggage.  That part sucks there unfortunately.  The maids are great they help you more then the people downstairs friendly.  The conceair service sucked not friendly no discounts.  It seems like they are desperate to sell tix to shows, bus tours and boat tours,  We bought a boat tour that took us along to see the bridges and the Statue of Liberty it was awesome but the customer service said it was a couple blocks down the street nope it was;3
"When we went to check-in, Mohamad noticed that my husband didn't look well. He asked if he was okay?  I answered he's not feeling well. We have a medical appointment at NYU Langone tomorrow "" Mohammad spoke to Housekeeping to find us a room immediately so we didn't have to stay in the lobby. He is such a professional, and represents Wyndham extremely well. Please give him our thanks.";5
This hotel was booked as part of a package so had no choice on it. Stayed in December and was my first visit to New York. Very friendly and helpful check in staff. The room was small but had all that was needed. Powerful shower and could store all our luggage for a cruise on the way back. The doormen and security checking at the lift always had a smile.  The location is second to none and everything is in walking distances. We arrived via Penn station which was 2 minutes walk away, would stay here again.;5
I know that in NYC, EVERYTHING is EXPENSIVE however, The size of this room was so small for the price I paid.  The view out of our window wasn't terrible at all as we could see something's other than a building! There is a parking lot that is a block away which was very nice.  MSG is also a block away. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were clean. The lobby has free cell phone charging stations - just walk in and sit if you need a quick charge! Metro entrance and stop is a block away. I would book here again.;4
Ok so if you like history, the New Yorker is for you. It's cool, old New York style. The rooms remain in that old style and while you can definitely see the wear and tear on the hotel, it was still charming and clean. The rooms are small, but that's New York. I really enjoyed the Tick Tock next store along with the other restaurant attached too. We got an amazing rate here so for what we paid and the experience we got, I enjoyed it. I will say if you're looking for a more modern, try another Wyndham property just a few minutes away called Tryp which has much bigger rooms designed for groups and families. Stayed there before and that property was great too!;4
We booked with the breakfast but this was a joke, only a bad quality filter caffe, one juice and a Croissant, if you want to have more you have to pay. In one morning a drog addicted come to our table to ask for food an nobody did nothing! Internet suppose to be for free but they charged us for this without to know. At home we discovered another 135 Dollars charge on the credit card, just like that, no idea for what. The room was very small with old furniture. In a windy night you can't really sleep, the windows are very old an making strong sounds. This Hotel is a 2 Star Hotel in Europe, for sure not a 4 Stars hotel. The Air conditionar  was very noisy, hard to sleep.;1
We stayed here for three nights after getting the Amtrak from Canada. Ok the rooms are on the smaller side but completely adequate for what we needed. We had a no frills basic room. But it was clean, always had hot water and plenty of storage space. There was a hairdryer, a/c unit in the room and a safe in the wardrobe.  We didn't have to pay any fees for Wifi etc. They gave us a card when we checked in with how to get the wifi in the lobby of the hotel and also in the rooms.  I believe it depends on the time of year and who you book the room with if you need to pay any fees. They do ask for a swipe of a credit card when you check in but I found this the norm in all the hotels we stayed in on our trip.  We were on the 32nd floor. Our room looked over Madison Square Gardens. We;5
As a Timeshare owner in the Wyndham program we've elected to use our points to stay. The place is a cross between hotel and condo, with all the features of both well done.  We will stay again and again hoping that it stays clean & nice, and easy to get reservations. There are great views from rooftop lounge. Good location near enough to broadway but far enough away to avoid the chaos.  Close to Grand Central Station.  Very friendly staff kudos.;4
"The location of this hotel is awesome.  Right across the street from Madison Square Garden. We were in town 1 night to see the Broadway show Chicago so the location of this hotel was perfect.  We were upgraded to a suite; which was awesome plus we were given a coupon for a free drink in the lounge while waiting for our room.  The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating.";5
Fantastic location!  Less than a block to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station.   Easy walking distance to Macy's, Empire State Building, and Times Square. Rooms are small but clean. Staff takes great pride in making all guests feel welcome. Everyone we encountered was pleasant and nice.  Tick Tock diner is adequate. Only ate there once. Food was good but average. Hotel is an older property with some updates. Highly recommended and we would stay there again.;4
The hotel is based on eighth avenue and is close to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Time Square etc. like everything in New York it is all in a walking distance.   With restaurant row down the street and being on eighth avenue itself allows access to some great food options.   The room is a good size for New York, it was clean and the amenities were well looked after.;4
I haven't visited this hotel but the next time I go, I will make a point of staying here based on my experience of dealing with their Guest Relations Manager Djiby. Seriously amazing thoughtful and kind service.  My friend was staying with another friend at the hotel at the end of November 2016 so I contacted the hotel in advance as I wanted to treat my friend to a special treat for a variety of reasons.  The Guest Relations service my friend received was amazing and I felt truly touched how thoughtful and generous they were not only to my friends but to me as well. Thank you xx;5
"Rooms are small but adequate given the central location. Re-modelling did wonders for the place; 20 years ago it was a real dump based on one stay.  Lots of history displayed in various spots throughout; take a tour of the basement to see among other things the tunnel to Pennsyvania Station.";4
Everyone at the front desk was so friendly and accommodating!!Never before had I ever stayed at a hotel where everyone goes out of their way to help you.  My daughter and I could only stay for one night, and we had just left the cab, and I realized I left my phone in the cab. They were so helpful, everyone!!They all tried to help me call the cab company.  But I remember Gabeena's name. She was so kind! They all were so friendly! I came home and bragged to everyone about The New Yorker!!!;5
We were taking the NJ train into New York Penn Station.  The hotel was located a block away from the station.  Was able to store our luggage with hotel since we arrived in the am and check in was not until 4 pm.  Gave us the freedom to explore the city.   No real bells and whistles in the rooms.  No coffee maker but they had food and coffee in the lobby to purchase.  But the rooms were very clean and nice.    I would recommend this hotel to everyone.;5
"Our room was small, but entirely adequate for our needs. Very clean, it appeared to be recently painted, etc. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It was very nice to be in the excitement of NYC and the activity of 8 th Ave; but even nicer to step inside the New Yorker to relax and have a good meal. And a good night's sleep.";5
2 minutes walk from the train  station,  this art deco hotel is a fantastic base for exploring New York.  Hotel was very cosy in the snow and -10 temp. Room not huge but spotless.  Clean sheets and towels everyday. Staff very friendly.  Would definitely recommend.;5
The staff was very pleasant. Everywhere you went within the hotel someone would say hi and ask how you were doing. the rooms are VERY small, but typical for NYC.;5
First time staying at this hotel. Location good, staff good so what's the problem? This hotel is very very old and no matter how much one cleans , it's just old. Rooms very tiny, not functional or stay friendly. Bed is about the only thing that's from this decade, oh and TV.  Nothing is positioned correctly because of the size.  Bathroom horrible , can't maintain water temperature so you either burn or freeze.  Overall it's not bad because most of NY hotels are worst.;3
The location of this hotel is great. For new york city its perfect. There is a 24hr diner next door and a subway station too. The rooms are comfortable and well equipped. I would definitely stop here again.;4
I love this hotel - full stop.  I love the Art Deco presentation and love the presence that it has on the skyline.  The first time we stayed we got upgraded into a queen suite on the 38th or 39th floor which was amazing - huge suite with an absolutely incredible view of the city and of the Empire State Building.  The 2nd time we went we didn't get an upgrade and just had a small room with no real view which wasn't great at all so we have seen both sides of it.  Despite being a little underwhelmed 2nd time round I would without hesitation stay here again because of location location location.  I've always preferred the west side of manhattan and you are just minutes from penn st station which has a lot of key subway routes for getting around - ABC & 123 - (not to sound like;4
I like the style of room and decorations but rooms were small. The completely tiled shower was nice as well and had plenty of hot water, needed after being out in the chilly November air of New York. The lobby is also very pretty and brings you back to what it must have been like a long time ago. We checked out the pictures and information on the history of the hotel as well. Pretty interesting. The hotel had iceskating performances in the past and offered a place to stay for military men coming back from war. Hotel is in great location as well. Close to Madison Square Garden and several blocks from the Empire State Building. New York was a neat place, lots of history. This was our 10th Anniversary trip;4
we stayed here in January for my husbands birthday we had a lovely room on 28th floor we used the Tick tick diner within the hotel which is open 24 hours lovely food brilliant friendly service Joseph who served us daily was lovely so friendly explained menu and had a smile for everyone . Most of the staff friendly and helpful Italian restaurant service not as good they could learn from Tick Tock staff;5
Stayed here 4 nights in December in a un-refurbished Metro double room (2x double beds).    The hotel is well placed at the junction of West 34th St and 8th Avenue.  A large number of subway access points if that is how you intend to get around.    Most of the must see places are easily accessible on foot indeed the Empire State Building is only 10 minutes away, Madison Square is less than that (5mins).    Housekeeping kept the rooms clean and tidy and bedding was changed during the stay.    Suppose the question of whether I would return is definitely but might look to stay in a better quality room, but that would depend on cost as you only there to sleep;3
"I just checked into the New Yorker Wyndham that is supposedly a 4* hotel but looks like a 3* hotel and provides services of a 2* hotel. To use the wifi, the gym, and to be entitled to ""free"" international and domestic calls, the hotel imposes a MANDATORY resort fee of $29+tax. What?!?!?! Who needs free international and domestic calls these days??? This is upselling to the superlative degree! I am a frequent NYC visitor and stayed at many hotels in Manhattan and the Wyndham New Yorker is nowhere close to being a 4*. The carpets on the room floors are dingy, my room and the bathroom are so tiny, and definitely looks old. NEVER AGAIN especially with that resort fee. This hotel is nowhere near a resort! Rip off, beware!";1
We stayed over new year, pre cruise. We had a great room on the 37th floor which had excellent views of the Empire State Building and was extremely clean, with comfortable beds and good bed linen. We loved the Art Deco theme and the great location.;5
I like this hotel for the security they provide to their guests. They will not allow you to use the elevator unless you show them the key card. However, this is quite old, my friend was not even impressed upon seeing my room. On my second day, the paint from the toilet bowl stripped off. I reported it to the housekkeping and it took them half day to remove it. I even beg the other lady if I could use other room for my number 2. Go here for the location, but there are other hotels around that is more modern and chic and cheaper.;3
2nd time i have stayed here and both times were great. This time the room was a bit small but it was clean , comfortable , had more than enough storage and an lcd tv and lets face it you don't go to New York to stay in your room. The location is also spot on for lots of sightseeing. It's only a short walk to Empire State Building and Times Square. Penn Station subway is right next to it so any further sightseeing is only a ride away. Tick Tock Diner is part of the hotel and is a good shout for a hearty breakfast to get you going for the day ahead.;5
Love the New Yorker, it is a great old hotel with small rooms and a nostalgic feel.  The location is good for business or vacation.  The Tick Tock diner is 24 hours and sends stuff super fast to your room.    I have stayed there many times.  The rates were more reasonable before Wyndham took them over but I understand the rate hike.  What I don't understand is how they can leave the public areas shabby and outdated.  A nice retro remodel would be good and if I am going to pay the higher rates then give me a reason.  Fix the lights in the NEW YORKER sign outside and make it the grand old hotel it used to be.  I will still stay there, but hope Wyndham is investing too.;4
we stayed for a wk end. very clean. rooms were small but what we expected.  our room had coffee maker. within walking distance to time square.  close to Penn Station and subway. New Yorkers very helpful in giving directions on subway.  we were told on check in extra fee would be waved since we are Wyndham vacation owners. It was not. extra $90.00 was charged:( I have recommended and would stay there again.;4
WOW yet again another fantastic visit to The New Yorker Hotel.   This time our stay took us up to the lead up to Christmas.   Yes the city is very busy at this time of year however its worth paying a little more at this time of the year to get to see all the Christmas lights and the fab Rockefeller Christmas tree.  Like I said this was our 4th visit on the trot and I cant thank all the staff enough at the hotel for everything they do.  Big thanks to Suzie in the hotel concierge, yet again she has helped us get out of a number of problems with our mobility scooter, room offering her expert knowledge of the city to offer us a great stay.  Big shout out to the manager on duty during our stay Dell. Thank you for what you did for us. You will remember us and what you did for me and;5
Great location, very small room and bathroom. With two luggages inside the room, can hardly walk. And there's a incidental charge upon check in. Higher floors has better views. You can hear siren the whole night maybe it's near some hospital or fire station? Staffs were friendly and it's a great experience haha... never stayed in such small hotel before and so antique feel.;3
Excellent stay in a great hotel.  Check in was quick and efficient and we were in our room within 20 minutes (no wait for the elevators - as experienced by some).  Room was small - as expected, but spotlessly clean and warm.  Bathroom again small but clean.  All the staff we encountered from check in, concierge, housekeeping and security were cheerful, friendly and helpful.  Hotel in a very central location, easy to walk to all major attractions and with a subway entrance on both corners what more could you want.;4
Me and my girlfriend stayed here for the weekend and it was just a bad experience. I really don't ask for much in a hotel, I'm very low maintenance and easy to please, so when I say this place sucked take my word for it. When checking in, we waited about 20 minutes for a receptionist. We were charged an extra $30.00 per day for hotel amenities  ( international calling/gym...which we didn't use once), and then given the wrong room. After calling we got moved to the right room, which was insanely small. The room was bare with nothing but a tiny t.v, the bathroom was even a disappointment. In the shower it took fifteen minutes of messing with the knobs to get it to a bare-able temperature, then fluctuated from freezing to scalding the entire duration. If I had to find something;1
Upon arrival we were quickly & efficiently checked in. As we were in New York for my 30th birthday we had a free room upgrade to a room with a view & vouchers for a complimentary breakfast at the tick tock diner. Before arrival I was advised of a £45 per night incidental charge but this was just held on the credit card, not taken, what wasn't expected was the non refundable $29 + taxes per night service fee, which for WiFi that dropped frequently & a gym we didn't have time to use we thought this was quite steep.  Our room (2435) was a corner room on the 24th floor, it was a good size with a fantastic view of the Empire State building & Madison Square Gardens to the right. The room was clean & the bed was comfortable, the curtains are blackouts & keep the room really dark in the;3
room was extremely small - shower was not updated - beds were way to small - I hung off the mattress - top 1/2 of the room was 72 degrees while bottom half of the room was freezing -  just wasn't comfortable for the price felt more like a cardboard box then a room.;3
We wanted a view, so paid extra for the upgrade to a higher floor. We were very pleased.  The view was great! The history of this old, historic hotel is fascinating. Take time to check out the basement display. The location of the New Yorker is excellent. We chose a tour bus to get around and were able to catch it right across the street. We've been to NYC several times and this was a great hotel in Manhattan. Can't wait to come back.;5
The hotel is well located in Manhattan  The best thing I liked was that I was provided with a Keurig machine and coffee when I asked for coffee. I was not impressed with the rest of the service. I called to ask for a shower cap and a shaving razor, but they never showed up. I called after waiting for 15 minutes, and they still didn't show up. After 1 hour, I gave up. There was hair in the plastic cups in the bathroom- see photo, and hair on the towel. Housekeeping should tie up their hair. The rooms are very small and not soundproof at all. I heard the full conversation of the lady on the phone next door.  There is no space in the bathroom to put a makeup bag or any toiletries, or to hang your clothes.;2
Room was clean but the shower is tatty needs refurb.the lift is slow 5 or 6 lifts but only 1 working for big hotel. people not happy as we have to wait for 15 minutes if ur lucky.. staff are friendly and helpful. restaurant adjoining ok reasonable prices.;4
Terrific stay at the New Yorker - what a historic hotel! We really enjoyed the history display in the basement and just being in such a place. The hotel has been renovated nicely and the staff was courteous and helpful. We were quite comfortable and will definitely come back. Thank you!;4
We arrived on Monday and was greeted by Mohammed who checked us in. He knew we were there to celebrate my 40th birthday. Therefore he upgraded our room so that we would have a great view. Which we had of the Empire State Building, he also gave us free breakfast vouchers for the tick tock dinner. This hotel is amazing and the decor is fabulous. The staff especially Mohammed couldn't do enough for us to make my birthday and stay the best ever. I most certainly will be returning. The location is excellent with penn station right across the road.;5
I've been to NYC several times and know from those experiences that I don't stay in the room very much. So, as long as I have a clean place to sleep, shower and use the bathroom, I'm fine. I chose The New Yorker because of its proximity to Madison Square Garden as I was in town for the Billy Joel concert. I brought my 71 year old mom with me for her very first visit to the Big Apple. I mentioned that it was her first visit in my online reservation hoping that the hotel would give her some special welcome or something. Well, they did by giving us a free room upgrade and allowing us to check in 4 hours early. From the front desk, to security, to the bellman, and everyone else involved, these folks made our short stay absolutely perfect. When I go back to New York, I know where;5
This is the second time we have stayed in the New Yorker. Superbly situated for Empire State, Macy's, Time Square, Subway etc etc. The High Line starts a couple of blocks away for a lovely walk to Chelsea. Hotel very comfortable and friendly.;5
This was our 1st time in New York and we couldn't have stayed in a better Hotel. The New Yorker is so Central a perfect location ..we were so well looked after by one member of staff in particular, Samira, nothing was a problem to her ..the Tick Tock diner does a great breakfast that sets u up for the day .. a great Hotel cant wait to go back ☺☺☺;5
If you want a boring hotel - don't stay here. If you want a hotel where you could be anywhere in the world, don't stay here. If you want a hotel where everything is on your doorstep, don't stay here.  This magnificent Art Deco hotel, first opened in 1929 is amazing. Not immaculate, but exciting at every turn. The rooms are spotless and a good size with excellent views across New York. Each floor brings back memories of what it must have been like over the decades including a potted history in the basement.  We found reception (Shamagne was lovely) very friendly and efficient, while the concierge and security  were cheerful and helpful.  Being on 34th and 8th, the subway was on the corner, although we walked nearly everywhere, including to and back from Times Square every day of;5
Went back after visiting in 2015 for Thanksgiving. We got the most beautiful room. Samira was so helpful from start to finish & really looked after us. She changed our trip. We probably won't stay anywhere else in New York now. :);5
This Art Deco hotel is in a fantastic location in between 34th street and 8th avenue. The hotel is lovely and our room on the 31st floor was spacious and the bathroom clean and fresh but what we loved about our room was it had an amazing view of the Empire State Building further down 34th street. Also close by is Macy's (amazing at Christmas). We had breakfast on a couple of occasions at the tick rock diner in the hotel which was very good but does get busy. We also used the hotel bar which had a good selection of drinks and whisky and not too expensive. If I get the chance to return to NYC I will probably stay here again.;4
We arrived at 5pm and still had to wait an hour for our room. Booked a room with either empire state building or river, didn't get it, requested extra sheets and blankets we were told they were in high demand they will deliver it later....never happened. Bathroom very uncomfortable with one tiny shelf to put your cosmetics and toilitries.  Rooms very clean and spacious with a walking closet.;3
This was our second stay at the New Yorker, again in a suite. For two adults and two teenagers, this is a great option. This suite was larger than the one we previously stayed in. It was on the 34th floor with amazing views over NYC and the Empire State Building. The suite (3420) has a large square hallway, with walk in wardrobe/cupboard, lounge, large bathroom and large bedroom with two double beds. My mother-in-law and father-in-law also stayed at the hotel, but their room, being a double, was much smaller.  The location is fabulous for seeing all the main attractions and staff were friendly and helpful, as usual.   A complimentary birthday cake was sent to our room for my sons’ birthday during our stay, which was a nice touch.   Our visit coincided with the elections and;4
The New Yorker is perfectly situated for those arriving or departing out of Penn Station as it is a short block away. It is also conveniently located to Times Square and other major sites. The hotel staff is professional, polite, and helpful. You can tell they do their utmost best to make an aging property like this one shine. Unfortunately, once you get past the lovely lobby, the hotel is a scary mess. Hallways are straight out of a horror movie. Rooms are tiny (though this is typical in NYC) and rather dingy and dark. Won't be booking here again.;2
This location was great for visiting all of midtown. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go in 30 minutes or less. Its worth it to pay for the upgraded rooms on the higher levels with views of Empire state building.  A couple issues were service was spotty from the front desk. Misinformed and lied to on multiple occasions. That was made up for by the superb management who did everything in there power to make it right.;4
We had a great trip! Taking our son to NY for a coop he was staying at the hotel. The location was great, the room was inexpensive compared to other places in NY, and the staff was great. The room/bathroom we had was small but you should expect that given how old the hotel is. Very good experience.;4
Perfect location and staff from front desk to housekeeping was excellent.  Two minute walk from Madison Square Garden and less than five minutes to Times Square and Port Authority bus station.  Subway next to hotel and Penn station around the corner.   McDonalds and Starbucks along with pizzeria directly across road with another pizzeria (2 bros) a 2 minute walk left of hotel with a pizza slice costing a dollar.  Macy's is also a two min walk so everything is nearby.  Penn station subway takes you to most tourist spots such as world trade ( get off at chamber st station ) and then also Staten Island there you can get to Statue of Liberty.   Hotel was busy but very clean;5
This hotel in the heart of manhattan is within easy reach of Newark international airport by train to New York Penn station which is only across the street The staff are warm and friendly and although the hotel is older than some it is still spacious and comfortable Easy to get around the city from here;5
We stayed at The Wyndham New Yorker on 12/17/16 because we were attending a Billy Joel Show at Madison Square Garden. We normally stay at a different property located in Times Square which although we love it, it was not close enough for this occasion. After reading the reviews of this hotel on TripAdvisor, I decided to give it a try....All I can say is we LOVED IT!! The New Yorker has an old-time charm, our room was clean and comfortable and the convenience of it's location can't be beat!! The staff was very friendly and helpful and we truly appreciated the security checks of our room keys before being allowed into the elevator area!! It was fantastic having the Tick Tock Diner accessible through the Lobby as we went there twice during our stay. I would recommend this Hotel;5
The hotel is classic, modernized but keeping the style of the 1930s. It is centric and really close to Madison Square Garden and Times Square, has a metro entrance on the corner as well. Our initial room was very very small, we have two big suitcases and couldn't fit them in the room, we asked for a change and they helped us get a bigger room without a problem.  The other issue I would point out was that the bathroom WAS FREEZING all the time, and the shower head didn't have enough pressure.  Honestly said, it was a great stay, the only annoying thing was the bathroom. However, if we had stayed in the smaller room, it would have been a problem because of its size.;4
Very good hotel in a good location.  Very good facilities, good area for printing tickets and boarding passes etc. Times square just a couple of blocks away. Madison Square Garden right opposite, NYKnicks, WWE etc. Subway stations right outside. Easy walk down to the Hudon to check out the museum and get the tourist ferry. Integrated diner, tick tock and restaurant  trattoria bianca, both very good. If I come back to NY I will certainly use this hotel again.;4
We stayed 2 nights at the Wyndham New Yorker at 34th Street in Manhattan.  Because it is near Grand Central Station, getting there is easy.  In addition, the subways to are close by, so getting around the City was no problem.  The room was adequate for our needs.  The staff of the hotel, especially the Concierge, was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to take the time to make sure we understood. When you return to the hotel, security checks to make sure you have your room key before you may enter the elevator area. Good work!   There are several, good, reasonably-priced restaurants and take-out places within easy walking distance.  For a short stay, this hotel was fine.  We will be back. U;5
Very historic hotel in a great location.  Rooms are TINY, two of us can literally hold hands and touch the walls.  Bathroom is so far as to be non functional.  Our window was extremely drafty (and this was in the middle of a blizzard). The hotel didn't do anything at all to rectify this even though we asked twice.  Poor internet and they charge $90 for incidentals up front.  Bad management - stay away (but go check out the history).;2
Made our stay in New York! Location was excellent, directly outside Madison square garden and a 5 minute walk to Macy's/5th Avenue.View from our room was the Empire state! Tube station close by. Easy to get both uptown/downtown Manhattan.  Staff very friendly, needed help/directions getting to our Yankee game in which they were more than happy to help with.  Diner below served lovely and reasonably priced meals, great for a quick bite before you head.   Would 100% recommend this hotel, suitable for all ages.;5
"3 night stay for husband's 50th birthday.  Paid addt'l $200 for ""Romance Package"". Didn't receive anything that was promised until the next day. Hotel smells moldy. Staff less than helpful. Would not recommend.";1
Let's just say this is a hotel for party animals. My boyfriend who had just travelled 18 hours from Kuwait and I stayed here dec 26th on the 24th floor which was a disaster. First of all, the room was tiny and dingy. Every corner you peeked in on the outside had a hidden room. We were kept awake all night by party animals especially a couple who was fighting next door. It was so bad where I had to call the front desk multiple times since I thought someone was dying. This noise went on for a few hours until the police finally came to escort the couple from the hotel. No sleep and even with such inconvenience, the only thing we were given was an extended check out at 4pm and 2 breakfast coupons valued at 9.99 each. We were promised by Michael Simms who's the member service manager;2
I booked this trip through Expedia, including combined airfare and hotel from Sunday January 1st-Friday January 6th for about $1200. I thought that was an excellent deal! We booked economy and standard room, as I had read reviews online stating that The New Yorker would upgrade you for free if they had the rooms available. That is exactly what happened. We went from a standard room without a view and we upgraded for no extra charge to a Metro room on the corner with 2 windows and a view of the Chrysler/ Empire State building- thanks Krystal! The hotel is a classical art-deco from the 1920's. Although it has been well maintained, as with another period design from that era, it's small compared to todays standards. I am not complaining, our room was average sized with a small;5
We checked into The New Yorker Hotel for four nights.   Having read the reviews on TripAdvisor, I was a little leery when I checked in and asked for a renovated room that was not the smallest as high up as possible. The desk clerk said she was upgrading me at no charge. I never found out what I was being upgraded to, but I very much enjoyed the room.  The room was small. I looked on the floor plan for fire evacuation on the door and realized that our room (3338) was not the smallest, but nearly.   The furniture was reasonably new with metal edges to prevent scratches and the drawers were wood of good quality. The bed’s headboard was a bit weird, but I realized that the bed had been placed in front of the double windows, and they had finagled with it to make it secure and not hit;5
We have stayed at this hotel before so this review is kind of based on two visits. Let's start with the big plus, Penn Station is across the road so getting two and from airports is a breeze unless you fancy having a laugh with the bus driver and conductor on the airport shuttle. Now thats out of the way lets move back to the hotel itself, when you walk in the first thing that grabs your attention is the huge chandelier which dominates the main reception.  This hotel is very art deco and they have gone to great lengths to make sure it stays that way. The staff are brilliant and very welcoming and the bar which is just to one side of the reception is great for (NYC) people watching. As you walk through the corridors to your room you get a feeling of old style and warm comfort,;5
Before arriving and after reading reviews, I thought about getting ready to ask to upgrade our room as soon as we checked in so that we would have a view, however, after being told that we were on the 33rd floor, I thought we'd go and see the room first.   The room was very small but it did what we wanted/paid for (and we only used it for night - didn't spend much time in there at all!). I was pleased that we had a glimpse of the city, not just the side of another building, although no landmarks visible but that's fine.   The lobby is gorgeous and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. Location is perfect. 10 min stroll to Times Square, under a minute to MSG and very close to fifth avenue shopping and Macy's!   First time to NYC from England and we're so glad we found this;4
I have stayed at this hotel for 5 times now, every visit has been great. I would recommend you to ask staff for advise to help make the trip as good as possible, I have contacted staff a number if times and they have been great. They organised travel for me to events in New York and New Jersey.  Excellent location, near station, Times Square (4 minutes walk) and most central manhattan attractions. Underground stops beside hotel. Easy access from Newark airport.  Good price for a hotel so close to everything, 5 star.;5
Even though it's not quite what I would classify as a 4 star hotel, the location makes it a a great place to stay while you're visiting Manhattan. Front desk was very accommodating, gave us a great upgrade. (Don't be afraid to pay for the upgrade, it's worthwhile). The Bell staff checked our bags until the room was ready. We had a huge suite on the 38th floor with wonderful views of the Empire State Building. It was really easy to walk to the Park, Times Square, 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Centre, etc, Had a manhattan at the Hotel Bar and lite dinner. Really couldn't ask for more without spending a lot more money. Highly recommended!;4
This hotel was very easy to find, and close access to the subway. It was just the two of us staying, and I booked the hotel through Expedia after reading a good mix of reviews, and I was pleasantly surprised. The room is on the smaller side, and it was fine for us as we had minimal luggage, but the bathroom didn't have a counter. There was just a small glass shelf, so it was a little difficult to do the morning hair and makeup routine without juggling a little. I also had to crack the door open while showering, because the steam had no outlet and would gather dew on the ceilings and drip on you after. Otherwise, our bed was comfortable, heat and a/c worked great, and our room was away from the elevators so it was pretty silent. Views all depend on the room you get, we were on;3
BAD SERVICE. We arrived at the hotel 30 mins early from the check in time and having catched an early flight the last thing I want is to get treated rudely. The female staff who checked us in was rude to begin with and when I went up to her again (2.50pm) to check if the room will be ready by 3pm she replied me you are early, come back later maybe 5, 10, 15 min or more. It can be from 3 to 4pm, i dont know you can come back later after 3. All she could do was just answer me politely that the room is not ready and she will give me the room as soon as it is ready. I felt like I was checking in to some budget hotel and since I wasnt the one who made the booking, I was shocked to realize I was in a FOUR star hotel. Being tired, I waited for check in time and went to another staff;3
Right in the heart of everything! Close to train and subway transportation but there were many attractions within walking distance.;4
I have to say that the Experience we had on this hotel was really bad, we expected a completely different service, the room was way too small, when we did the check in the lines were so long and they took so much time just to give us our room The location and the cleaness are the best things of the hotel. So if you are coming to the New Yorker, you better think it twice, because the relation between price of staying here and the true experience you will receive will never worth it;1
Room was clean and comfortable. View from room window was wonderful, the Empire State Building straight in front and because it was close to Christmas was lit up like a present at night. Very centrally located, able to walk to attractions or take a taxi which were reasonably priced. Staff very helpful, pleasant and polite at all times. The attached Tick Tock restaurant served good , honest food with serving staff always having time for a smile and a chat. The doormen very good at procuring taxis outside the hotel.;4
Rooms were way too small. The two beds in the room & dresser was all that could fit in the room. Very little room for any people. Bathroom was exceptionally small too. No vanity or room to store any bathroom supplies. Very disappointed in rooms. Lobby was beautiful.;3
When I travel to NYC I Always stay at this wonderful hotel. Everyone is always helpful and kind. Love this hotel!!;4
Am still at this hotel, it's in a great position close to all sight seeing places, would definitely book here again when I come next time. Food in both the restaurants are very good, the Italian restaurant is more pricey than the tick tick diner. We have a 1 bed roomed suite on the 30th floor, which is very comfortable and well maintained. The views from our room are excellent.  Well done Wyndham New Yorker.;5
The lines were too long at check=in and to pick up your bag being held! Much too long a wait! You must do something about it!;3
"Ok so... just horrible service all around. There wasn't one time it wasn't bad. They booked us twice and we spent hours transferring around departments to get refunded the superfluous charge. The night of, they gave away the room with a view we paid for, so we had a sucky room the first night with no apology but a $10 voucher to the diner (our view-room cost a bit more than that thank you). Every interaction with the staff, whether via phone or in person was shockingly rude, curt, and put off. I'm talking like basic hospitality common sense was totally absent. Oh yeah one time we were stuck in the lobby waiting for our bags. It was Christmas and the lobby was packed. There was no where to sit down and my mom was tired, so she sat in one of the two chairs in front of the ""Wyndham";1
Luxury abounds as you enter The New Yorker Hotel By Wyndham, and you're taken back to a time when glitz and glamour were high class, and you can see from the marble floors, deep mahogany wood, and brass trim, that at one time, The New Yorker was on par with some of the swankiest hotels in all the world. A real architectural masterpiece! These days, the hotel lobby is still beautiful. They have it tastefully decorated with modern seating, albeit too few seats to accommodate the many guests that find themselves stuck there on the floor waiting on there rooms to become ready, or a car to pick them up. They do have several areas to plug in to power your phone or iPad. They have an area to leave your luggage if your room isn't ready, and that's helpful. So don't think you have to;4
We stayed here for 10 days 23rd Dec 2016 to 2nd Jan 2017. The staff were amazing, the room was clean. A little small which is normal for NY. Not much counter space in bathroom. Only concern is that the bathroom doesn't have extractor fans so the bathroom and bedroom windows got very moist. Close to everything. View of Chrysler Building, Empire State and Madison Square gardens was a treat. Stayed in room 2137 which was great for 4 kids and 2 adults. I was given champagne and a voucher to tick tock diner for my birthday. Awesome hotel and service. If they could have a kids room that be great in wet weather to entertain them.;5
What a great hotel for the price and location. Lovely comfortable rooms. Easy to walk to Times Square. Walkable to 5th ave butvwear good shoes. Just across the road from Madison Square Garden and the Subway. Great diner on the corner.;4
"Understaffed, dirty room, worn and torn furniture, unfunctional internet service, rude staff, excuse given at almost every station ""it's the holiday and we are full"". Long lines at the front desk throughout our stay, room reserved not available. The bottom line is that Wyndham should remove their name from this property.";1
We stayed at the New Yorker in early December and were so happy with this hotel! We wanted to be within walking distance of everything without having to pay a fortune and this hotel was perfect. The room was tiny - pretty typical in most big cities - but clean with everything we needed. The staff was great, too. Less than a mile from Times Square, a little over a mile to Rockafeller Center, a few blocks from the Empire State Building and shopping in every direction. I would absolutely stay here again!;5
It was my 3rd stay at this hotel, reason I keep choosing it is that it is strategically located making it easy to travel by subway. Just outside the hotel you could jump on lines A, C & E which by the way also connects to JFK airport. At walking distance you can reach almost all the other subway lines which is a good advantage whether you are in NYC for business or leisure reason.  Times Sq., Macys and Empire State Building are amongst some of the places at walking distance. Tick Tock Diner offers good food and friendly staff. We didn't have any problem with waiting time for the lifts, and all staff is friendly. Hotel though needs refurbishment, mattresses in our room were quite bad and windows fails to isolate you from noise and cold, but I understand that is already;4
We booked three nights in the Wyndham New Yorker for our first trip to the big apple and don't think we could have picked a better hotel.   I originally booked a suite for me, my wife and two teenage kids and requested an upgrade. When I arrived my upgrade had been granted but I didn't get a view and was presented with a neighbouring brick wall when I pulled back the curtain .   A quick trip to reception and Linda sorted for us. With no fuss at all she moved us to stay in suite 2349 which offered amazing views.  My main tip for anyone travelling is to make sure you get your room specified with a view the difference this made for us was amazing. From our room we had views of Madison Square Garden, the Chrysler building and a sliver of the Empire State Building which just made the;5
This hotel is dirty, old and run down. The rooms are tiny even for New York standards and the Bathroom as horrible it was tiny with flaky paint!!! There was no safe in the room which made us worried about things being stolen as there ware always people coming and going out of the hotel.  When in the room the windows were single glazed so the room was noisy from outside traffic and the rooms seems to have little sound proofing also.   DO NOT STAY HERE !!;1
This was our third trip to Manhattan and our favourite hotel so far.  We spent 5 nights at the Wyndham New Yorker during the 2016 Christmas period.  The New Yorker is a beautiful art-deco hotel that must have been the pinnacle of hotels in it's day!  It has been well maintained and the lobby itself was stunning.  We were in a corner suite on the top (40th) floor and had amazing views of the landmark buildings of Manhattan.  Plenty of room for a family of four in this 1 bedroom suite (pull out sofa, and also a roll-away cot fit just fine).  Front desk staff was very professional and the housekeeping staff were very friendly!  Several elevators to take you to your floor so minimal waiting, even during busy times.  Security 24/7 at the elevators and only those showing a room card;5
This hotel is nothing short of amazing! Staff are all superb, beautiful clean spacious rooms and the attached Tick Tock Diner has great food and amazingly polite attentive staff. Cannot praise this hotel enough for making my daughter's Christmas so special! Views from the room of the Empire State, well I'd never tire of waking up to that view! Thank you all again. Will definitely stay here again.;5
We spent 3 nights/4 days here and found it to be comfortable and roomy. There were 4 of us celebrating a graduation. The hotel was conveniently located so that we were able to get around easily. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We ate in the restaurant and had a drink in the bar area. Our room was clean and pleasantly decorated. Our stay there was most enjoyable!;5
I traveled with my friends to NY & our stay at the New Yorker was very comfty.  The hotel staff was very friendly.  The hotel itself was very clean, housekeeping staff was visible daily.  Overall, a great stay close to tourism places.;5
We stayed in a 2x Double room in October 2016.  Arrived at just after 2pm, and walked straight up to a free receptionist, were expecting to be told that couldn't check in yet  but had a look and checked us in right away.  We had a room located on the 34th floor and were amazed by the stunning views, we had three windows looking in two locations, two over the street and one with views across the river, as good as the views were during the day were jaw dropping at night.  The room had two double beds, a cabinet with shelf between the beds, a three drawer chest of drawers, a small desk with a couple of drawers and a massive walk in cupboard with safe.  Storage wise was great, we had two big cases and three smaller bags, comfortably got all out stuff unpacked, cases etc. In the;5
Booked for 1 Week Stay Friday 9th to Friday 16th December. Nice Hotel. Room bit Small for Double on 30th Floor. A View of The City from Window. Ideal location for Subway and Madison Square Gardens...Macy's Department Store and Close Proximity to Empire State Building and Flat iron District. Penn Station is Beneath Madison Sq Gdns. Access to Airport easily by Subway or Overground Train. Nice Hotel but like Most Hotels in New York quite pricey for Room Only. Xmas may have bumped price up slightly but I think NYC in general Hotels quite on Dear side. Enjoyed stay...;4
Stayed a few nights in October and the location worked well for many attractions.  Rooms are good. Compact, clean & comfy. We had an awesome high floor view across the sunset to The Statue of Liberty.  Nice atmosphere in the lobby & bar.  Would consider staying here again.;4
This hotel is just a block from Penn Station in NYC.  They have maintained the historic look and feel of the hotel.  The room was small but clean and i got a better deal when booking on the web page than I was offered when I called.  Would definitely stay there again.;5
This was our first holiday to the states, the hotel room was really small not big enough for three adults, Staff not very helpful it was the wife's Birthday when we were there front desk staff said they would send a bottle of champagne to the room, before we went on the holiday we sent about 4 emails asking for some info I even asked about organising a birthday cake but we had no response from hotel. The only guy that replyed was John on the transportation desk he organised a car to pick us from the airport and then he got us back to th airport, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone,;3
What a fantastic hotel! We could not be happier with the first stop on our honeymoon. Once they found out we were on honeymoon they upgraded our room to a suite with a perfect view of the Empire State Building. The staff are so friendly and nice. John in the concierge will go out of his way to ensure you have the best time on your visit. The location is so central you can pretty much walk everywhere of interest. We will definitely stay there on our return trips.;5
"A lovely 1930 Art Deco style hotel that fell into disuse in 1972, was sold to the Unification Church and has subsequently been refurbished a couple of times. It is an iconic building and the refurbishments in the original style are very nice. Staff were friendly and the room clean and neat, although small, as is usual in NYC. The hotel is centrally located opposite Penn Station, close to the Holland Tunnel and within walking distance of many Manhattan sights. There is a convenient parking garage on 33rd St. if you don't want to use valet parking service. We had a nice view of the Empire State Building too, which was an unexpected bonus.  There is a small fitness center in the basement and a ""museum"" which is really only a series of pictures and a few artifacts placed around the";5
"The check in process was horrendous. It took 45 minutes standing in line. The service in both restaurants in the hotel was awful. The staff was rude at both restaurants...one waiter even began taking the menu out of my hand while I was still ordering. Everything was busy with it being close to Christmas, however that is not an excuse; there should have been more staff on hand (the hotel was not prepared at all). I have never in my life seen guestrooms as small as the ones in this hotel (photos online are incredibly misleading). It said they had been redone yet it was the oldest looking bathroom and room I have ever stayed in. The whole property just looked old. The water in shower was not easy to work and would not get cool causing my daughter to get burnt. The pillows on the";1
We arrived from Scotland on Dec 22nd for Christmas .  Prior to arrival the hotel had kindly agreed to leave a note from Santa on the pillow of our young daughter.  They went beyond this and a gift was also left on her bed along with a sign on her door from Santa.  The room with a view is a must have and is worth the extra money staying in this magical city.  The rooms are small but warm and comforting after a busy day.  The hot watet is instant and air con perfect.  The staff have been 1st class at all times and having security at the elevators so only guests may come and go is ideal. Special mentionmuu go to Emily for all her kindness throughout.  The Tick tock diner is attached to the lobby and is open 24 hours.  Food is good and reasonably priced too.  With Madison square;5
Stayed here 5 nights on night number one me and my friend got sick after having a shower, the hotel provide drinking cups inside the bathroom assuming the water is drinkable no signs no nothing advising otherwise, no bottled water provided no mini fridge the water is thick brown dirty dirty water!! 4/5 nights of our holiday that we paid $1500 for to stay at this hotel we wer sick in bed absolutely disgusting after complaining to staff nothing was done they don't really care TBH! Rooms are small beds uncomfortable staff very rude not worth the money at all   Still awaiting the mangers response;1
The location is great....very close to everything... Access from the JFK airport is 1h approximately (Airtrain + Line E) Rooms are a little small but when it's only for sleep, it's convenient. Tick-Toc cafe was good...pancakes are awesome...mmmmmm Luggage storage is a bit expensive....$2 per piece of luggage ($1 when dropping them off, $1 when collecting them) Front desk is very helpful and gentle...security is present and make you feel safe within the hotel;4
This was a beautiful hotel and a great location walking distance to just about everything. Our room was fairly large and comfortable for four people nice amenities. The beds are not the most comfortable but not horrible either.;4
I arrived at the hotel at 8:30 am and was exhausted from traveling and not sleeping all night.  The staff is very organize and immediately arranged to hold my luggage so I could go to the adjoining restaurant for breakfast.  Just before noon, I received a text from the front desk saying I could check in early!  The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was a bit dated, but it only enhanced the authenticity of the Art Deco vibe.  The hotel itself has a very classic 1920's energy and the location is incredible.  I was in NYC to see Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden and I happily wore my high heels for the less than 5 minute walk to the entrance of MSG.;5
Everyone was so awesome... We arrived to New York on an early flight The New Yorker  stored our bags so we could enjoy the city while our room was getting ready. I wanted a room with a view so they were so gracious to put us on the top floor and boy what a view you could see everything....I had hurt my knee while out and about in the city the man who checked us in listen to our silly story and when our luggage arrived to our room he had ice packs for me so super nice of him to do without even asking. they where so accommodating. all the staff was so nice... OMG the TICK TOCK cafe was so good so nice having it in the hotel.;5
The hotel is in a great location, just a short stroll from Macy's and a 10 minute walk from Times Square. There is a Starbucks opposite for your early morning coffee fix, which you'll need because of all the walking!  The hotel itself is nice, the rooms are a little small, but I think you expect that based on where it is. The staff in the lobby and at the front desk are super friendly and helpful. The rooms can be a little noisy though.;4
We loved our stay in NYC this time around.  Living in NJ, mostly we do day trips, we are glad we stayed in Ciry and chose Wyndham New Yorker.  What an amazing history this hotel has, didn't know it was the first hotel to have 3200 phone line and with 95 operators back in 1930's when it opened, largest in the world at the time.  It was a global village with everything under one roof from hospital to Chappell to laundry to restaurant, etc.   great location, right outside of Penn station and Maddison Square Garden.  Almost all tourist spots of the city in walking distance, anyone looking for a true historic NYC experience must visit New Yorker!;5
The location of the hotel was excellent, as was the cleanliness of our room. The Tick Tock Diner on site made breakfast easy and it had a vast menu, regardless of which meal you were eating. The only comment I would make is that there were no tea & coffee making facilites in the room which would have made the stay a little nicer. But, having said that, we would return and would recommend it to others.;4
We stayed at the New Yorker for one night.  We got a great deal right on the hotel’s website for a suite on a Friday night, which is a plus.  So it had 2 bathrooms, and a separate living room.  That was really great because the regular rooms are small.  It is in need of some desperate updating though.  I don’t mean to say that it is dirty, it is neat and clean.  It just feels like it has looked the same for such a long time, it needs to be modernized.  The one thing that I didn’t like, and it might sound silly, is that the handle to flush the toilets were like the ones in a public bathroom.  To me, that is just not classy for a hotel at all.  Also, the shower heads are terrible.  The water squirted everywhere and the pressure was really hard.  The walls are also paper thin, so;3
The lobby staff was terribly unorganized, not very patient with guests and at some times just rude. When management was questioned about why things were such a mess and disorganized blame was placed on others, no one would take responsibility for anything.;2
Located in midtown, 34th St and Penn St., subway entrance located near front door. Very friendly staff. Security is topnotch. Rooms are small, but who stays in their room while in New York City! Tick Tock restaurant is ok in a pinch. Hotel is old but rooms have been renovated. Very comfortable;4
We went on a 30th anniversart trip to NY with our 2 sons. Very friendly staff, rooms very clean. Our sons room was quite small but on our last night we were upgraded, free of charge, to a corner suite on the 40th floor with the most amazing views in all directions. Thank you Carlos!! Very convenient for all sights. Will definitely go back;5
I picked this hotel because of location and price. It is not a luxury hotel, but it was clean and surprisingly quiet.  definitely stay here again when I return to NYC.  I was upgraded to a room with an amazing view on the 35th floor.;5
We brought our youngest son here for his 18th birthday and stayed at The New Yorker. We arrived on the red eye and since it was only 8am we had the hotel keep our bags for us (no charge) while we had breakfast at the Tick Tock. Great meal! After breakfast the staff informed us our rooms were ready! So great! We settled our things and were off. So many things to see so close by. If you choose to go to the top of the Empire State bldg definitely choose the priority pass that enables you to skip the lines and go right up. SO much faster!! It's crowded up there regardless but such amazing views! We saw a concert at Madison Square Garden, again within easy walking distance. Walked to see a broadway show and never felt unsafe there are SO many people at all times of day/evening that;4
Loved the history this hotel offered. From the beginning of our stay Valet parking was easy check in process was great they let us check in early and valet early which was wonderful being we were going to a 2pm show and wanted to see some of NY before hand. Rooms were very clean and comfortable to sleep. Check out was easy and they held our bags for a small fee while we went out to view NY once again. Breakfast at Tick Tock was good too. I would definitely stay here again!;5
Hotel stay was 2 nights - mid-price range with a coupon code. Hotel lobby, floors and room were clean. Attended an event in ballroom which had a weird 2 floor climb to reach a rest room.  Staff were friendly and helpful. Cons were: 1. Room was tiny including bathroom - small length tub and narrow/shallow sink. Space around bed was no more than 20-26 inches for movement.  2. The elevators are SLOW - wait times of 10+ minutes easily .;3
Stayed 9 nights at this hotel, was the perfect location. Room was lovely & all staff very helpful & friendly. Will use again when we come back to New York & highly recommend this hotel. They have a coffee bar & 2 restaurants joined on. We used both & enjoyed them very much.;5
My wife and I stayed at the New Yorker for a Sunday and Monday night, the week before Christmas.  We booked our room through Groupon and got a very good rate for NYC. The Groupon worked out to approximately $153 a night for everything. The only thing extra was the daily facility fee you pay upon check-in. That worked out to about $30 more a night with tax.  This fee supposedly gives you access to their wi-fi, fitness center, etc...  The hotel is definitely a bit on the older side, but for us it was all about VALUE and LOCATION. If this is your criteria, you can't go wrong!  Pros: Comfortable queen size bed, fast internet, and friendly staff.  Cons: The room was small and the bathroom was outdated and even smaller.  There was a slight cold December draft blowing in from around;4
"First, we love this hotel for convenience, friendly and helpful staff, and value.  We had three rooms and all three were Executive View Queens on the 30th floor.  One had a view of the Empire State Bldg, and the other two were of Times Square/Chrysler Bldg area.  The staff was fast and helpful at check-in.  They called to make sure the requested refrigerators were in the rooms, and when they werent, they were immediately sent.  Yes, I have stayed in larger rooms at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square, but also paid higher prices. The staff at the New Yorker made you feel ""a part of it"" and we love the retro feel (with the nice upgrades including heated bathroom tiles).";5
With so many amazing options for places to stay in NYC, this is not a place I would choose to stay again.  Macys is right around the corner, but we were always wanting to be closer to Rockefeller Center or Times Square for shopping and dining. Getting an uber was a big waste of time and money in the winter months when everything we wanted to do was too far to walk in the freezing weather.  The rooms...so tiny! I paid $200 per night for a tiny dated, old room with one QUEEN bed to share.  I have never seen a one bedroom room with a Queen bed, it should have at least had a King.  We had just enough room to walk around the bed, but with our 2 large bags on the floor (the closet was not large enough to lay out one bag) we were very cramped.  There was a tiny window with view of a;3
It's a nice, clean, safe, reasonably priced hotel in New York with a 24 hour diner, so for those reasons alone, I have to recommend it.  Like all hotels, it's great for some visitors and not great for others.  If you are comfortable using the NYC subway, this is  good hotel for you. There's a good station right cross the street that you can use as a great starting point.  If you want to see an event at Madison Square Garden or need to use Penn Station, this is  great choice - MSG is less than 1 block away.  If you want to shop at Macy's or visit the Empire State Building, this is a good hotel.    If you aren't comfortable using the subway, this might not be  great hotel - there isn't a lot to do or a lot of touristy things in the immediate area - you can't really walk to any of;4
"the New Yorker is conveniently located quite near bus and train stations; Macys dept store.   an extremely safe neighborhood to walk.   The New Yorker is a beautiful well maintained older hotel from the 1920-20's.  The staff, building, and location make it an ideal location for a NY stay.";5
I have stayed here twice when traveling to NYC from West Virginia. Extremely clean. Perfect location across from Macy's and Madison square garden. Walking distance to all major points such as 5th avenue, Rockefeller, and Times Square. Will never stay anywhere but here! Very affordable. Staff is super friendly and welcoming. Will accommodate to needs. Beautiful views!!;5
We stayed here for 5 nights and really enjoyed the handy location. It was a quick walk to the Subway, bus or train. Due to its location we walked to a lot of NYC attractions.  Concierge was very helpful with all our questions about getting to different sports events.  Room was very small and bed was hard but that didn't ruin our experience. As said by others there is no tea/coffee in room but with Starbucks and many other places to grab a coffee near by it was not an issue.  Thanks for a great first time experience of NYC!;3
This hotel is perfectly located, near the Madison Squeare Garden, Penn Station, CVS. Duane Reade, Starbucks. It´s also very comfortable, and has an amazing view of New York City. I was only 3 days and all the staff I met were very nice.;5
Very nice, centrally located to many landmarks. The hotel is over 100 years old, but is restored and decorated in a Art Deco design.  The beds were firm but comfortable. Subway entrance is right by the hotel. The only negative thing is the size of the bathroom, it is cramped and there wasn't much of a counter to set things on. Also, it took over 10 minutes to get hot water in our bath tube.  It is a nice nostalgic old hotel and I would probably stay there again just for the location.;4
Well when we checked in for some reason our reservation was cancelled, we had to speak with a manager and it took hours before it was resolved, but it was only resolved because I had to forward them a copy of my confirmation. My room was super small and outdated. I just wan't happy with my stay at all.;3
My daughter and I have recently spent a week in New York based at the New Yorker and could not have wished for a better place to stay.  The staff were brilliant, nothing was too much trouble and a special mention for the lovely man that runs the history part of the hotel who went out of his way to show and explain about some of the famous people and venues that have occupied the hotel over the years. The location of the hotel is very central and security is good!;4
We stayed at the Wyndham for one day do to the fact that we decided to go to NYC a day early and our other hotel had no availability. For starters they canceled our reservation out of error and when I called to correct the situation I happen to be online and noticed a lower rate. When I mentioned it to the front desk she simply told me she couldn't give me the rate online and if I wanted it to book it myself. No apology nothing. The hallway on our floor was extremely dark and smelled of urine. Our room was clean but extremely dark and out dated, not to mention the front desk told us the room had two queen beds and it actually had two full beds. I personally would not recommend this hotel.;2
We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during the Christmas season. The room was very comfortable, clean and newly updated. The bed was firm but comfortable. The room was small (most NY hotel rooms are) but the space was maximized efficiently. The location was very convenient to Penn Station which was nice because we flew into Newark airport and could take the train to this station and then had a 1 block walk to the hotel. There is a Starbucks across the street (important to us coffee drinkers), however, there was a Keurig Coffee Maker in the room. Empire State Building, Macy's, Madison Square Garden are all close by. The staff were very helpful and made sure that we had what we needed during our stay. For example, our first room was in a poor location and they let us change to a;4
It is a cheap hotel, at least it was for us. We paid about $150 per night.let me start of with the check in, the line was nearly out the door. After you make that insanely long line good luck waiting for the elevator which can take up to 10-15 minutes. When you finally arrive to your room you'll notice a bathroom that is so old the paint is chipping of the tub and all over. The mattress feels 30 years old, hard and uncomfortable. And the pillows hard and small. Wifi might as well be non existent because it is so slow.   On the brighter side, the location is perfect. A block away from the train station and a few blocks away from Macy's. Housekeeping did a good job cleaning the room. They also have a great diner downstairs that has a delicious breakfast. If they would remodel the;2
Great location. Old style, loved it. The rooms aren't 21st century big, they are 1930's luxury, so take that into account. The staff were great, the room was spotless, bed was comfy. Free wifi in the room. I'd use this hotel again. Close to sandwich shops bars and restaurants. Over the road from Penn Station. 3 blocks straight down to Empire State Building.;4
This historic hotel has a beautiful lobby, but long waits for check in and for luggage service. We waited 10 minutes before anyone came to the luggage station, despite other staff telling us it would be just a few minutes. Also, during four different showers, the water was crazy. Flashing between freezing and scorching makes for a very uncomfortable experience. The location is great, and we had a nice view.;3
The location was excellent!  The hotel decor was beautiful but guest rooms and bathroom were tiny. The walls was also paper thin. Very disturbing to a couple trying to sleep in.;4
This hotel is located in the heart of New York.  It has easy access to anything a visitor could want.  It is also a beautiful place to stay - very clean with a great staff.;5
Stayed in the New Yorker in Feb 2013 and been to NYC since and realised what a little gem of a hotel it is   Basic rooms but enough for your needs when in NYC (if you spend too much time in your hotel you are doing NYC wrong)  Beautiful lobby area and great in house Dinner with Tick Tock being great place to start your day (Massive portions!!!)  Location couldn't be better right in the Centre of all of the action, quick walks to times square and the High Line, only time we got subway was going to financial district   Nipped back in when was staying in Dec 2016 and was nicely renovated from when I had prev stayed (made mistake of staying hotel Pen this time, I will be returning to New Yorker on my next visit);4
This hotel has friendly staff and the best location, in Midtown. The Big Bus Tour, Hop on Hop off has a stop across the street. It's a great way to get around during the day. Take cabs at night.  Our room was nice with a view of the river in the distance.   The restaurant bar located in the hotel has great food and drinks. It's a popular place.    Tick Tock Diner located in hotel is average. The food was ok but the coffee was good. The wait staff won't refill your coffee unless you ask and ask.   I liked the coffee and pastry stand outside the restaurant, in the lobby.  We stayed 5 days and will return again.  This is a historic hotel with a small museum giving its rich history.;5
Stayed here for 7 nights in December beautiful room with a great view. The room was renovated with a good size walk in shower. The location is ideal with Macy's on 34th Street and Penn Station and a walk down 8th Ave to Central Park. The service is superb would recommend this hotel to anyone.;5
"The room had been very reasonably priced. The room was fine, clean and comfortable. It 's a very large hotel, so long hallways and waits for elevators, but for the price it's fine except the morning of check out a bill stuffed under the door showed we had a balance of $35.00. We did not buy in-room movies,but used the ""free""internet. Turns out all rooms are charged this 35.00 charge at checkout regardless. So beware the internet is really not free, and even if you didn't use the ""free"" internet you will be charged. So room ended up being more expensive than I had chosen to pay. Very sneaky";3
We were delighted with our room - very large - two double beds and two bathrooms.  We stayed 5 nights and found the location excellent - staff very helpful and restaurant excellent.  Just a block from Macys and near Broadway this is such a central location.;4
We stayed for one night at the hotel, the public area at reception is very nice, our room was nice, the bathroom clean but dated, what surprised us was the size of the room, it was not large but bigger than we expected for a city centre hotel, We ate in the restaurant linked to the hotel at night and in the diner also linked to the hotel in the morning. Both meals were very nice, we thought they were a little pricey but realised later on our trip that the prices were lower than other like places in New York. The staff were friendly and the location pretty good. The public corridor on the floor we stayed was in need of a refresh but all in all it is a pretty decent hotel.;4
Stayed for 4 nights in December and decided to upgrade to a renovated, view room. The room was comparable to a London hotel room in size, but plenty big enough for the 4 nights, with decent size TV and coffee machine. The view of Empire State Building and MSG were excellent, and added to our the experience of our first visit to NYC. The hotel staff were friendly and professional at all times, however the housekeeping team slightly noisy early in the morning. Convenient location for Times Square, Macy's and other NYC landmarks. Would stay at The New Yorker again.;4
"The rooms are updated and the location is ideal...it's a great value in NYC.  Also, the service is superb; everyone is very helpful.  I have stayed at the New Yorker for years, both for business and family trips.";4
Lovely clean hotel, room was very small, but very clean. ( it did the job) with friendly staff. Location was great, near subways and bus stops.Was central walk to Times square and Macy's. Had a fab time.Would stay here again.;4
We had an very good stay at the New Yorker.  It was a very active venue.  Helpful, too, to have a restaurant on premises.  Check in was smooth, room itself was a little small but of that vintage.;4
Great place to stay. Very nice and people were friendly and helpful. Great location in Midtown Manhattan. Already planning a trip back next year. Can't wait!;5
Stayed at The New Yorker for 4 nights In December.  The hotel has a beautiful lobby when you walk in.  Very art deco, it as also decked out for christmas which was lovely.  Check in was very easy,  We were not happy about their daily tax as coming from the UK we would not us the calls and we are centainly not fitness centre users!!  They agreed to reduce it down, which was good.  We also decided to pay for an upgrade to one of their recently refurbished Empire State Building View rooms.  We were so glad we did.  The room was on the 30th Floor and had the view was breathtaking.  We did not really have any interaction with the staff but they all seemed friendly enough.  The other plus of this hotel is the location, its very central and only a 10 min walk to times square and 5 mins;4
The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful without being pushy. The location is fantastic, with 2 subway stops, 2 bus stops, and Penn Station right outside the door. The Tick Tock Diner was a fun place to eat, though not great for quiet conversation. And as good as the food was, the $20 continental breakfast vouchers were not worth the money. We had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building from our updated room on the 30th floor. The bathroom floor was heated! The art deco details are wonderful without being over-the-top. The hotel's museum under the lobby was underwhelming but still pretty interesting and worth a couple minutes.;5
Stayed in a standard room, once- and it was TINY. This past stay, I chose and executive double for only a few more bucks and got a seriously upgraded room. It's like the tale of two hotels! One has all the classic fittings, fixtures, tile work and cramped quarters of a classic hotel- the other is spacious, with modern fixtures. Views can vary, but I was upgraded and pleased with my view looking down 34th St. Service was good, but it's real hard to catch a cab. The lobby is also always busy, but it's in a high traffic area.  Not crazy about the diner food, but you'll take what you can get sometimes.;4
We came to visit all the Holiday sites and lights and sparkle. The New Yorker once again was the PERFECT home base. We were given an early check in and dropped off our bags to begin our tour. I cannot stress enough that this property is top shelf , spotless and a wonderful historic building to explore. The history lines the walls downstairs with gorgeous black & white photos documenting all the famous and infamous that have stayed there. Tic Tock diner is always a perfect stop for any appetite. I look forward to returning to the New Yorker one day soon.;5
This part of 8th Avenue is not the best, but this hotel IS an iconic part of NYC history. Nicollo Tesla lived here (and died here.) I believe JFK was also a guest here. Modern day I think it's a little overpriced for the area of the city it's in,but if you are looking to be close to Time Square, Madison Square Garden, and the Empire Stare Building this location really can't be beat. Just be street smart (even more than usual when walking to and from this hotel.) the restaurant in the lobby is AMAZING and open all night I believe! I recommended this hotel to my dad and he also liked it.;4
This is the 6th time I think we have stayed at this hotel.Perfect location.Beautiful hotel.Staff fantastic.The first room allocated was on 36th floor.Amazing view,but room was too small and bathroom was tiny.At front desk we spoke to Driss who quickly sorted us another bigger room on the 21st floor.Wonderful.;5
We have stayed in this hotel several times during our New York trips. It never disappoints, and is one of our favorite hotels in the New York City area. It's simply classic. The room was extremely clean, and the bed super comfortable. A few sirens and a little bit of noise can be heard, but it is very minimal. One of our favorite hotels, and a New York icon. Will be back!;5
This was such a horrible experience . We came here for our baby moon. The pictures on the website showed images of a beautiful suite so I booked my suite for about 600 dollars a night. When we arrived the room looked nothing like the pictures. The room had a 1950s bathroom, was old, had no cable and did not have the amenities as deceptively depicted on their website.  I went to the front desk for assistance . They tried their best to place me in a better room however the rooms that were shown on the internet were unavailable . I was so dissapointed I called corporate for further assistance however they were absolutely useless I will never ever stay at a Wyndham hotel in my life. Poor business strategy overall on their part because they lose potential life long customers willing;1
Great location - needs an upgrade. Close to most interesting places and shopping Price is good for where it is at - rooms are fairly tight Reception was helpful, as for the rest not really friendly - but that is how New Yorkers are;4
Hotel is average - very old, bed was comfortable. Rooms are small, perfect location though. Wouldn't rate it a 4*, but not sure if 4* English is the same as American. I would say it was a 3*.   Also we asked to keep the room for a couple more hours and they said it was going to be 320 dollars more - which is a joke!   Also when we checked in we were told there is a 25 dollar daily charge for the fitness centre, daily newspapers and for use of the telephones. I did not pay it, apparently it's in the terms and conditions. I didn't use any of the above so I didn't pay the charge, the lady was nice enough and said that's fine.;3
I had a great time staying at The New Yorker...It's a wonderful historic property with a great location, scenic views from the higher level rooms and a very friendly staff. My room was small , but the view made up for the size!;5
I had a deal so I wasn't expecting much and that's what I got. This is an older hotel with an acceptable upgrade but some of the polish is only on the surface. I was stuck in a room in the back of the hotel with a beautiful view of the ventilation shaft and the fire escape. The light from the hallway kept the room nice and bright from the space under the door requiring towels to block the light for sleeping. Rehearsals in the venue next door started at 9am so there was music in the morning.  The room was average size by New York standards but overpriced for what I got. They've installed nice flat screen TVs but only provide a limited number of standard def channels. Like others, I was annoyed by the 'facility fee' added to the bill, mainly for the wifi. This is free in most;3
I enjoyed my stay and the views of NYC. Staff was friendly. The diner connected to the hotel was very good.;4
Just got back from this hotel fantastic.. perfect position to get all of the destinations in New York.. The subways round the corner.. don't be scared to use it it's fine.. you will get a few crazy people but just keep your eyes down and don't talk to them.. I had my two teenage daughters with me I found the city amazing.. The staff at the Wyndham and cannot do enough for you... definitely going back next year at the time of our lives happy holidays;5
"Pros: The location is great for visiting NYC.  Very convenient for train travel to/from Penn Station, and there's an A/C/E subway entrance just a few steps from the entrance.  Con 1: Be prepared to pay an extra $30/night (hidden in the fine print on this site as a ""resort fee"" and called a ""facility fee"" by the front desk) for WiFi and an exercise room, even if you have no need for them.  It's unethical for hotels to advertise a prepaid price and then require you to pay another 10% per night when you show up.  To the manager: Include ALL fees in the advertised price.  Con 2: The walls are very thin and the room wasn't in great shape (peeling paint, etc.)  I was woken up one night by a neighbor throwing up in his bathroom, the other night by young kids screaming for a half hour,";2
I am giving this hotel a very good rating because of the room size but don't stop reading.  I like many other people read all the reviews of many hotels before booking this hotel. We were going to New York to celebrate a birthday and we didn't want to spend all of our money on a room that we were only going to sleep and shower in. We searched all the discount price sites and found several locations that were priced much higher than this hotel but had worse reviews. All the hotels in NY seem to have small rooms. This hotel is the same. The rooms are small but we were in our rooms less than 8hrs a day. That includes sleeping. BTW, the room may be small but the bed was comfortable.     We always had friendly staff greet us. We always had someone checking your room key to make sure;4
Took my wife to NYC for a week vacation on her birthday.  Had informed the New Yorker of the special occasion and was greeted with one of the best rooms and also a bottle of Champagne.  The hotel is almost 100 years old but doesn't show her age, like all grand dames, but does reflect a beautiful Art Deco decor.  The rooms are not as expansive as modern hotels, but that adds to the charm.  We had a small suite, a bedroom and a living room, and on the top floor so we had a fantastic view.  The rooms are updated and modern, the amenities and facilities are excellent, and the staff is fantastic.  We absolutely loved our stay and will definitely return.  The New Yorker is also pet-friendly, although we didn't bring our herd, but will keep that in mind for future trips.  The only;5
We were extremely disappointed with the lack of sound proofing. Doors were opening and closing all night, people hanging out in the hallways and you could hear our neighbor when they would move the hangers in their closet. You could hear every toilet flush all around us. We heard every bit of ice that was dispensed in the ice maker in the hallway. We did call the front desk about the noise in the hallway and they sent security. But it was two nights of no sleep. We actually got accustomed to fire trucks and police sirens outside.;2
Stayed at the New Yorker hotel for the 2nd time. Again We loved it!!! From the moment we checked in, we had a great experience. Had a room with a view which was incredible. We found any staff we dealt with to be so accommodating. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Ice and drinks machine on our floor at lifts. Had dinner in Tick tock diner one of the days but would not repeat as expensive and nicer available but again staff really nice. Macys just mins away. Great location. Would definitely return and would recommend.;5
The hotel prides itself on its history. It could use some updating from that history.   For examples -  the bathroom tub/shower has 4 knobs for water, not convenient. Also a major shortage of electric plugs.;3
"Great Location; Staff that was totally committed to your needs; Restaurant & Bar on Premises; small but Clean Rooms !!!";5
Possible the best hotel Ive stayed at in NYC.  Jose at the front desk was amazing.  The rooms were clean, bright, had fantastic views, and we're large compared to other hotels in the area.  Highly recommended over hotels like The W in the financial district and Room Mate Grace, which offer closet sized rooms and even feature Bunk beds.;5
This hotel is just a few blocks from almost anything and everything you need in Manhattan.  Great location for Madison Square Garden, Times square, The Empire State Building or any shopping you want to do.  Rooms are not large, but the view made up for it in my case.  Hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Definitely worth a look if you are looking to stay in NYC.  I had issues staying connected to their Wi-Fi but that is not really why I stayed there.;5
Room was excellent, very well maintained.  There was more than enough outlets for my family to charge every device they had, which is a lot.  The location was excellent close to all the sights and great places to eat.;5
Stayed here for 4 nights with my wife.6th trip to NYC and would def use this hotel again,rooms were small but really clean,hotel was in a great location with a subway just outside the door 2 food marts a Starbucks a McDonald's and a few others just across the road Really affordable hotel just as good as a 4 star double the price;4
We stayed here in October before a cruise so it was booked as part of a deal by our Travel agent.  It is located between Penn station and the Empire State Building and an easy walk to Times Square.  The lobby was very impressive.  Our room was a big disappointment, it was small and outdated and in need of a refurb.  There was no hospitality tray and not even a bottle of water.  The view from our window was a wall and sky.  Ok for 2 nights;3
I travel for work quite a bit and I belong to the Wyndham Rewards program. I recently rated their diamond status and used some of my loyalty points to secure a room from Dec 5th - 7th. When I arrived I was upgraded to an executive suite on the 40th floor! 2 rooms and an amazing view of Madison Square Garden, The Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, etc. Room was old school Art Deco like the rest of the hotel - spotlessly clean. Elevator situation is the best in Manhattan fast and plenty of them. Lobby is busy and lots of coming and going and people waiting and socializing. Uniformed staff circulate everywhere. Go downstairs and you will see an exhibit of the history of the hotel and you will start to appreciate the refurbished grande style. Onsite dining was good with;5
With the room renovations taking place it makes this hotel the only place I want to stay. It is convenient to so many things to do and see in the city. The staff are helpful and friendly. The two adjoining restaurants serve gods food with excellent service;5
Our room in the New Yorker (A Wyndham hotel) was smaller than hotel rooms I've had in Paris and for less money. The plumbing was old and doused us with alternatively hot and cold water.  It seems Wyndham added a coat of paint and their name only. The lobby was ok, the cafe and restaurant were average too.  The staff however was very good. Location is great.;3
The Lobby in this hotel is amazing, real Art Deco! This hotel has 1,000 rooms. We would never have guessed it as the service is so smooth there never seems to be to many people in one place and one time. The check in service is very good, just watch the daily charge as it does not apply in Winter! Location is spot on 5 minutes from Times Square and Broadway, 10 minutes from the Empire state building and Maceys. The Head Conciege on the Front Door is fantastic and copes with Chaos admirably you should see our movie! This place is that good we want to go back;5
Booked a last minute reservation, which usually costs an arm and a leg in Manhattan, but got a great deal.  The room was conveniently located across the street from MSG and was extremely nice.  The room was small, but had every amenity and came at a great price.;4
Stayed in Wyndham New Yorker from 16th to 24th Nov.16.  Delighted with the location. Just that it was too near to Macys.  My daughter and grandchildren were in and out of it too often.  Room was grand  Had a bit of a view of other tall buildings  nothing great.. Was a bit disappointed that they had no tea or coffee making facilities.  An early morning cuppa would be nice.  Otherwise a great hotel  In a great location.;5
Overall a decent hotel. Great location and average clean rooms. Quite small rooms (normal NYC standards). Very outdated bathrooms (biggest complaint). Great food on sight and convenience to major landmarks nearby! Subway is at hotel!;3
After reading reviews on here I was rather worried that I had made a bad choice and emailed twice to request the price of an upgrade / refurb room before arriving but received a reply. I was dreading arrival.  Arrived around 4pm, there wasn't much of a queue and check in was quick and easy. Room was clean and tidy if a little dated. Room was a fair size, not huge but big enough for 2 adults with 3 suitcases for 5 nights. Room was cleaned daily and no complaints about room but pretty basic. As others say there is no tea / coffee but this doesn't bother me - there is a vending machine by the lift which we used to get water from, but a mini bar might be a nice edition. Hotel itself looks a little dated and worn, a little like it is still trying to me something it isn't.   The;4
Stayed here for an event at the Madison Square Garden.   I would highly suggest it for the location.  As far as the rooms go. . . . I know they are going through an upgrade, but our room had not been upgraded yet.  It's an old hotel,  beautiful architecture,  with much history.  This is not a modern style new hotel.  We stayed in a suite, which I thought would be larger, I think I'll try a different place next time, but we did enjoy the location and a lot about the hotel.;4
Just back from a four day stay. Really liked this hotel. Location is fab five min walk from Macy's. Beside madison sq garden. The rooms are on the small side but we were put on the 36th floor and it was perfect. Fab views. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The tic toc diner is gorgeous to have breakfast in.;4
we have just returned from a 3 night stay at the new yorker and had a fantastic time.The hotel is lovely,staff are amazing and location even better,yes our room was small but for the amount of time we spent there it was more than adequate.Thankyou andrew and staff for my daughters champagne and for your kindness.....and yes we would definatly stay here again!!!;4
The location of this hotel was excellent for us since one of the reasons we were there was to attend a concert at Madison Square Garden which is basically right across the street. We came in by bus to Port Authority and that is only a few blocks away, an easy walk even with a little bit of luggage (we used a roll along which helped).  The room was small, but very clean and comfortable. A large closet was nice as was the old but nice (and very clean) bathroom.  We enjoyed a visit to Macy's which is also very close.;5
Lobby is lovely.....guestrooms not so much. Our room rate $319 a night before taxes and fees bringing you closer to  $400. Tub was peeling, tile in bathroom cracked, chipped and years of gunk in the grout and edges of the floor. Beds were new and comfortable but the overall room was SUPER tired. You can see the potential here but they've got a lonnnnnng way to go.;2
If you haven't been before,i suggest you go for a holiday in a lifetime,it's expensive but fantastic,Times Square was so wonderful,we went to see Billy Joel in Madison Square Gardens,OMG can't believe how wonderful he was. We went on two walking tour's,one to China Town,Little Italy,and Soho it was amazeing the woman who took us really knew her history. The other one was Harlem it was fantastic,we have done so much in nine day's,desperate to go back,need to save the pennies and lot's of them,;5
Some of the decor in our room felt a little old but overall for value for money and customer service and location it is hard to top this place.  We'll be back. It is also super easy to get either the E-Train to Sutphin Blvd or Long Island Railroad to Jamaica (via Penn) and change for the Airtrain.  Cheaper and quicker than a yellow cab.;5
Location of this hotel can't be beaten for getting around Manhattan and further afield. Just across the road from Penn station. 5 mins walk to Macy's, 10 mins to theatre district. Loved the Art Deco feel even if it was a bit jaded in parts. Staff were friendly and rooms spotlessly clean. The adjoining trattoria is also very good for cocktails and continues the 1920's theme. Would definitely stay here again.;4
My family and I stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker this past August. The room was affordable, clean and spacious. The staff was very helpful and professional. The hotel is in a great location being close to Macy's, Penn Station and Times Square. I would highly recommend this hotel. We plan on staying at this hotel the next time we visit New York.;5
Warm and inviting reception. great location and newly renovated room. Mohammad on the Front Desk went out of his way to acknowledge and make our 20th anniversary special...he even sent a card ! I travel 200+ nights a year and really appreciate a fully functional room product...and staff. We were on the 8th floor, perfect for catching the elevator but not a great view. Not an issue, we spent very little time in the hotel (had tickets to HAMILTON on Tuesday! );4
Our room wasn't ready when we asked for an early check in at 1:00. Mohammed assured us he would do his best to get us into a room quickly and he would give us a great room. He did both! About 15 minutes later we had just ordered our meal at the Tick Tock Diner when Mohammed called to tell us our room was ready. We were pleasantly surprised to find a room with two closets and two bathrooms!  Every employee we have seen here so far has been very friendly and helpful. Lots of smiling people! Would definitely stay here again.;5
Arrived at the hotel around 7 pm on the 20th of november, staff very pleasant and check in was quick and hassle free. Room was clean and tidy a little small but we didn't mind as it was only a base for our trip. Of our 4 days staying here we had no complaints.We checked out on thursday which was thanksgiving, as everywhere was so busy that day we were rushing gathering up our things, and i left 3 very sentimental brackets behind of no value to anyone else. A half hour after leaving the hotel i sent an email and phoned the hotel and explained exactly where they were as i knew where i had left them. two days later i received an email saying they were not there. To say i was very disappointed is an understatement and it will definitely put me off or recommending this hotel to;3
It was BIG FUN with our youngest granddaughter Bo in NEW YORK CITY!! It was her turn to join us for a visit to the BIG APPLE where Opa was born and her daddy went to high school! It's a gift we gave to all three grandkids when they finished elementary school. We stayed at Wyndham New Yorker Hotel at 481 Eighth Avenue with friendly personel in a nice area of Manhattan!! I higly recommand it!! We walked miles ans miles everyday and shopped until we dropped. Loved the Broadway mudical Wicked as well as the dinners of chicken fingers, calamari, sushi, Nathan's hot dogs and buffalo wings. Another big hit was Carlo's Bakery on 6th Avenue with great muffins and birthday cakes!!;5
"The New Yorker is an older, wonderful hotel, very centrally located at 34th and 8 Ave. near Chelsea, the HighLine, theaters, some great restaurants, shopping and transportation.  The New Yorker is elegant, friendly-staffed, clean and safe.  We had a small room, but it was totally comfortable from the bed to the lighting and storage.  The bathroom was a little small, but worked fine for us. My wife shared that she felt totally safe and secure in The New Yorker.  We did use the private Business Center for some NYCity map information - the computers and printers worked great. Had no time to use the huge, very well-equipped Health Center.  DID eat in their Tick-Tock, on-site diner for a later evening meal; food was quick and good. We've stayed in a dozen nice NYCity hotels in the";5
We had a top notch, well-appointed room for one night at this hotel.  It was quiet, comfortable and very relaxing.  The hotel is located close to Penn Station and good parking garages.  Access to the Lincoln Tunnel is also excellent.  There is a great diner restaurant and a superb Italian restaurant off the main lobby.  Can't be beat!!;4
The front desk staff is always so helpful in making sure the room is right! They treat you very well.  The house keeping staff do a wonderful job and never forget anything. I've Stayed at the New Yorker, the Marriott Marquee, the Old Helmsly Palace and others and will tell you that you will not find a better hotel- The New Yorker gets top rating from me.;5
Hotel lives up to the name and hospitality. Following specific rules my  husband was able to check in (reservation under my name), relax and await my arrival via NYC traffic. Staff courteous and helpful. Not all rooms have a great view, paying extra can be worth it. Most night activities within walking distance. Day activities also close by...made my trip restful and dramatic. We will return here. Some updates not my taste but I am a Wyndham owner too so I know updates are coming.;4
The hotel is very comfortable with exception staff and the best location you could wish for.  It is right near Penn Station.  Very close to Macy's and Statue of Liberty.  It is also an easy walk to Times Square and right near Madison Square Garden;5
We stayed here for 6 nights over the thanksgiving period. The hotel is in a great location! Round the corner from Macy's and a block away from Madison Square Garden- you can pretty much walk to a lot of places! The hotel has 2 restaurant/diners next door which are convenient. The hotel itself is very popular and busy, but the rooms are slightly outdated. On our first night we were upgraded to a bigger room but unfortunately the bathroom was very outdated with no bathtub/shower instead just a walk in shower. However the hotel staff are very friendly and welcoming, Driss at the front desk was exceptionally nice and changed our room the following day- we stayed on the 31st floor and albeit a smaller room, we had a great view of Empire State Building, the room is more updated and;3
While researching a hotel for NYC, I had a few musts....Location, service and cleanliness.    The Wyndham New Yorker, seemed to fit my criteria, so I booked it and I am glad I did.  When checking in, we opted for a higher level floor, in hopes to get a nice view. We ended up on the 28th floor on a cute corner room, room 2858 which was quite roomy.   Beds were very comfortable, sheets soft, two closets, and a decent view of the hudson river. The room temperature was comfortable and the noise level was never an issue.  We had breakfast at Tick tock a few times and it was good. I indulged in cocktails at their bar and service in both of their locations was very good....They also have a coffee/donut cart set up for coffee on the go, he was there every morning at about 6:00 AM, we;5
I originally booked the metro queen for 2 ppl and used my AAA discount when purchasing on the hotel's website. After reading the reviews, I was most concerned with the size of the room. Luckily, the day before arrival, I received an email offer from the hotel to upgrade to executive queen for $10/night more. To me that was totally worth it. The room was clean and spacious. Though a queen size bed, it seemed small but still do-able. Everything was renovated. Coffee/tea machine in room. Bathroom was nice, shower had super strong pressure. The bathroom itself is not spacious but again, not a big deal to me. It was clean and fresh. Toiletries were provided.  The staff was very friendly at check in. Had a meal at Tick Tock Diner and it was very good. The location was perfect. Overall;4
The New yorker hotel is a wonderful hotel to stay if you're ever needing to stay in the new York area. The staff were all very helpful and kind. ..from GB a manager to the receptionist like Laura and the beautiful telephone operators like Simimi...all so wonderful. From reservation to check out everything was so wonderful, professional and efficient. We had a fantastic time there earlier this month. The suite on the 39th floor was clean and beatifully appointed. The view of most of the landmark skyscrapers of New York, including the Empire state building, the Chrysler Building, Times sq, etc. was phenomenal! It was beautiful by day and by night. I wish I could give these wonderful individuals 10 STARS**********, not just 5. I highly recommend The New Yorker hotel by Wyndham. 418;5
"I travel to NY often for business and struggle to find a hotel worth the price.  This is why I Airbnb majority of the time I travel to NY.  The New Yorker is a decent hotel with a friendly staff.  Hidden ""facility fees"", tiny rooms and paper thin walls.  My first night I had to call security because 2 families nextdoor to me where up until 2am with screaming children running in and out of the hallways.  The hotel couldn't move me into another room, but happily did the next morning when same families were up at 7am making so much noise.    The art deco style is charming, but not worth the stay.";3
"we asked to change rooms because we thought we were given a smaller room than we had booked....they changed us willingly after our first night.  The bathroom was difficult; PT behind the door, with little knee space and inadequate counter space for toiletries.";5
Everyone was so nice and welcoming. Our view was absolutely beautiful, and we look forward to staying here again.;5
We stayed in the hotel for five nights,,,, hotel staff very helpful,,,,, room was spot on had everything we needed,, tv,,,, tea,coffee maker,,, iron and board,,,,hair dryer,,, and the hotel is located in spot,,,,, Madison square gardens , Times square,,,,, would love to go back ,,,,,,,,,;5
Hotel is great, clean tidy and in a fantastic location.  The only thing we would say is that the facility fee is expensive to be charged per night.. but as this a standard charge of the hotel you just have to pay it.  The location is great 0.5 miles from Empire State one block from Macy's. 10 min walk to Times Square would recommend, just bare in mind the city tax, New Jersey tax, facility fee and leisure fees that get added to your final bill.;4
The staff was very efficient, friendly and always willing to assist the guests. The room was small but comfortable and the bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels. The location was very close to the subway and we could get to various places quickly. The hotel had a restaurant that was open 24 hours a day which was perfect for coming and going at all hours.;5
A great hotel with a great location.  Close to Penn Station and very central in Manhattan.  Very clean and good security.  Good value for money.  Close to everything in Central Manhattan.  Service was excellent.  Would definitely recommend.  We had a beautiful view of the Hudson River.;4
The hotel is well  located near Metro Station. Well located near Madison Square Garden , Macy and few blocks from Time Square and Theatres. Affordable and clean hotel.  Very busy hotel with many travellers and tight security, Very pleasant and helpful staff. I would definitely stay there again.;4
What a magnificent hotel. We checked in 19th November after a 8 hour flight we were ready for our room. We were on the 25th floor overlooking the city. The room was for five of us. On entering there was a sofa, tv, table and chairs a fridge and coffee maker. There was bath come shower and in the large bedroom was two double beds, plenty of room and spacious wardrobes and sets of drawers. A great room with history which was mahamod Ali stayed in that room after his fight with Joe Frazier. Photos of him everywhere.;5
"If you enjoy staying in a run down room that looks nothing like the rooms on their website. Ours was 9' x 12."" If you enjoy views of the side of another tall building...if you enjoy sleeping in a small bed (we were told we would have a queen size bed but I think we had a smaller bed). If you don't mind not having a mini fridge, a microwave oven or a coffeemaker in your room...if you don't mind putting up with a toilet that never flushes and having the maintenance guy come to our room every evening. If you don't mind all of these things, then the Wyndham New Yorker is the hotel for you.";1
I love the location but that's all I enjoy from my visits here. You can walk everywhere which is the bonus but the rooms are tired and small and don't always look clean (which I'm sure they are!). It looks as it was a grand hotel back in the 40's but it does need a good make over to compete with all other hotels in the area;3
From check in to check out, the staff was extremely attentive. The hotel is in a great location, a block away from Madison square garden and a 15 minute walk to Times Square. We booked a double bed suite, although not the biggest(it's New York City) double bed suite I've ever stayed in with my wife, 11 year old and 14 year old, it had enough room for us and yes as other reviews have mentioned, the bathroom is small but it serves the purpose that it's meant for. We were on the 39th floor with a terrific view of the Empire State Building.  I would, without hesitation, return to this hotel.;5
Stayed here at the end of October.  We had a fabulous room with brilliant views of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden.  Newly updated and spacious room.  Very well situated near Penn Station.;5
We had a great time! Location could NOT be better.  Very centralized. Subway entrance literally across the street.  Macy's and Empire State a few blocks away. Starbucks across the street, and Familia Italian, which was very tasty, AND delivers for those nights your feet are done walking!! Hotel Customer service was superb.  Made my daughters Birthday very special. We stayed 9 days. Would certainly stay again.  Renovated rooms very clean.  Do not recommend Tick Tock Diner downstairs. Hate to say anything negative since our hotel stay was flawless.  Lots of places to eat nearby, early and late!  Will recommend The New Yorker! Not really 4-5 star, but the location, service, and renovated floors make it feel that way.  Great stay! Can't wait to return!;4
Where do I start?!?! Myself and my wife stayed here recently for a four night stay and we have absolutely no complaints about this hotel. Right from the moment we walked through the doors to the moment we left the hotel to go home, everything was just spot on. We met Mohammed at check in and he kindly gave us a beautiful room on the 35th floor with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building and a complimentary bottle of wine as our trip was to celebrate my wifes 40th birthday. Our room was lovely with such a comfy bed and all the usual extras like hairdryer, bath/shower products and a fine size tv. There is a lovely atmosphere in the hotel and staff are all friendly. There is also such a safe feeling about it too as you have to show your room key to security to get to the;5
Great location near Penn Station. Reception and staff very helpful. There is some remodeling going on and we heard some noise one morning but it was after 9am and we were headed out anyway. Rooms were larger than I expected. Stayed in room with two teens and there was plenty of room.   Bathroom was pretty tiny (shower/toilet) but clean. Walked to Empire State building, Close to shopping and restaurants. Walked to show at St. James theater.   Times Square is walking distance. We walked to Times Square and then Central Park--bit of a hike to both on one haul but it was a lovely fall day.  Close to many theaters.  Very pricey but we went for one night, arrived very early were able to leave luggage and get back at a decent hour that night after the show we saw because it was walking;5
This hotel has got all you need, close to main attractions, rooms are smart and big enough, nice place to eat on sight, plenty of lifts for high floors, and a nice art-deco appearance. Would recommend this hotel.;4
Excellent Hotel.  Wonderful staff.  Safe and secure 3 minutes from everything.  I would recommend this hotel anytime.  We stayed for 3 nights and received excellent service and accommodation.  Tick Tock Diner was great as well.;5
We had a wonderful stay at The New Yorker and were pleasantly upgraded to the tower suite which made our stay much more enjoyable. We were celebrating a special occasion and we're brought up a complimentary bottle of wine...it was a fantastic start to the trip. This hotel is an ideal location when walking around on foot. Would definitely recommend staying here and the views are amazing.;5
I stayed at the New Yorker for 10th time, and the changes are quite noticeable. This time we are assigned to a HC room and it was nice. Certainly, the service staff is #1. FD and Housekeeping staff is quite corteous. Luis, the Door man makes the stay much easier, with his positive attitude and help in getting transportation.  Service in Tic Toc is fast and good food. Reccomendation for customers, call and reserve direct, to get the room you want. When using an OTA, you will receive the least desirable oprtion.;4
I loved this hotel. If you are happy to carry your own luggage and want to have a central base to explore New York this is the best choice. A 24 hour restaurant and an Italian restaurant in the foyer cover off eating for the nights you want to stay in. Clean and comfortable rooms with great beds and linen. Will be back.;5
"During check in, any info was shared about the hotel and its facilities from the frontdesk. And while I was checking out, the hotel charged 70 $ to me for the unused hotel facilities like international phone call and fast internet.I wanted to see the details because I am sure that I have never used phone or internet at the hotel; but there were no details attached because only being a hotel guest is enough for charging this amount for 2 days.It is not fair and the frontdesk is not professional about hosting. Furthermore I forgot my phone charger at the bathroom but they did not give it back or they did not replace it with the New one.They are not guestfriendly people unfortunately.";2
Room was fresh and recently updated and reasonably priced, Front desk was efficient at check in (Thank You Adam), Security staff was pleasant and efficient (Thank You Michael), and the overall atmosphere was Big City New York. I recommend anyone planning to go to Madison Square Garden to book your stay right across the street at The New Yorker Wyndham - a brief and short walk You can't go wrong.- everything was right...;5
Stayed here with 3 friends for 4 nights in one room with 2 double beds. The room was very small as were the beds, the toilet and bathroom were so outdated they may be back in vogue soon- and also not very clean .  I voiced my opinion on Expedia which is the company i booked the trip with whilst we were staying there and reception offered to move us to a larger room which was good until we went to reception to do this. The receptionist said ' I will see what I can do for you as we are very full. After a while she found us another room which to be honest was a little bit larger but not much and certainly was not the upgrade promised. On a positive note the hotel is in fantastic location within a short walk of Empire State , Macy's and Madison Square Garden, the metro/ tube is just;3
Review of New Yorker – Wyndams Hotel New York My daughter and I stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights following a transatlantic cruise on the Queen Mary 2 In November 2016. Having read some reviews about the hotel I was somewhat apprehensive about our stay but all worries were groundless.  We arrived at 10.00 am and naturally our room was not ready so we checked in and left our suitcases in the secure luggage room for free. I utilised the hotel safe, FOC  for my jewellery. Receptionist was very pleasant and helpful, explaining that we had been given an upgrade and had been allocated a large room with two separate bathrooms. (we had paid extra for single beds and I had written to hotel prior to visit) . Our package included Wi Fi  and gym if anyone has energy to use it.  We;5
Worked very well for our family of four adults - stayed in the New Yorker suite which was like having two rooms for the price of one.  All had fabulous hot showers every morning. Amazing views of the Empire State Building especially at night time when lit up with red and blue during the election.  Very close to lots of sight-seeing locations, excellent shopping, subway and Penn station across the road. Convenient to have two dining options on the groundfloor as well as multiple places nearby.  Loved the historic art deco lobby.  Room perfectly clean and tidy on our return each day.;5
Pros - great location, one block from Penn station. Cons - the hotel is very, very tired and in need of a major facelift. The rooms are tiny, even by NYC standards and the noise insulation is non-existent - you can hear conversations in neighbouring rooms and the plumbing is so noisy that if anyone on your floor uses a shower or flushes a toilet, it sounds like they are in your room! Bathrooms are very small and basic with paint peeling off the walls. I couldn't recommend this hotel to friends or family, it is budget in feel but prices aren't reflective of that.;2
Overall, an excellent value and location for NYC. Beautiful lobby, great friendly staff. Minor confusion at check-in but fixed quickly. Internet coverage was just ok. Room was very clean but bathroom sink and shower were significantly clogged. And luggage rack was wedged in closet by iron position. Little annoyances but you can't find much better at this price.;4
Just back from a short break ...amazing location ..very helpful staff . room ,bedding and towels spotlessly clean. Great view of the Empire State building from room 2422. Able to walk to most of New York attractions. Tick Tock diner very reasonable, good service good food.  Plenty of hanging space, iron and ironing board, hairdryer and toiletries provided.;5
This is the second time we have stayed in the New Yorker, I recommend this hotel for its convenient location in midtown and for the old feel, art deco hotel. I will probably not stay anywhere else when I'm visiting Gotham !;5
Was in town for a trade show arrived early the concierge gladly let us check our bags without hesitation.  Upon returning from the trade show, to check we were greeted by the Manager who walked us personally up to our rooms.  Upon returning from leaving for dinner that night, I returned to a bottle of wine.  Couldn't have asked for better service better location and views. Also to the Manager, good luck and congratulations on your baby.;5
Hotel is in a great location. I choose it for that reason. Close to LIRR to get in and it of Manhattan with ease. Not too impressed with the room we had (metro double). Washroom especially was in desperate need of updates. Very worn down and grungy. Awoken all three mornings by the room beside us when they showered. Turning the faucets on and off and having to adjust them non stop while showering emitted a high pitch squeal which I'm sure disturbed them when we showered as ours did the same. The tv in the room was ridiculously small and the daily hotel charge of $29 is outrangeous for what you're getting at this hotel which is nothing at all. I wouldn't go out of my way to suggest this hotel to others but if you're not going to be spending much time in the rooms than I'd;2
Good location - only a block from Penn station and walkable to most of the cities attractions.  Its an older, historic hotel and that shows through in the rooms.  The beds are nice, and the rooms are a good size.  The bathroom was older but had everything you need.  It has a big & nice gym, and the lobby and common areas area great.  For the price and location, it was a great value.;4
We don't always stay in Manhattan, unless we get a great deal - often in the Winter months. But we decided to stay here for our August trip. And we are SO GLAD we did. It was the middle of a really bad heat wave. Heat and humidity were really oppressive. Because were were able to quickly duck back into our hotel room, we were able to cool off and re-energize. This made a big difference for this specific trip.    During both of our stays here, the staff was great. And the room we had this trip was a recently refurbished room. Very nice. Just remember, almost all (affordable) rooms in Manhattan are going to be small. This one was slightly larger than others we had experienced.  Locations is great.  Close to many trains. We always felt safe. Good stay.;5
Starting with the good:   -- Reception staff were friendly and informative. Special mention for Mohammed who was friendly, professional and gave us all the information we required.  -- Staff in general were helpful and friendly.  -- Clean room, with a very comfortable bed.  -- Iron and hairdryer included, together with some complimentary shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc.  -- Nice view.  -- The Tick Tock Diner open 24 hours did some perfectly decent food, which was welcome when we were jet lagged.  -- Good location. Steps from the midtown highlights. 34th St -- Penn Station tube station on the corner made getting to the museums on the Upper East Side and getting downtown a doddle. The High Line just around the corner on W30th and 10th is recommended and an easy way to walk to;3
I'm a Wyndham Hotel Group General Manager and Hospitality Management Company Owner. I stayed at the New Yorker for business in October and in my almost 18 years of hotel experience I've always wanted to stay at the New Yorker. This is a beautiful property still filled with the charms of the hotels beginning. Everything from the check-in process to check-out was incredible and pleasant. Whenever I'm in New York again this is the only place I will stay.;5
"I was booked this through priceline assured that it was a 4 star hotel quality. It was not. The hallways look like they hadn't been updated in 50 years. The room has been updated but some parts were still ""old"". The bathtub would be good example.  When I checked in I was assured that everything has already been paid for so I was surprised to find a bill under my door for a ""facility fee"" 29 + tax each night.  When I went to complain the manager told me he was sorry but the person that checked me in should not have said that. If you want a 2.5 star hotel in a good location then you should consider this hotel as long as you are OK with the ""surprise fees"".";2
Small, not-terribly-exciting or comfortable rooms. Loud as heck, both from outside noise and the hallways. That was the worst part. But ... It's relatively clean. The staff is nice. The gym is decent if you care. The LOCATION is awesome. And I'm still shocked at the affordability, which I'd imagine is why people would come here. Wouldn't rush back but certainly wouldn't avoid it or cringe if I learned I was returning.;3
Thank you to the lovely receptionist that have me a corner room with a awesome view of the Empire State Building because it was my birthday....but that came with a cost.  Careful what you wish for.  Even on the 24th floor each night (2) sounded as if I were on the 3rd floor with the windows open.  Traffic, sirens, and surprisingly at 3:30 a.m.  ,...construction.  2 nights with little sleep.  Bathroom: awful.  Tub..clogged...bed...meh.  Sorry New Yorker but it's time for a serious makeover.;2
We stayed for 4 nights and was disappointed with the state of our bathroom. There was rusty bits on our tiles and the floor tiles were scuffed and chipped. The taps were covered in limescale and the room was very dated.  The staff at the lift area were extremely rude. When asking for our room cards to gain access they shouted YES and made me feel like a criminal.;2
We had a fantastic stay 40th floor with Empire State Building AND World Trade One view! Overwhelming!  Staff was very friendly and competent. Rooms were clean and well tended.;5
the lobby was nice and large and the price for the size of the room was great.  Also it is very close to Penn station so you can take the Amtrak here and stay at the hotel without driving into NY.  It has a restaurant that serves food 24/7 and the food service was good and fast.  We would definitely stay here again.  Custom service was great.;5
I had a room that was combined from two smaller room into one. By NYC standards it was large, prior to the merger they must have been two phone booths. It was an older room but still in the Art Deco style that dominates the lobby of the hotel.   Overall it was clean, slightly run down but an enjoyable change from the normal corporate hotels I normally stay in. I'd go back when the price was right.;3
"The location is fantastic and the building is historic, but I'd prefer a little less ""history"" in the plumbing. I suffered through a cold shower and brown water in my sink on one of the two days I stayed. The room is small, which I expect in midtown, so I wasn't too grumpy about that. The room could've used a few more power outlets though. This building certainly shows its age in every manner of speaking.";2
So pleased that Wyndham has taken over this historic Art Deco gem of a property. The hotel is in excellent condition and the location can't be beat for its proximity to Penn Station, the subway, the High Line. A terrific diner and an upscale restaurant are welcome amenities -- and if your package includes Continental Breakfast, the views from the 39th floor breakfast room are spectacular!;4
We were going to the city to celebrate a family members birthday. I decided to booked a room via Trip Advisor at the New Yorker for one night rather than travel back home that evening. Although I go to the city frequently, this was my very first stay at a NYC hotel. The New Yorker is in a great location, walking distance to Madison Square Garden, Macy's Herald Square and other shopping, Empire State Building, etc. There is also a 24 hour diner attached to the hotel as well as a Starbucks, Duane Reade, pizza place and CVS very close by.  On arrival, the hotel lobby was bustling with people. Front desk personnel were friendly and welcoming. Check-in took a while, their systems were running slow. The hallways are narrow and frankly a little dreary. My initial room was horribly;4
In terms of location, the hotel is found at the corner of 35th st and 8th.  There's Duane Reede right in front of you and 7-11 2 blocks down.  You are about 10 blocks away from Time Square and 2 crosses away from Penn Station that gets you everywhere including trains to Newark, JFK, Philadelphia, New Jersey etc. .  Security to go up is strict, they have a doorman that checks people if they have keys.  The Hotel gets filled a lot! Lobby is quite tight although it has a huge space.  The rooms are big and have microwave ovens.  Ours had 2 bathrooms (only one with shower).  What I love about the hotel is how they mixed old to modern comfort.  They preserved the vintage look of the hotel.  Right now they are undergoing renovation, they have all these scaffolds outside but it's still;5
Very beautiful and always full of people coming and going, wich makes it very pleasent to be in the huge lobby! Bellisimo y siempre con un alto transito de personas, y muy comodo lobby para sentarse y admirar!;5
Some friends and I came over Halloween weekend to celebrate their Birthdays. We flew into Newark and took the train to Penn Station, leaving us just 2 blocks from the hotel. The property itself is just steps from time square and Madison square garden.   We were checked in by Miguel and he was phenomenal. He immediately acknowledged the Birthday's in the group, mentioned he upgraded us, and sent up a bottle of champagne. If we needed anything throughout our stay, Miguel made sure it was executed immediately.   In order to access guest floors you must flash security your room key, this made us feel safe. The room was quite spacious which is not what you expect for a NYC hotel. The bathroom was tiny but manageable...shower was excellent. A friend used the fitness center and;5
This hotel is steps from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden. ALL employees were friendly and helpful!!! I requested a high floor and away from the elevator - both accommodations were made with a smile. The room was not available when were arrived (we were a bit early), but front desk called when it became available which was only about a half hour later.  The room was fairly small but very nice and very clean.  We had a beautiful view of the Hudson. The 24 hour diner was a great convenience when leaving MSG late after an event - prices were very reasonable. I also liked that security checked everyone's room keycard before permitting access to the elevators. The only complaint would be the facility charge that was added to the bill which was not expected.  I booked directly thru;5
"Very disappointed.  4 Adults - we opted for an extra bathroom so help with getting ready - what a joke.  The one bathroom shower was horrible.  The pressure out of the shower head was so bad that I had to get on my hands and knees and rinse the conditioner out of my hair under the tub faucet.  Why the tub faucet had great pressure and the shower faucet did not, is unknown.  Also, room 2001 with the extra bathroom sits behind 2 elevators.   Needless to say - none of us got a very good nites sleep.I expected a hotel tax from NYC and NYS ($36.23) but did not expect a $29 facility Fee and then get taxed on that too. AND - $2.00 Occupancy Tax; NYS Hotel unit Fee -$1.50. Then you get the regular hotel and sales tax AND a Non-room tax by both NYC and NYS - really????? I thought I was";2
The hotel has very interesting history. But these days the hotel is quite shabby , our room was tiny.  I would not chose this hotel again. The hotel was not cheap at all. The location is good, but better to live not further then 7th avenue.;3
Visited the Wyndham New Yorker April 2016 Lovely hotel and friendly staff. Very old hotel so it is a bit tired but we had no problems at all, was clean and quiet!! It's just a place to get your head down at the end of the day!! It's in a great location with easy access to anywhere in NYC!! Free wifi in the hotel lobby, Alton it can get very busy therefore the wifi becomes slow!! Would definitely stay here again on my next visit to New York, and highly recommend it to other people considering a trip here!!;5
Everything was great.  I chose The New Yorker again because of the wonderful staff, the location and the cost.  Very clean and the room was great. I was able to take advantage of the great specials and got a great room for a great price. Had a wonder view!;5
The hotel is OK.  The rooms are clean and fine.  I was disappointed that there was no coffee making facilities that there is in every other NY hotel.  Its perfectly located for Macys, Madison Square garden etc.    Unfortunately the area has lots and lots of homeless people as the area has a high foot fall.  It can be a little intimidating as a girl on your own.  Staff were friendly and lots of places to eat near by  7 min walk from Macys so its perfect for shopping;3
This was my first time in New York and I would definitely choose this facility again for my stay. The hotel was centrally located. The subway station was literally a minute away, Madison Square Gardens was like a 5 minute walk and Times Square was maybe like a 10 minute walk. I had the executive double w/ view which my view was Madison Square Gardens. The the room was very nice and clean. But like most of the reviews you have read, the bathroom wasn't as big as a closet. The staff had great customer service skills especially the lady I checked in with & the housekeeper. We arrived at about 10 that morning and was able to check our bags in for free until check in time. I would definitely recommend this hotel.;5
Spent two nights at the New Yorker Hotel in October, 2016. Near (walking distance) to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Well staffed, courteous and clean environment. Enjoyed the diner styled restaurant located just off the lobby.;5
My wife and I normally stay up town but were booked into the New Yorker for the New York marathon. The room was small but clean and well appointed and cleaning staff did little extras. The art Deco lobby and building history were of note as were the Tick Tock Dinner (open 24hrs and) and Italian resturant (closes too early). Location between 34th and 35th is across from MSG and close to Macey's. Subway stop right at hotel. The hotel was wonderful during marathon and it was much appreciated. Good value for the price. 2 improvements that should be made: Hotel needs loaner umbrellas and shouldn't charge to store bags while waiting to head to the airport.;4
You know how one interaction can make a stay great? My checkin here set the tone for my stay. Omelia Green (I asked for her name) was very kind and efficient in getting me into my room a bit early and helping me find a spot to work while waiting. She took a ton of stress out of my day.   It's NYC, so the room was smaller than normal, but still well appointed. The view was great and it was relatively quiet for staying in the city. I would absolutely stay here again, especially for the reasonable price I paid for a weekday stay.;4
I live in California, so I really wanted to explore the East Coast of the United States as everyone was talking to me.  So I was in this hotel and I am far from disappointed. This is typically American, the setting is great, the location is beautiful (in Times Square). When I go back to New York, I would go here again for sure!;5
Whenever I have tickets for something at Madison Square Garden, and will be taking the train to NYC, I stay here.  It is in very close walking distance to both MSG and Penn Station.  The staff are professional and accommodating.  The hotel is beautiful, decorated in an Art Deco style.  It has an adjoining restaurant (The Tick Tock Diner) with good food that is also reasonable.  The hotel's price is pretty fair for this location and a good value.;5
We used Wyndham rewards points to reserve a standard room 2 double beds.  We received an offer to upgrade to a suite for $50.  Well I was amazed that we had the upgrade and how huge the upgrade was.  The suite had 2 bathrooms, 3 closets, 7 windows, a fireplace (not usable), couch, 2 chairs, and a large dining table with 6 chairs.  Our space was enormous.  The doormen were so helpful, all staff were very friendly.  My kids loved the Tick Tock Diner next door.  We were able to leave our luggage before checking in (free) and after checking out($2 bag).  I would definitely stay here again.;4
This is my second time at this hotel. Must remark the change for good!! I received an executive room completely renovated. Beds comfortable and clean. The lobby is stunning The staff is very friendly, and the location is near to everything  Totally recommend!;5
A few years ago I gave this place a very good review after staying in one of the large Suites on a high floor.  Planning a trip back to New York to see Hamilton with a friend, I called the reservation office and talked to somebody personally about booking a suite like I had before.   She looked at my history and saw where I had stayed.  I felt very confident that it would be fine to share with my friend giving her the bedroom and I would gladly take the sofa bed because the view was so great and there was a bath off the living area as I had recalled.   What a surprise when I checked in and got to the room on the 22nd floor.   They called it a suite but it was really not suitable for two people to share equally.   It looked like it had been two separate rooms with one door;3
Worked out well for our planned trip to Madison Square Garden and to the sights of lower Manhattan.  Very close to the subway station.  There is a check in the lobby to show your room key (generically) which is a good thing to keep just anyone from wandering up the elevators. My only complaints were that due to the ledge above the toilet, you could not get the toilet seat to stay up and it's hard to turn the shower on without getting soaked because of the glass door configuration. Yes, as expected the rooms are very small and the bathroom is even smaller so it's just a bit hard to move around in there to get ready. Also, when my bill arrived it had another $30 facility fee or something like that they claim is added to all rooms in all hotels. I don't dispute that notion as I saw;4
Does anybody have an email address for the Wyndham New Yorker hotel in New York, my wife and I stayed there 4 years ago and I would like to contact them. Our stay then was very enjoyable, the staff friendly and the Tick tick restaraunt for breakfast good.;5
The whole experience was totally underwhelming. My husband had convinced me that moving to the 'iconic' New Yorker for our last few nights would be a great move. Turns out that at least half the hotel is accommodating students and our floor was just above. We had noise of students banging on our floor (their ceiling), student mess clearly visible from the window in the floors underneath and students using the hotel facilities. The decor was outdated and the room was small. The management were polite but didn't go out of their way to do anything special. It was a far cry from the Empire Hotel which we had stayed at just before the New Yorker. The Empire Hotel in contrast was stylish with wonderful staff and an excellent location. The reasonable location of the New Yorker did not;2
Like many others, I agree that the location is the best things about this hotel. And you do get what you are paying for. Basic, however quite dated rooms, accommodation in great location. Everything within walking distance. Room itself is as big as showbox, sheets were new and clean, service friendly.;3
Have now completed two conferences at this location, and have loved it both times! Hotel staff is friendly and accommodating, and the facilities available are clean and stylish, which is more than most spaces in NYC.;4
A nice hotel on a great location, we have been here before. Close to Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, Macy's etc.  Very friendly staff.  They have a diner (Tic-Toc) next to the hotel with great brakfast.;5
We booked into The New Yorker during November 2016 for 6 days. The hotel is excellently located, literally 9 min walk to Time Square and Empire State Building as well as less than 1 min from the main subway and Madison Square Garden.   In terms of the rooms, the rooms were clean and pretty basic (TV, Coffee, shower etc), just note that the rooms are small (remember you in NYC property prices are insane).    I would definitely stay here on my next trip.;5
I recently spent 9 nights at the New Yorker, while I was holidaying in New York.  It's just far enough away from Times Square and Broadway that the pricing is cheaper, however close enough that it is all in walking distance.  We were kindly upgraded to a larger room as  they saw we would be staying for 9 nights.   The strip it's on is beyond busy, so give a good half hour to walk to Times Square/Broadway shows. We stayed here specifically because we had planned to see a show a night. Subway is just around the corner, so very close.  Rooms were relatively clean and the hotel well secured. Heaps of people staying there, but you never had to wait long for the lift (that sounds like such a nitpick, but it can be a major nuisance).   It was appealing too because it had two;4
"39th floor, nice view... but, the room's so small you can't swing a cat, and everything smells old and nasty. No refurbished rooms here.  Great location, though - very near to Penn Station - and Times Square. We only stayed one night, so I didn't get much ""service"" from the staff, but what interaction we had was very good.";3
We took the train to New York City for a quick overnight trip.  I was surprised how close to Penn Station the hotel is.  (No Uber thank you!)  We were checked in very quickly by Mohammad (Sp?) and enjoyed chatting with him during the process.  The room was lovely, with a view of the river.  The two queen beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom was cool in it's deco way.  (Although Door #1 (Exit), Door #2 (Bathroom) and Door #3 (closet) threw me off a little when finding the bathroom in the middle of the night)  We'd stay here again, based on how well we were treated when we arrived.  We really enjoyed our short stay.;5
We stayed overnight while in town for a concert at Madison Square Garden.  The locations were just half a block from each other and it was so easy to walk around the neighborhood to get dinner and pop right back across the street to our room after a long night.    We took the train into Grand Central and walked to the hotel because it was such a nice day.  It only took 20 minutes or so.;5
Located in an ideal location, subway entrance close to hotel, close to a lot of  tourist attractions, felt safe & secure w/security in lobby. Concierge desk came in very handy to guide us w/directions to where we wanted to go. Would stay here again.;5
Recent stay in NYC for business and was put up at this property. Location, lobby, restaurants are fantastic. Rooms are sub-sub-optimal. First, extremely small and hard to navigate. Literally could not open my bathroom door more than 1/2 way due to towel rack behind it (who does that?) and hallways/room were in desperate need of refreshing. Sink did not drain properly and had to watch to avoid overflow (did alert staff). BUT...view of Times Square was awesome and the bed was very comfy allowing a few good hours of sleep following a very delayed flight/arrival. Staff are usual perfectionists expected for this area and quite helpful. If you just need a well located flop space, this will serve well. Could not imagine staying more than 1 day in the room.;3
"We had a great stay at The New Yorker. The staff was friendly, helpful and my requests for a rollaway bed, extra bathrobe and towels were taken care of immediately. The room was spacious (for NYC) and quiet (again for NYC, no hotel can stop the sound of blaring sirens from the street below) clean and tastefully decorated. Our double beds were very comfortable as was the rollaway my daughter slept on. Two closets provided plenty of space for clothing and luggage and separate desk area provided a great spot to drop our purses and bags from the day's shopping without ""cluttering up"" the room. Because there was a large mirror next to the desk, we were also able to use the area as a place for getting ready in the morning while the bathroom was occupied. Bathroom, though small, was";5
A very lovely hotel. It's a block away from MSG for which we went for a concert. I loved the 12pm check out time. It gave us time to sleep in, and have breakfast before checking out. I also like the security when entering the hotel.;5
Really nice rooms - I was only floor 30 which have recently been renovated and although not huge, it was perfect. The location is excellent for so many great tourist attractions - Empire State, Times Sq, shopping etc Really great staff - so friendly and helpful Highly recommended;4
Stayed 5 nights, we were upgraded on arrival to a much bigger room with two bathrooms. Reception desk fast and efficient. Suzie on the concierge desk was very knowledgeable. Great location for getting about to see all the sights.;5
This was our second time staying in the New Yorker, we stayed there eight years ago, this time we went with our two kids (8 and 10).   From the very start we were treated fantastic.. The staff are all very friendly and helpful, on arrival we received an upgrade to great room on the 37th floor overlooking the river.. the room was a great size and spotless, thanks to Emily we got a lovely surprise and a great memento  for our stay in New York .. something our kids will treasure!   I asked reception for a coffee machine and it was delivered the next day .. I cannot fault this hotel one bit.    We had breakfast in the Tick Tock diner one day and dinner there one evening, most of the time we brought in Bagels for breakfast and had pizza one evening for dinner.  Location is great with;5
We throughly enjoyed our trip to New York. Though the room was very small it was clean and comfortable. We were so busy seeing the sights we didn't spend much time in the room. We would stay here again.;3
We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Javits Convention Center. It turns out it was also within blocks of 2 other venues - Hammerstein Ballroom and Madison Square Garden. It meant popping back to the room for snacks and to drop off swag really easy. In addition, it was really well situated for walking to Times Square theatres, Macys, Empire State building so the location was perfect.  In addition, the staff (from front desk to house keeping) were extraordinarily friendly and helpful. Finally, our room was huge for NYC with great beds, huge banks of windows, 2 closets, etc. The only downside was no fridge (but you can rent a small one) or microwave for leftovers. Otherwise it was a great.;5
Great room - two bathrooms was a bonus Great service at the check in desk and by the security team at the elevators. Felt secure in hotel, location was superb right outside Penn St and subway was very easy to navigate.;5
Hotel is in excellent location close to Madison square gardens and Penn station hotel has great breakfast cafe Tick Tock  Empire State and Macys short walk overall great hotel with history aswell;5
We were able to obtain a refurbished room on the seventh floor and the decor was very nice but so small we could only get one suitcase on a stand with the other on the floor completely blocking the access to the desk and coffee machine. No instructions to operate the coffee machine so I filled it up, pressed the start button and water started seeping over the desk, so gave it a miss, just a card with simple instructions would suffice, the hotel needs to address this. All the reception desk staff were very helpful whenever there was a query (they did offer to send someone up to sort out our coffee machine but we were tired after a long journey and we declined)   The concierge was also helpful with any question I had, as was the transport guy at the desk who looked remarkably like;4
"Surprise ! Everything was fine; location (proximity to train and bus terminal), close to Times Square, but the check out moment was a blow with 'Facility Fees'.  Obviously, there was no mention of such fees upon reservation and full payment with Amtrak bookings; in fact, we thought we had a fairly good deal. I call that '' Hidden Fees ''.  The clerk mentioned our Free Wi-Fi, gym access, etc., but it's not free if there is an invoice charged to your credit card upon checkout !";4
After booking our holiday we looked forward too after all we were going to New York,on arrival we were greeted by the reception who informed us that we had to give them our card details for them to hold $180 of our hard earned money.after we were booked in we were told about wifi in our rooms and a password was giving to us for the wifi in the lobby,not once were we told this was chargeable until the morning of our check out we got a nice surprise under our room door a bill of $98.50 for wifi.i think it's a disgrace that the hotel your staying in as a guest charges you for wifi,this was taking off the money that they were holding but that's another story.the money they take from you if you have anything else left that is after there facility fees and taxes we get the rest of our;1
Location was good as next to Subway. I booked and paid thru Priceline and was surprised by the facility fee I was asked to pay at checkout.  Price paid was thru bidding so it didn't give me a choice to reject the purchase if I had noticed the details did mention there may be additional charges from the hotel. When checking in, the front desk said that it was a big room but it was one of the smallest hotel rooms I've ever been in.;3
We were there for a single night. The room was clean and basic and Manhattan small as expected. Our room had zero view the window looked out to a flat roof and brick parapit..  Bathroom was small but clean.  Again nice clean and completely average.  Would stay again.;3
We will be staying at The New Yorker next week.  I just had to call because of an issue that arose and I am super impressed with how awesome the customer service was.  Somesh was patient, professional and extremely helpful.   Went above an beyond and this is making me even more excited to stay here for my trip! Thank you Somesh!!!;5
The secretary is so rude that you can't even try to understand what's going on! When I stayed there, my credit card was blocked, but I didn't know that... when I asked her why, she answered rudely!  She would be more patiently and threat the clients better!;3
"While updated, this still bears the signs of being an older hotel. The rooms are small, with some awkward layouts. Halls twist with right turns at strange places. No options to do your own laundry. Lobby gets crowded when groups arrive or depart, with no good overflow space. Information desk was very helpful and friendly. Bed was comfortable; bathroom was small with black gunk in some corners and the ceilings were cracked. TP in an awkward location.  Housekeeping couldn't follow the ""green"" option and replaced towels and linen daily.";3
We stayed here for 5 days in September, we had 2 double rooms which were well decorated, spacious and great views of the New York skyline. The bathrooms were a bit dated but they were clean and the shower was pretty powerful.  The hotel has a diner downstairs which is great for breakfasts with plenty of dishes to choose from. There is also an Italian restaurant and bar and the food there is great too.  The hotel is located close to Times square, Penn station, Madison square gardens and Macys. I would definitely stay here again.;5
I understand the hotel is in the process of refurb'ing rooms, but we were unlucky enough to be allocated to an old style room. View from the 32nd floor was overlooking the Hudson river, and not spectacular (would have preferred to see more of the city), but acceptably nice.    The room itself is quite large in comparison to other NYC hotels, but disappointingly lacking in facilities. There is plenty of room for a fridge or coffee machine, or even a kettle, but none are present. This means the only options for hot drinks are the Starbucks across the road, or the TickTock restaurant in the lobby. On our first morning we visited the TickTock, but after being charged $5 per bowl of cereal we didn't come back.  Room was acceptably clean, though noticeably dusty around the edges of;3
Good: The front desk is much nicer than other Wyndham hotels. It's also pretty interesting to see The Tesla Room if you are a science fan.  Bad: The hotel is a bit crowded but I guess that's the price you have to pay if you're right next to Penn Station. The room is small even in New York's standard.;4
The staff was great: The room service, the bell hops, the doormen, the registration desk. First i was in room 2201. 3 closets, 2 bathrooms....very luxurious. But next to the elevator. By the 4th night (Friday) i felt i was in the middle of a train station all night with trains going on the tracks and reversing and once in a while just as I drifted off to sleep a big ground-shaking thump. So I called down and was told I'd be moved the next day, and I was relieved since my wife was coming in from out-of-state. Well, we ended up in Room 2238. Small, but that's okay. But the shower was four sprinkles with very little control over water temperature and the sink filled up with water the minute you ran the water (it was stopped up.) Two sub-standard rooms for a convention deal at $300;1
I spent five nights at the New Yorker.  Because I had fallen on my way to the hotel, I was very concerned about my room.  However, when I arrived, it seems that every wish had been fulfilled.  My room could not have been better for me and my needs!;4
We stayed for 13 nights at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel in October 2016. This is an excellent hotel on 8th Avenue very close to all midtown attractions, Broadway shows, with subway connections just outside the hotel. Staff were excellent, security was first class and the room we had was great.;5
We were recently in NYC to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and Halloween. From the moment we walked into the hotel we were greeted by many smiles and friendly faces. Miguel at the front desk was amazing. Upon hearing we were here celebrating a birthday he had a bottle of champagne sent up to our room to help celebrate. Throughout our stay he was very helpful and always there for us. Even though there are many other options in NYC it is employees like Miguel that will definitely bring us back to the New Yorker on our next visit to NYC.;5
The hotel looked good on line but is definitely not a 4star. This hotel needs some upgrading!. On entering the hotel the lobby was beautiful but as we entered the elevator I realized how tired the building was. The room was very small with no coffee maker, no fridge and the bathroom!!!!! The bathroom!!! The smallest toilet I have ever seen and the flooring was dark green and definitely needed replacing with dirt stuck in the corners and a broken towel rack. Because there was no fan in the bathroom the paint was peeling from the ceiling. To make matters worse I was handed a bill at the end of my three night stay for 38$ per night for taxes and amenities. What AMENITIES???? This is the last time I will be visiting any Wyndham.;2
Make sure you stop into the basement level of this hotel, there's a lot to see!  Tesla lived in rooms 3327-3328, there's a plaque outside of his rooms.  The rooms are decent size for a NYC hotel room.  There's a 24/7 diner connected to the hotel called Tick Tok.;4
Had a fab time here. Great staff and location was perfect for us. Thanks for your hospitality! This is our 3rd time visiting the big apple as we love it so much. This will definitely be our hotel of choice.;5
We stayed for 7 nights as a party of six and found it to be a comfortable hotel which was a great location. It has a lot of history and has a small museum in the lobby. Muhammed Ali stayed there along with many others including Nikola Tesla. The hotel has two restaurants - one is a 24 hour diner Tick Tock and this is very good. We used it a lot for big breakfasts and other meals. We did not use the Trattoria so cannot comment on that. There is evidence of some renovations underway which is needed in places as corridors and rooms are a bit dated. That said they were clean and comfortable. Good security and staff very helpful. A great holiday - we were two blocks from Times Square - opposite Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens. Recommend hotel.;4
"Stayed here for a week on business, stayed in the New Yorker View Suite Queen on the 26th Floor.  Room was a decent size for NYC. The ""living room"" area was pretty spacious with a fold-out couch for additional sleeping space and the layout was open enough you could probably get an extra roll-away or queen size air mattress on the floor for even more sleeping space if staying with a whole family.  Pics on their website for this suite are accurate and look exactly like the room I stayed in so bonus points for accuracy there.  Hotel has a diner co-located on the ground floor that was honestly probably one of my favorite places to eat during the entire trip. The chicken tenders & waffles with a side of bacon hit the spot multiple times. Nothing blow your mind amazing about the";3
We booked this for the last leg of our honeymoon and I wish we'd now looked around for somewhere a bit more modern. The room was basically just a double bed with limited space to put your stuff. Bathroom was clean but again quite small and the toilet was very loud when flushing!  The staff were friendly and helpful on arrival and checking out helping us with luggage and getting a taxi to the airport. Location was very good but I'm not sure I'd book here again as we weren't blown away by it. It was just a place to sleep at the end of the day which is why I'm giving it the rating I have.;3
Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights, everything went wrong from the moment we walked through the door. We ordered a twin room, only to find out that we had one double bed. We complained and so the manager found us a twin room even though the receptionist said there wasn't any. We moved rooms at just after midnight, only to enter an icy cold room and damp bed linen. We just got in bed as we were exhausted from a 12 hour train journey. We woke up the next morning still freezing and the curtains were blowing as the windows were not properly sealed. We tried turning the heater up but nothing happened. We phone down and asked someone to come up and fix it but no one ever came. Would not recommend it to anyone.;2
I stay often at the Wyndham New Yorker and it is fabulous. The staff are so friendly and helpful and its a very inviting hotel from the moment you step into the lobby. It has an art deco era vibe and the rooms are furnished to a high standard and some offer incredible views of Manhattan. It has a great diner open 24hours in the hotel for all your dietary needs and there is a plush Italian restaurant inside the hotel aswell. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Big Apple. Tea and Coffee facilities are available upon request and there is a lovely fresh coffee stand in the lobby also. Security is high as they check everyones room key before they can gain access to the elevators which offers guests peace of mind. All in all a fantastic hotel, cannot fault a stay I;5
Great staff, prime location . Everyone at the hotel was super friendly and helpful. The property is located in an area that makes getting around fast and simple. It is five minutes walking distance to Times Sqaure, ten minutes to Chinatown (on the Subway) and actually has a Subway entrance on the corner (34St and 8th Ave).;5
Overall, the Wyndam New Yorker was OK.  The staff couldn't be nicer or more accommodating and the location was great for us on this particular trip.  Our room was clean, but I have to say that I travel a lot for work and family and, suffice it to say that, I have never, ever, stayed in a smaller room in any hotel. The room was small, but clean and the bathroom was old and small.  The shower on all 3 days for both of us ran in a continuous flow from scalding to comfortable to ice. We had no view.  It was fine for a quick 2-night stay.;3
Lovely friendly and welcoming staff. Rooms quite dated but I think that's in keeping with the theme of the hotel. Very clean and fresh sheets and towels everyday. Cleaning staff very friendly. Would definitely stay here again.;5
Well maintained Art Deco hotel. Queen room on 27th floor was larger and better laid out than many higher price red venues. Booked a week in advance for $285. Taxes pushed daily rate to $360/d.  Tick tick dinner off the lobby was pedestrian, would opt for Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks for next breakfast.;1
Beautiful Art Deco hotel in a very central area of Manhattan, we were upgraded due to it being our daughters birthday to a room on the 33rd floor with views of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens from the other.  We had a perfect stay here.  Yes the bathroom is a bit smaller than most and there are extra charges but we were aware of this from the start and to be honest, who stays in their room any longer than needed in NYC?  The staff we encountered were very helpful, from checking us in to arranging a car to take us to the airport.  We ate in the Tick Tock diner a couple of times with no major problems. It was clean and the food was edible so all was good. We would come back here again for sure;4
Having read some previous reviews, I was slightly concerned. However from the moment we arrived I worried no more. At check in a chap called Carlo acknowledged our 5 night stay and upgraded us to a room which had 2 bathrooms ( a fabulous thought given 2 teenage girls) Our room was in my view spacious and very clean. No view but we were not in New York to stay in the Hotel! Beds super comfy and room serviced daily. The staff are so so helpful, always happy to direct you and even suggest other places to see near your chosen attraction. I loved fact you had to show room key to access lifts. We would absolutely stay here again.;4
Stayed here for four nights, room was nice but bit on small size. Hotel staff are very helpful and friendly. They own a diner which has the most yummmy food in New York. Situated within walking distance from Macy's and attractions. Old vintage deco but lovely.;5
Seriously, the rooms were great. Not sure what it is but the hallways creeped me out a bit. Otherwise OK, no frills, typical mid-town hotel. The room had a bit of an old style Victorian almost leaning Gothic feel. Although it was OK, it was not good enough for me to stay at again. Just too many options for a blah place... Great if you need a place near Penn Station...;3
visiting for the fourth time. fine hotel, nice staff en good rooms.  location is ecellent for sightseeing next to the metro / Penn trainsstation lot's of restaurant in de area, walking distance tot Time Square;4
We have a great experience and the hotel was perfect for being centrally located for all of Manhattan. However the room was small with 2 double beds. The staff was extremely nice.;4
"Very nice and good placed. We had a wonderful room with splendid view on the Empire State Building  Personal was kind, helpful and friendly.  Hall, room everything in very good standing and "" old-fashioned "" in good sense.";5
Loved this hotel and had a very comfortable stay here. I had to change our room which was my fault as i had booked a room for 4 and then last minute thought that 2 double beds were not great as meant my teens had to share. The hotel does not do a room with a double bed and twin beds apart from a suite. The reception were great and upgraded our room to a bigger one and then i just paid extra for an additional fold down bed.  We were on 36th floor and our room was great with a fab view. This hotel is not modern and a little quirky but that is its charm.  What made this hotel is the staff even the security were fab. Nothing was ever any trouble. Alway's had a good morning from even the cleaning staff. I also want to say how great the doorman were very funny to watch when they have;5
I have been a Guest at the New Yorker since 1958, ( H.S. Senior Class Trip ) .  I have stayed at this Hotel many times since, all under different Companies.  The Wyndham is by far the BEST!  I could find nothing to fault them with, well, perhaps a larger shelf for the toiletries.  Front Desk staff has always been very friendly and courteous.  An iconic Hotel that deserves your stay.  You won't be disappointed!;4
Nice hotel and our room was clean and comfortable.  Within walking distance to many NYC sites....quick subway ride to others. Penn station/Madison Square Garden is only one block away.  We will stay here again next time we come to NYC.;5
Starting off with our arrival: 1- Counter staff friendly and polite. 2- The concierge suggested a really terrific restaurant for lunch. 3- The doorman got us a cab and gave great NYC information. 4- Our room on the 39th floor had a wonderful view of the Empire State Bldg. We'll be back for the holidays!!;5
A beautiful Art Deco hotel in a perfect position. All staff were helpful and the facilities immaculate. The room was large and had 2 bathrooms which was great as there were 4 of us sharing. Some Original features remained which we loved. The food in the Tick Tock diner was fantastic and the service excellent. Highly recommended. Would definitely visit again.;5
"The Wyndham New Yorker is a great hotel to stay at if you haven't got a lot of time in New York. It is well located, close to the Subway and within walking distance of a lot of New York attractions. The accommodation is relatively basic, though tidy and clean. The ""resort fee"" charged by the hotel is excessive, given there are almost no resort features in the hotel.";3
My husband and I stayed at this hotel during a fall weekend.  We live in Philadelphia and we were able to take the commuter train and then catch Amtrak.  Penn Station was just across the street.  We lucked out!  Our room was one that was handicapped accessible, not only was it spacious but we had a view of the Empire State Building!  We were in walking distance of many of the sights.Although some people stated in their reviews that the lobby needed to be updated I thought that the lobby was part of the Hotel's Art Deco charm.;5
What an amazing Art Deco building! The interior of the rooms and the hallways felt a little outdated, but the lobby was pure nostalgia! Nice personnel and very convenient that there's a diner next door that's open 24/7. The location is probably the biggest asset. 2 blocks away from Herald Square, 1 block from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Would definitely stay there again.;4
We stayed here before going on a cruise, we used our Wyndham points to book a metro room. Room has 2 double beds and we normally see queen size anymore. Room an ok size but we did add a rollaway. Bathroom showed it's age, quite small. Staff friendly and two restaurants on site.;3
Not a bad stay, room was clean but they are definitely in need of a refurbishment which I believe they are starting! It is in a good location - this was our first time in New York and we felt like it was a really good location to see things and get to know the City. We really did enjoy our stay. Service was not that brilliant - but was ok. Is a good hotel for a stay in New York I would recommend mainly based on a good location.;4
Staff superb. Location is excellent across road from Madison Sq. Garden. Rooms small but to be expected in New York. Reception area immaculate but hallways could do with updating. Clean tidy and maid service every day. Wifi is excellent very fast but you need to sign in everyday. Overall no complaints.;4
Lovely central  hotel really close to penn station. Clean rooms and lovely staff. Had dinner at tick tock diner below which was ok but portions enormous  as don't do smaller portions for kids which is disappointing.;5
Just left the hotel this morning after a 5 night break.  The rooms are out dated however the Art Deco feel about the building and its heritage makes you except the fixtures fittings!  It's extremely clean and the bright white bed sheets makes it all worth while! The views are stunning and the situation is perfect for site seeing!  Staff are polite and the bar at street level show a whole new reflection on capitalism! Watch the suited guys scurrying back from their offices and the next to come...a black chap on crack cocaine wobbling across the side walk... If you like people watching do it!!  Macy's just around the corner with some great places to eat near by!  Only grip no tea making facilities for us Brits is unbearable and you do get charged $15 a day for Wifi it's says it;4
I recently stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker with my husband.  The hotel is very nice, and very central to all Manhattan hot spots.  The Reception staff were very friendly.  The hotel is recently under going a refurb.  We stayed on the 31st floor, the room was ok, quite small but ok for what we needed it for.  You do need a high rom to appreciate a good view.  There is an American Diner next door Tick Tock Diner open 24 hrs, we ate in their for our breakfast and the service/food was excellent.  Set you up for the day!;4
The hotels location is very good... excellent value for money, clean but dated as maybe you would expect in NYC? Rooms were spotless and cleaned everyday, new towels sheets etc... the sheets were pristine white!! The only downside was the fact £380 was taken from my card without any notification for the 'security deposit' which was refunded on check out... it would have been nice to know about it... it could leave some short of spends! Overall a good hotel;4
My wife spent good money on a room with a view but we were stuck in the middle looking at a brick wall and another room. Ladies at front check in basically said nothing can be done. Very small room and old hotel. Location is very close to msg and Penn station.;2
Just back from a week at The New Yorker and loved it.  Had two rooms, a metro queen and a metro double double on the 37th floor with a fabulous view over the Hudson, giving us incredible sunsets!  Both were perfectly adequate in size and we loved the art deco styling.  Our rooms weren't refurbished but they were clean and everything was in full working order. There was a simple heating/air con unit in each room (which we appreciated given it was a very unseasonable 80F) and each room had a safe in the closet.  Our beds were a joy to sleep in - and I had no problem with the 'dated' bathrooms (other than lack of towel rails) - it's called history!!  If you want modern shower cubicles, spa baths and discreet toilets go elsewhere! Wifi also worked perfectly in our rooms - you have;5
"As first time visitors to New York, the choice of accommodation is quite daunting. As is the best area to stay. We plumped for Mid-Town as it was central to all the sites. Our agent then recommended the New Yorker. In terms of location, its perfect. Really close to ESB, Broadway, Times Square, MSG et al. The hotel feels ""well used"" to the point of being a little tired in places. Our room (3432) was quite small and the bathroom was quite dirty (hair in the plug hole), however it was very comfortable and had good views. As this is New York, we weren't in the hotel that much so overall I would recommend the New Yorker. Breakfasts in the adjoining Tick Tock restaurant are fantastic.";4
After a 10 hour train journey from Niagara we were rather ecstatic that the New Yorker was this close to penn station,check in quick,security in front of elevators,all hotel elevators for the hotel are on the right as you approach them as the hotel doesn't start until the 21st floor ok the rooms are small  but the bed was comfortable and the shower was powerful you have to pay the dreaded resort fee we asked for a coffee maker for the room this was delivered as soon as we got to the room,and was supplied with tea bags creamer sugar and Starbucks coffee which was really good having stayed here before in its RAMADA days we knew what to expect but hey location location location WELCOME TO NEW YORK PEOPLE;4
The rooms are rather small for the price.  As a result I do not consider this Hotel good value.  Check in time was 3:00pm,  Many rooms were not available at that time.  I personally do not like a facilities charge which is NOT optional.;3
The hotel lobby was gorgeous in an Art Deco style - there is a little museum downstairs of the history. There are 2 restaurants attached which we didn't get a chance to eat in  The reception is busy but the staff are very polite and helpful. There is a luggage storage area and computers available downstairs for printing boarding passes etc.  Someone checks keys before you enter the lifts to ensure the hotel is secure for guests. There are plenty of lifts so we never had to queue for long.  Our room was on the 36 floor. Unfortunately we did not have views of the ESB or Crystler but it was still exciting to see the city. The room is a little tired but perfectly adequate. It's NYC - all you're going to do is change and sleep. The shower was forceful and hot and the bed was comfy.;4
We stayed in a 2 double bed room, with a great view on the 32 floor. It is a gigant hotel, but it doesn't feel chaotic. There is fast free wifi in the lobby and both a restaurant and a dinner on each side of the hotel. The hotel is located central in walking distance to everything, and very close to both Madison Square garden, 5th avenue, Time Square and Broadway.   The room has aircondition and it is possible to open the windows if needed. The double beds was huge, the mattresses a bit hard, but all in all okay. There is a TV available with a lot of tv canals. The room was small, but we should only sleep in there, and there is a wardrobe closet available, where you can place your suitcases so they don't take up space.;4
The hotel is very well situated at the corner of eighth Avenue and 34th St. Close to Penn station.   Very small rooms with very small beds. We reserved a family room for four persons and it certainly was not big enough. The beds were very small and there were no place to put the suitcases. We stumbled around in the room because the lack of space.  The cleaning was simply not good enough. The room was dirty, and only the beds were made. The sink was constantly dirty and almost blocked. We had to order toilet articles every day, and at no point the housekeepers deliver what we ordered. If we ordered 4 toothbrushes then only 2 came.   We paid extra for the view, but it wasn't worth it.   The fitness room was nice with new machines. However the floor was dirty even  at 6 o'clock in;3
Staff was nice.  Security good.  Room was ok.  Plumbing was not.  Shower would not maintain temp.  No lock on the bathroom but there was one on the closet for some reason.  Toilet was very loud.  No shelf for toiletries.  Overall ok for 2 nights.  Liked the location.;3
"Every time I come to Manhattan, this hotel is within my top 03 options. The hotel has a fantastic location for shopping spots, tourist attractions; dinner options and of course the entertainment (Madison Square Garden, theatre district, etc.). Transportation isn’t an issue either since the hotel is across the Pennsylvania station and directly connected to the rest of the city via subway, buses and private transport services. The hotel is currently ending a renovation made by its new administration; however, the hotel’s exterior still is pending to be completed. Hotel’s staff is quite friendly and always providing an answer to solve most of the guests’ issues. Multilingual staff is also available for foreign visitors (mainly Spanish and Portuguese). Check in time is around 03:00";4
Had a great time and the staff is the best of the best!!!!! Great location for shopping and the theater shows. Had wonderful meals in both restaurants in the hotel. Rooms super clean and beds very comfortable.;5
We had quite a large room with a nice view thanks to Mohammed at the reception desk. The hotel is just a short walk away from Times Square and the Empire State Building, to name but a few places which are a must to visit. Friendly and helpful personnel.;4
"Stayed for three nights with my two teenage daughters in a suite  (two rooms, one with two double beds, one room with a pull out sofa double bed).  Each room had own bathroom, wardrobe storage and tv.   Tea/coffee making facilities not present, but willingly brought FOC on request.   Room was on one of the higher floors, but overlooked other rooms so no city view to speak of.  Decor drab, brown and in need of a facelift but as only used for sleeping was not an issue for us.  Had to request extra bedding for third bed as not prepared (despite booking as three occupants).  Room was clean but not sparkling as decor so tired and brown! And it smelled musty......  Breakfast taken in Tick Tock diner on ground floor; excellent.  Superb location for shopping and sightseeing and always";4
The staff is damn very friendly specially the front desk the way I bother them but patiently gut there answer all my queries and made me satisfy. I highly recommend this hotel to all travelers and the food in restraunt is delicious.;5
As a huge fan of Art Deco this was heaven for me when it comes to decor. The staff was great. The room was always clean. Samira at front desk was lovely and helpful! Give that sunshine a raise!! Down side - it's a very big hotel so you wait a while for an elevator and don't expect much of amenities. Other then that - great.;4
Great stay great people and Susie at the conceier desk when booking was told to bring my AARP card and get additional 20 % off . When we got there told us we should have done it when we booked . We tried to but they refused to take it . I think it was a BAIT and SWITCH  move on YOUR part Not happy with that . I would like a refund for what we were promised The 20% REFUNDED .Please;5
Perfect location for staying in New York!! The hotel in itself is so clean and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful!! We were there the day after the lad street bomb went off.. security at the hotel was great. We felt very safe. Looking forward to a return trip.;5
Location is ideal, staff will do anything to assist with the your stay, regular rooms are small... But if you know this before you go ( as we did) it is not a shock and was not a big deal as we were out doing stuff anyways.;5
This is a reasonably priced hotel (for NYC) in a great location. Close to Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, and Macy's Herald Square.  Some of the streets nearby weren't the cleanest or safest, but overall good area. The rooms are small but recently updated and very nice!;4
Our family stayed at the hotel 4 nights. We could not have stayed more convenient on Manhattan! The hotel is very old, and you can really feel it, when inside. It has a lot of atmosphere though, and it feels very genuine.  The hotel feels a bit run down, but it is clean. The rooms are VERY small - it is actually difficult to even unpack your suitcase. Be aware that staying in the very heart of Manhattan, means that you will be in one of the noisiest places on earth, so if you want calm and silent, this is not a place and hotel for you.;4
We have enjoyed our stays at the New Yorker. The staff has always been accommodating and very helpful. The facility clean and well appointed.;5
The hotel is very nice, clean, well localized, polite personell, good room, good price. New York is amazing, loved to visit, the city doesn't sleep, you breathe culture, fantastic museums, good restaurants and fast food.;5
Amazing hotel. Location is perfect, stone throw away from maddison square gardens. Walking distance to Macys, empire state building and times Square.  View from 34rd floor was breath taking (see pic), room was clean and beds were very comfortable. John on the service desk set us up with woodbury common bus tickets and was really helpful, thanks John 😉. You get asked for a credit card on arrival for the facility charges. I had about £80 pre authorised but only £35 was actually charges to my card. I booked via Expedia and will defiantly try and book here again when I return next year. Thank you New Yorker for a great stay. 💜;5
Near madison square Calm  Nice view on the city Kindness of the staff and very clean October was a good period Quality price Just consider you have to pay about 20$ taxes a day and 24$ a day wifi and fitness access;5
"Hotel looked very nice from the reviews and photos, but the room was small and smelled of cleaning product.  Reserved a room above the 19th floor but was given one lower down.  Also they charged an additional ""resort / service fee"" of an additional $75/night!  Perhaps you can argue it away, but they should be ashamed of themselves for that practice.";2
From the moment we checked into the hotel, we were treated like valued guests. Ruth went out of her way to give us the room we requested. We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building out our window. Megan also showed us such hospitality and appreciation for being Wyndham Reward members. The location of the hotel was great also. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast at the Tick Tock Diner located in the hotel. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel.;5
"The hotels location is perfect, everything is in walking distance. My room was nice and had great view. The staff were friendly, efficient and helpful. The door man Luis was amazing. The hotel restaurant ""Tick Tock"" is great for late nights as it's always open.";4
This is a great hotel as its right across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens.  Also Macy's is just a few blocks away.  It is in Mid Town garment district.  Very safe and is within walking distance to Empire State Building,New York Library,Time Square, and Bryant Park. The subways are just outside the hotel.  The hotel rooms have all been renovated and the staff is very accommodating.  The restaurant in the hotel Tick Tock has inexpensive great breakfasts.  Highly recommend this hotel not only for its location but also price.  Very reasonable for New York.;5
My husband and I have stayed at this hotel every year for 5 years now and have never been disappointed. The hotel is very clean and the staff wonderful. Hope to go back again in the spring. Proximity to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station are certainly a plus and the Tick Tock Diner located within and open 24/7 is so convenient !;5
Great location and classic old New York hotel with lots of history.  The rooms are older but nicely done.  As Wyndham rewards members we were given great service.  Highly recommend this hotel for New York City.;5
Our second stay at the New Yorker was even better than our stay several years ago. We were in an executive room with two beds on the seventh floor. The room was large, newly renovated and well furnished with a desk, sitting area and dresser as well as a closet and nightstand. The bathroom was very small but was adequate for our needs. The walk in shower had great water pressure and hot water. The bath towels and wash clothes were thick and big enough to use.   The hotel's location couldn't be better with the Empire State Building, Macy's, Times Square and Madison Square Garden all within easy walking distance. The Penn Station and Herald Square subway stops are right next door. We felt extremely safe around the motel when walking back even late at night.  The check in and check;5
great view of the hudson, central to everywhere, great diner and friendly staff, whats not to like,,its dated yes but clean, penn station is outside the door and dunkin doughnuts for coffee, your in times square in 4 mins;4
3rd time to this hotel. Once again not disappointed.... booked this hotel a few months ago through Expedia. When we arrived we was a little disappointed with our room, but went and had a word at reception and was given a much bigger room and not charged any extra!!! Staff are so friendly, especially Suzie on the concierge desk (what a lovely, friendly woman) I can not fault this hotel one bit. Rooms are lovely and clean. Great view from our window. One side Empire State Building and the other side Madison square gardens.... although we have not spent a lot of time in our room, it's nice to know we are going to get a peaceful nights sleep when we return in the evenings... if you can stay here I would highly recommend it, as it is the perfect location.....;5
The hotel was clean, staff was very friendly and helpful!  Convenient to everything in the city.  Would stay there again.;5
I have had bigger closets! However, it is a good value and great location. Make sure you ask for one of the renovated floors. Yes, they will try to upcharge you. However I got the upcharge from $40 (as noted by a previous reviewer) to $20. The best part about our room was believe it or not, it was quiet! (#827) Go Back? Probably due to the price.;4
"Right next to Penn station which was handy as we were flying to/from Newark so we could get the train easily.  It's also close to loads of main attractions and shopping.   The queen room was small, but more than adequate and really clean. The only thing I would note is that the housekeeping staff didn't seem to honour the 'green policy'; we had what looked like crisp towels everyday even though we left them on the rack. A minor point as obviously clean towels are great, but not needed every day.   The hotel links to the Tick Tock diner which is fab for breakfast or snacks. Though we tended to get coffee and pastries most mornings from the guy in the lobby. They were reasonable and very tasty, but you have to get there quick as they go fast!  The staff were nice and doormen";4
Hubby booked a last minute trip to NY. We were offered the New Yorker. When we arrived the gave us an upgrade when hubby asked if we were in the referbed  part. We were on the 50th floor . The room was small but nicely done out. It was only to sleep in and store shopping bought. Beds were very comfy and clean towels were there every day. The Hotel is perfect for Madison Square Garden, diagonally  opposite.  Empire State building is a few blocks up,  Macys is just next block up and Times square is near and the High line walkway just behind the hotel. Tick tick diner adjoined to Hotel is a fab place to eat too.;4
Great location  Very very small room 125 sq ft  for one queen bed. Not even enough floor space for our suitcases.i had to use the small desk next to my bed for my suitcase . My husband used the closet for his suitcase but there was no light in the closet. We asked for a bigger room , but it would be an extra $40.;3
I picked this hotel purely for location and for that it didn't disappoint. Essentially walking distance to most places and in between 1,2,3 and A,C,E lines on the subway.   I trawled booking.com until the rate dropped by 50% and then booked about 2-3 weeks before arrival.   The room was tiny and pretty crap but as we were on a high floor the view was great.   We only ate in the Tick Tock diner on the last morning for what was essentially brunch but the food was great and reasonable.   Once is enough for me. Won't be back.;3
The hotel was great!!!! central to everything. Penn station is 2 minute away( walking) . Time square 10 mins. (walking) Great food around the hotel. The hotel has great housekeeping, security staff was very professional. I would go back to this hotel.;5
I love New York. This hotel was great. Good location. Great beds and rooms. Very large hotel, not got the intimacy of some ive stayed at, however the staff were great. The restaurant next door is very easy access without stepping outside!  Find as always staff pleasant and helpful;4
We booked this hotel because it is VERY conveniently located right next to the Penn Station. It was extremely easy to get to the hotel from the airport, as well as getting around NYC from the hotel via the famous NYC subways.  Booking: easy booking of 1 bedroom suite via Wyndham website.  Check in: friendly staff, and it was a bonus that they offered a complementary red wine for celebrating our mother's 60th birthday (who is travelling with us), but we never received the wine.  Room: old and dated room, but relatively clean. Very comfortable sofa bed. Amenities were adequate. We enjoyed beautiful NYC skyline from the 39th floor.  Free wifi. Paid parking and paid breakfast. So we had breakfasts outside, luckily there are lots of good food in close proximity.  Check out:;4
"This was our second stay at the New Yorker and I'm sure it will be out ""go to"" hotel next time we are in NYC. The last time we stayed here we had a disappointing experience with the type of room we were given (too small for two of us and luggage even though it was an upgrade), When we checked in this time I expressed that we needed enough space for two people and four day's worth of luggage and we were offered an executive suite that was much larger for a small additional fee and we were very pleased with it. The staff was really great at check-in, the doormen were helpful in advising about self-parking, directions, transportation, use of the concierge desk, and we used the bellhop twice. While this is a luxury hotel, I don't think that its price was out of line with other New";5
I had a great time at the New Yorker Hotel. Very nice hotel with helpful staff. Classic New York hotel walking distance to Time Square and the Jacob Javitz Convention center.  The only downside was the room was very small, but I had a good time staying there and would stay there again. This was my 2nd stay.;5
There were positives and negatives with this hotel. The positives - GREAT views of the Empire State Building from my room and a central location in the garment district. I did have to switch rooms late at night due to a housekeeping issue. It too the staff a long time to bring keys up for the new room and they did not offer assistance with my bags which I had to move from one building to another. I also prepaid for a valet package. When I went outside to retrieve my car, they told me I didn't pay so I had to drag my bags inside and have the desk clerk come back outside with me to speak with the valet attendant....only to have another fee attached to my folio which I disputed. The hotel was gracious to offer a discount due to my issues (which I did not ask for), so that was;3
We have stayed at this hotel many times and it never disappoints.  Perfect location, great room with unbelievable view, clean, friendly staff, in short what more can you ask?  Look forward to going back!;5
I just wanted to give a shout out to Miguel at the check in desk who was absolutely wonderful.  We were in town celebrating my daughter's best friend's birthday and he made the day much more special.  We were up on the 33rd floor and I had a wonderful view of the Empire State Building.  The room was very clean, the bathroom was very bright, the location couldn't be beat.  The room was a typical New York City hotel size.  Thanks Miguel!;5
Stayed here for 2 nights after sailing from Southampton to San Francisco caught the Amtrak sleeper to Chicago and then to New York.large hotel very comfortable rooms and very friendly staff .not far to walk to Times Square ,Macy's .you can leave your baggage on day of coming home if you have late flights in secure area .also restaurant and diner on site very good food;5
"We got a room for four people, and it was really big for a New York hotel bedroom. It had two bathrooms too, one in each side, right next to the beds (two). I was frustrated a little bit by the fact that there was not a mini fridge in the bedroom, nor a proper closet (just a place where you could put your luggage and hang some clothes, with a small vault). I hated the shower; I don't know if it was only in my room, but the water was very weak and, most of the time, mildly cold. The hairdryer they provide is a joke. But the room in itself was very good, very clean, very proper. The beds were very comfortable. The concierge service was a little bit frustrating; I needed cotton (to remove my makeup) and they didn't have it, and didn't make any efforts to help me find a place where";3
We stayed in this hotel for business earlier this month. The location is perfect for us as it was near where we needed to be for work. The lobby is incredible, a real art deco beauty! We were also incredibly impressed with the staff. It was some of the best service we've received from hotel staff in years. Check-in was incredibly smooth and fast. The gentleman who works in the mail receiving room is amazingly friendly and helped us dispose of some packaging after we'd picked up a large package. The gentlemen who work at the little coffee and pastries stand in the lobby were very welcoming every morning!  The hotel is huge and serviced by multiple elevators, so despite it being a busy time to stay, we never waited too long for one. Our room was small, as is typical of a lot of;4
Stayed for 3 nights with my husband last week and was very happy.  We requested a refurbished room with a view and that's what we got.  Comfy beds, nice room and excellent view of the Empire State Building.  Only negative is that there isn't a mirror by the dressing table.  Really good location, we walked miles but that's because there is so much around.  Hotel staff were all really helpful and polite.  Ate at the diner for breakfast and the pancakes were divine.  Would recommend and would stay there again.;5
The Staff was extremely helpful, the onsite restaurant food was very good and the spacious room was comfortable. A family member need to borrow a wheelchair and the staff was able to provide a nice one immediately. The hotel is located near Penn Station which is very convenient for many NYC attractions.;5
Came to new York for the first time and stayed at this hotel. There was some remodeling going on outside. The  room small and but it was fine, I was going to order a roll in bed but there would have been no space so me and my sister slept In the same bed. I loved the pillows and the security standing by the elevators a hispainc man was very helpful and seemed like a great person.;5
The New Yorker is one of those iconic hotels that you just have to experience. We did and we weren't too impressed. The hotel is showing its age. Wyndham has just taken over so it was still transitioning. Hopefully Wyndham can update the rooms to ensure many more years of business. It's just not going to get our business again for some time yet.;3
We were in NYC only a few hours when an emergency required us to return home.  The hotel manager was extremely helpful and refunded the balance of our pre-paid stay at The New Yorkers.  She made us customers for life that day!;5
Easy access to the sites. Walking distance to Macy's and the center of Times Square.Subway extremely close by. Good value for the area. My first trip to New York and I will definitely return and use this hotel.;5
Easy to access from Newark Airport as Penn Station is just across the street (8th Avenue). Being in the Midtown area it means you can walk most places or go to Penn Station (we preferred the walk as the weather was good). The area surrounding the hotel is a bit seedy with lots of rough sleepers. On checking in were asked to pay a 'resort charge' of $29 per night to give us access to the 'free' wifi and allow international calls. When we questioned this as our travel agent had not made us aware of it, the fee was reduced to $10 per night. The room was comfortable and well serviced throughout our stay. We really only used our room to shower, change and sleep as we wanted to make the most of our stay in the city. There was a small deli one block towards Midtown where we could have;3
This hotel had exceptional and helpful staff. A nice eatery next door and is in a great location. However the hotel is old and run down but very clean and ultimately has everything you'd need. The price was fairly high but thats due to location.;4
Absolutely enjoyed NYC Comic Con. Wyndham Hotel was very easily accessible from Penn Station, which was what we were looking for, given it was centrally located inthe city. Room sizes were definitely much smaller than the photos show on their website. If you are familiar with room sizes on commercial cruise ships, the room sizes will not surprise you. On the upside, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Rooms were quite pricey but given the NYC Comic Con was being held that weekend, it does not surprise me. Next time we travel to NYC we will most likely look around for a better place to stay.;3
When we arrived at the hotel, they were polite and asked about our journey and offered to upgrade our room to a double. When I said I was in New York for a birthday holiday, we were again upgraded to a double room on the 31st floor with a view of the Empire State! Which was a pleasant surprise.  Like everyone else, the location was the one of the best things, as it's right around the corner from Penn station and Madison Square gardens. Making it easy to get there from JFK by getting the air train to Jamaica and then the subway. Easily walkable to places like Times Square, Empire State and the Chrysler building. Plus Macy's is around the corner.  The hotel lobby is beautiful and the whole hotel is very 'art deco'. The room was a decent size and was always clean. All staff were;4
Wow! This place has no soundproofing! If you are a light sleeper or just like a peaceful atmosphere, I would not suggest staying here! You can hear every voice outside like they're right next to you and every flush of a toilet sounds like it should be physically in the room with you it's so loud! The benefit of this hotel is it's very centrally located - close to the train station and easily walkable to everywhere! Additionally, the lobby is gorgeous. Probably wouldn't stay here again!;3
Ideally situated for exploring New York and the shops.  Next to Madison Square Gardens and close to the Empire State Building.  Hotel is impressive and the rooms are sufficient.  We had a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom suite that took 5 of us comfortably.  Tick-Tocks dinner attached is a must for breakfast.  Would definitely stay again.;4
This hotel is less than a block from Penn Station, with entrances to subways around the hotel.  Easy to get to from JFK and Newark (short cheap rail Journey). The New Yorker was built in the 1930's, and has a beautiful lobby, Our room  was on the 34th floor with easy access by 3 lifts which only stopped at floors 31-40 (very Quick).  Comfortable refurbished twin room.  Shower/W.C. room a bit cramped. Macy's is one block one way, The Empire State building one block the other way.;4
The New Yorker Hotel is a beautiful hotel and the location is ideal for visiting New York City.  The staff were always very, very friendly and helpful!  I had a great stay.;5
"When I travel for business, I have to stay at corporate-approved hotels and this was on our list for NYC. Proximity to the subway lines were important to me and this hotel is very well suited for public transit (if the weather were bad, you could even cut through the Tick Tock Diner attached to the lobby to reach the closest subway entrance). My recent stay was for nearly 8 days and my corporate-approved rate only allowed me to book a room with a single bed. At check-in the front desk clerk noticed the length of my stay and ""upgraded"" me to a room with ""more space."" I have stayed in many NY hotels and they typically have very small rooms, but this was one was small even by NY standards - and the clerk said he gave me the biggest room available. I imagine the extra space came in";4
Central and convenient. How can I put it if your the type of person who must shop at Waitrose or Marks, then this isn't the hotel for you. However if you want a good centrally located hotel with views overlooking the Empire State Building then look no further.;4
Very nice hotel in the heart of Manhattan.The rooms are a bit small and old, but are kind of warm. There are locations from where the view is great - though our room looked in the side of the street. The breakfast that served at the place at the lobby, was really awful.  The overall experience was good but eat breakfast somewhere else.;3
With appropriate tight security to get to the lift, The New Yorker by Wyndham is perfect for a short stay in New York. Close proximity to everything from transport (Pennsylvania train station), to shopping, diners, and not too far to the famous Time Square. A stone throw away from Madison Square, and good view of the Empire State Building. Staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful. Room a bit small but clean, functional and comfortable. Overall, a great stay for us.;4
very friendly staff, great diner but pricey cocktails, big room with a view, clean, free wifi and calls, lovely night staff, funny guys and most probably not from ny,new yorker yuppies are awfull, but working class are solid good people, you could not find  better hotel,;5
Went to New York celebrate my wife birthday, I choose to stay at this hotel. The first impression was ok.. busy lines waiting for checking and other line for check out. I arrived early, so my room wasn't available, we have to go out around to come back. When we come back we got the room in a high floor, it was very hard to find the room  on the floor it's very confused also the room was so small..I asked if I could change, front desk said they were full. The hotel in general it's an old building but some parts need to improvement as soon as possible.. I reported to the housekeeper  my sink in the bathroom was stuck and also when you using faucet  from the sink you get wet everywhere... so be careful! .. I called more than 5 times to requested shampoo and extra sets to take a;2
We were needing a central location  for sight seeing, which this was, and also needed two beds, so we ended up at the New Yorker.  It says it has been refurbished, and in many ways it has, but my husband was disappointed in the very small bath with no in room coffee machine, no fridge, and broken porcelain in bathroom fixtures.  It was as if they re-did some aspects and left others.  However, the staff are great, and it is convenient having a diner open 24 hrs downstairs (food not great but OK).  We had  27 th floor with amazing views of NYC;4
My only issue was the heat and AC settings but I put on a sweater when the fan came on.  We were so busy I forgot to report it.  The room was very clean, security good, staff friendly and so well located to everything that we were doing.  We were also part of a road Scholar program;4
Although the hotel is in a good location downtown for site seeing we arrived at the hotel at 12:00pm and our room was not ready until 6:00!!!!! The reception desk kept us waiting forever! We had lunch at the Tick Tock cafe and waited and waited and waited. No one at the desk seemed to know when it would be ready. So we went for a walk up to Central Park to get some frustration out. Although they told me that they would inform us when the room would be ready no one had the courtesy to even bother and inform us. After I personally called they told us that we could go back and go to out room.  I find their attitude completely unacceptable and if I hadn't pre-payed the room in advance I would have left in an instance.  I was so frustrated at the way they blew me off that I made a;3
Beautiful view outside of our window and we didn't have a view room!   We upgraded to the suite as there were 3 of us - two adults and one tween.  That worked great and the room had two full bathrooms and a fridge.  Security checked our room key before allowing us onto the elevators to go to our room.   The room was very clean and the house keeping staff very helpful. The Bell service was awesome to take the luggage and store it while we had a great day on the town.   Check in/out was quite slow.;5
Booked a Queen room and when we opened the door the bed was very small with barely enough room to walk around it.  I went to front desk and was told that beds in the hotel were a little small compared to what we have at home.  Upon looking a little further, the desk agent found out that they had put us in a room with full bed.  They moved us to a queen room in a part of the hotel that has not yet been remodeled. Bed was better but still a very small room. I tried to call for a roll away bed but could not get through to housekeeping or the front desk - both rang busy. I tried repeatedly.  Finally I went to front desk to ask for a roll away.  We went out to dinner and still no roll away. At 11:30 I got through to the front desk and was told that they were really busy with 50 roll;1
"Staff was helpful and courteous. My room was cleaned daily and had no cleanliness concerns. Great Italian restaurant at the hotel. The Tick Tock diner was just OK and service could be better; but a plus that it's open 24/7 and one doesn't have to go outside the hotel for a late bite. Liked the hotels proximity to subway lines and easy walking distance to other city amenities without the 'craziness' of Times Square area. Would definitely recommend to others and will price it out on my next personal trip.";4
We stayed at this hotel in September. The hotel is based near Madison square . Ideally located for Times Square and many other popular tourist spots.  Although we didn't spend much of our time in the hotel (we were non stop visiting New York attractions). The room was clean and comfortable,fresh towels and bedding. Toiletries were provided. Staff were very friendly and helpfull. The hotel has a history and it's Decor is Art Deco. Worth a visit to the basement to view the photos of past guests. Muhammad Ali was here after one of his fights.  Would highly recommend this hotel to people visiting New York.;4
Thank you to everyone at the hotel for a memorable stay. EVERYONE we came in contact with from the person at the desk to the doorman helping us get a cab (in the rain) to the friendly room attendant who smiled and said hello in the hallway we felt very welcomed. A special thank you to the people behind the scenes who were responsible for staging our room for an extra special 15th Anniversary surprise. THANK YOU NEW YORKER TEAM!!;5
We stayed here the weekend of 9/11 in order to attend the 15 anniversary memorial events.  We found the hotel to be very nice and located across the street from Penn Station which made getting around easy.  Beds were comfortable, the room very clean, and large. Any requests to the front desk promptly responded to.  Price of a room was decent considering that we were there for the memorial and a weekend.  I found  security to be tight requiring the showing of room key every time you had to get in the elevator.  This was comforting to me.  I would definitely recommend The Wyndham New Yorker and will stay there on my next visit.;4
Our room was small and the bedroom portion was nicely decorated. The bathroom looked like something from the 40's but it did the job and we had hot water. It was quiet and the elevators were fast. The location is excellent. Walking distance to Broadway, Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station, Times Square and other subway stations. We were charged a daily fee of $30 US for phone, internet and fitness room. This fee was a surprise and was not optional. The safe did not work, but someone came up to fix it.;3
I confess I have a fondness for the New Yorker it takes you back in time and retains some of the elegance of a bygone age. It is well situated, has a friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are smaller than those outside the city but normal for this area. As I said it is not the most modern of hotels but I defy anyone with a sense of the past not to be delighted with it. I make a point of returning to it anytime I visit New York.;5
"Four of us stayed in a double suite (two double beds, separate living room with pull out couch, and two bathrooms) at The New Yorker Hotel for a quick trip to celebrate my daughter's 11th birthday with a Broadway show.    When we arrived, Reachell helped us check in and she immediately wished my daughter ""Happy Birthday"" (I had mentioned this as the reason for our trip when reserving the room, so kudos to the reservation customer service rep for putting this information on our account).    We were lucky that a two bathroom double was available when we checked in (it was an upgrade we had requested).  The rooms were well laid out and spacious for NY hotel standards.  The room had a safe large enough for my laptop (11"" Lenovo), purse, and other small items to be stashed while we";5
After my third stay at this hotel, I must state that the location is the greatest drawcard. the newly renovated section of the hotel is also very good with modern rooms. If you want one of the best steaks in New York at a good price, look no further than the Tratoria based at the New Yorker hotel. In my opinion as a global traveller, simply the best. I didn't quite appreciate the wailing sounds throughout the night made by the sirens of emergency vehicles - not sure actually if every emergency was a real emergency? The pricing for my last stay was significantly high as was other hotels I checked in the city - totally unacceptable. Internet is superb. Hotel has free phone calls internationally but there is a USD 30/day charge for this and internet;5
"Why does this hotel get good reviews? The Pros are obvious -- location. The Cons are too many to list. The lobby may be fancy, the hotel ""historic"", but it is a dump. The rooms are small, and I mean Japanese small. The rooms and halls are dark and dingy. The woodwork and doors are nearly 100 years old and have the paint chips to prove it. The bath fixtures are old and nasty. Paint was peeling in many places in the room. The TV was in such a strange position it was nearly impossible to watch. Maybe to the many many Euro visitors this is an acceptable hotel, but by American standards it is an overpriced flop house. If you are a Wyndham fan, choose the Wingate just a few blocks away.";2
We stayed in the New Yorker hotel from the 25th of august to 1st of September,   We found our stay in the hotel absolutely fantastic.   Front desk was very friendly and put us at ease immediately as it was our first trip to the big apple we were very nervous.   Our room size was adequate for a family of 4, 2 adults 2 children aged 12 and 15.   The shower was always hot and the pressure was like a power shower.   Although the room was a little dated,it was very clean and our view from our window was amazing... We could see Madison square garden and the empire state.   The long was what attracted me as it was proper art deco from the old movies and I wanted the kids to get a wow factor as they entered the building.    There is security in the loby by the elevators who need to see;5
We had a very enjoyable 4 day stay at this hotel which has an excellent location. Walking distance to Times Square, the Hudson River and the Empire State Building and right across the road from Penn Station. Room was a little dated but large and comfortable with a view across to the Hudson River. Would stay there again.;4
The New Yorker Wyndham Hotel is one of the older, but grand hotels, in New York. For what it lacks in elegance, it makes up for it in its art deco architecture. Since it is an older hotel, it needs a cosmetic face lift such as new carpets, paint and overall upkeep. I have no complaints about the staff since they were all courteous, professional and always helpful. My room was small with no view. The bathroom, likewise. No complaints there because I took the least expensive package when I booked my trip to New York. I wasn't expecting much and that's what I got. What I didn't expect was this hotel hosted quite a few luminaries of old and one of them was Muhammad Ali. There is a museum in the basement chronicling their visits. And it is free. But the wifi, fitness room and;4
Everything about this hotel is perfect...  Our first time in New York so wasn't sure what to expect but on arrival we were checked in without a problem.. Room was on 33 floor... Amazing views... Felt like home.. Not one complaint, Macy's just up the street, Madison square gardens opposit, Times Square 5 mins walk away, Central Park 10... If you take advice from trip advisor reviewers ... Take mine and don't hesitate to book this hotel.;5
We stayed 3 nights and the check in receptionist was extremely helpful as our party of 4 wanted rooms on the same floor.  Lovely foyer, with a capable Italian restaurant on one side and a 24 hour diner on the other.   The staff were always very helpful, and we called out help when the battery failed on the safe in the room.  The man came immediately and sorted it out with the minimum of fuss, and actually apologised for asking me to try it to make sure it now worked.  Our room was adequate and always clean but it has seen better days.;4
Look past the fact the hallways and rooms are a little tired, this is an older hotel with great access to the Empire State Building , Broadway and Time Square (15min walk). Subway station to Central Park (5min) and Maddison Square Garden (5min). Our room had 2 bathrooms and a seperate bedroom, with views of the Empire State Building. We had 6 nights and as a family there is a coin laundry 10 min walk around the block in 9th Avenue. This is a key when travelling with kids.;3
A laid back Art Deco styled hotel. Gracious foyer. Plenty of space and friendly staff. It's not a 5 star hotel but it is everything you need. Great location to Penn station. Access to train network very useful. Walk to Central Park  or World Trade Centre site for some exercise. The prices seemed good value to me. Room a bit tight but I didn't pay for a suite. Good place if you are out all day.;5
I stayed here for a week in August and would recommend staying here 100%. It was my first time in New York and I also travelled solo. This hotel was in a brilliant location to site see, being right next to a subway station. It is also close enough to walk to certain areas such as herald square for shopping! All the staff were so friendly, very grateful for my early check in also after a very long trip from Aus! Would certainly stay here again! Loved the basement pictures of the Wyndham's famous past also! I have nothing to fault!:);5
Central location, friendly staff and Tick Tock Diner adjacent. If it was good enough for Muhammed Ali, it's good enough for me !! Watch out for the automatic gratuity in the bar !! Pay for each round of drinks as they arrive !!;4
We've just spent 6 nights at this lovely Grand Dame.  Stunningly located directly opposite Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, and around the corner from B+H PhotoVideo (You get a discount voucher on your room key-card, use it!) We were on the 28th floor, and kept the TV on to block out the distant noise of sirens and NYK traffic. It was a smallish room - but a decent sized bed/decent pillows, bath/shower, basin and toilet.  Could probably do with some 'lightening up', as it was a little dark, but it was just what we needed for our hectic visit. A kettle with tea/coffee in the room would have been a big help and saving, as Manhatten is very expensive. I don't like that you have to contribute 'Spa' tax, as we were there on holiday, and never even saw the gym (or needed it!).;5
An Art Decor foyer and an American 24 hr Diner at one end and Italian at other, located right beside Penn Station on 34th and 8th Avenue.   An old fashioned hotel with some history, located virtually beside Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station and short walk to Macy's and Empire State Building.  Easy direct access from the Airport to Hotel at around 12.75 dollars by using JFK Airtrain to Jamaica street and then connecting to LIRR to Penn Station which again is a land train and not subway.   New Yorker is well located  on 34st and 8th Avenue and easy 15 minute stroll to 42nd St and Times Square.  The rooms are a tad small and old fashioned but all clean and towels and room cleaned every night .  Guest services are attentive and good security for access to lifts and rooms.  As;4
Nice stay. Request one of the higher floors, 20th or higher - they are newly renovated. Close to Times Square and Broadway. Perfect location for Madison Square Gardens events, it's right across the street. 24 hour diner connected to hotel.;4
I spent 4 days and three nights at this hotel and it was every bit of the money well spent. I got to view so much history of the city and the visitors whom have come through this hotel. If , I have anything to mention it was be the cleaning staff were not as great as I would have liked but I would still give them 4 instead of a 5 did not leave enough supplies. I felt close to everything I wanted to see even if we walked it was never to far.;5
The location was perfect. We could walk from the train station and had easy access to subways. The décor of the hotel is stunning and our room was quiet and beautiful. This will always be our first choice hotel in NYC.;5
Great location,  fantastic staff, well appointed rooms. Nothing but praise here. Used the business center which was very convenient,  great security and 2 convenient restaurants. Concierge was very helpful as it was my first time in new York.  Will certainly return.;5
I can't imagine a much better location for a classy hotel. Near Times Square, Hell's Kitchen, Restaurant Row, Madison Square Garden, Radio City, etc. the associated restaurants were great and the service was impeccable. Drais (sp?) at the front desk was amazing. Very helpful. The place was very clean. The only complaint was that the rooms were VERY cramped with microscopic bathrooms. Oh well.....the bed was comfortable;4
The hotel is dated, the rooms are extremely small, old carpet, one bedside table only, bathrooms too old, and worst of all it is extremely noisy. I know the location close to Madison Square Gardens and theatres is a busy one, but new Windows could certainly make a difference.  The Art Deco style of the Lobby etc is not enough to cover for all the deficiencies. A lot needs to be done Very nice personel at the reception;2
Located within steps of Madison Square Garden, our room was cozy, comfortable and remarkably affordable.  Check in was a breeze and the staff provided great recommendations for local restaurants.  Parking is available around the corner from the hotel entrance.;5
"We went to NY for a week, and wanted to stay somewhere central, close to the theaters and subway. This hotel is kitty-corner from Madison Square Garden. It's a beautiful, busy, bustling hotel with a grand old lobby and historic exhibit in the basement. The staff is friendly, and immediately ""upgraded"" us to the newer part of the hotel. The room was larger, but not by much, the bathroom updated - but it was on the 7th floor, with no views. We requested to be moved back to what we booked - a room with either a view of the Hudson or the Empire State Building. A little older, smaller, but clean and comfortable - if you require a large TV - this is the big difference - the newer room has larger 50+ in TV's whereas the older room had a 32 in TV - we didn't spend much time in the room";4
"The hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Great welcome after an 8 hour flight. Did get an upgrade to a room with a view of South Manhattan so could see No 1 World Trade Centre and Brooklyn. Room was small but normal for New York. The attention to detail in the decor and furnishings was amazing. Some tatty bits in the hotel but with the number of rooms not surprising as maintenance will be constant. Only complaint would be bigger towels please; bath sheets and larger hand towels. If you get in on an evening flight plenty of local cheap food. Penn station is also only a couple of minutes walk away.";5
"The best thing about this hotel is location - right in the thick of it and subway on the doorstep! Lots of elevators so no waiting around to get to your room. Staff generally polite and helpful although we did have to wait 45+ minutes for toilet roll when insufficient for 24h left in the room when cleaned in the morning. Room was pretty small and pretty basic - apart from the lobby pretty much all communal areas and certainly our room were in need of redecorating and updating. Despite the age however everything seemed pretty clean. Overall we had a good stay but be aware of the ""mandatory facilities fee"" of $45 a day which was not in the small print of the website we booked through- maybe expected by US citizens but we certainly didn't expect it on top of their high rate. Not a";3
We just recently had a four night stay at this hotel and loved it! The staff was friendly and very helpful. If we ever needed anything or had any questions they were all ready to help with a smile! The rooms were clean, but they were small. We did not mind the size of the rooms as we were only in there to sleep anyway. The location was great and very convenient for getting around the city to all the sites and shopping. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again!;5
A very nice hotel, the staff were great and very friendly. Only 8 or so blocks away from Times Square. The room was one of the recently renovated rooms located on the 30th floor. We choose the AAA continental breakfast package with a view of the Hudson.    The continental breakfast was great during the week up in the 39th floor. Very good with a variety of juices and pastries.  But, on Saturday, in the Tick Tock diner, the food was good, but service was questionable. We were seated at a dirty table. The staff waited on all the regular tables before us. In fact the table of 4 that was seated after us, received their entire order before we received coffee.   We did not get the view we requested. And the hotel does not guarantee a specific view, but they state they will try to give;4
My favorite place to stay :) Nice hote, I felt safe and it was very clean.   It is less than 2 blocks to Penn Station for Amtrak, Subway to Central Park to North and 911 Museum to South and accrues from a Big Bus Tour stop.  Great in house Diner and nicer dining restaurant.  Great pizza, nice McD's and CVS  across the street.;5
We stayed here for three nights last week.. The only thing that saves this hotel from a 1 star is its location.  1- room sizes are extremely small. Cannot even move around without bumping into someone or something.  2- Extremely old. Needs upgrading.  3- Bathrooms and closets are tiny just like the rooms 4- Hallways have an old dingy smell 5- $29.00 a night fee? for what no one knows  6- Charge $4.00 per luggage bag to hold it if your flight is after checkout. (not sure why the $29.00/ night doesn't cover this?  i will not be rebooking this place. Like the title, there is nothing special and it is over priced. Seems like there is not much you can do at hotels like this anyway but they need to stop charging the $29.00 a night for amenities like the business center and the gym;3
Great location: Madison Square Gardens just across the road, Macy's around the corner and the Empire State Building just up the road.  Times Square is a short walk away.  Right opposite Penn Station too, so transfer from JFK a breeze - if you're not loaded down with luggage, it will save you a fortune coming into Manhattan by Airtrain.  Rooms are small, with little storage, but if you're here to see the sights, don't worry about it.   For me it wasn't a deal breaker.  The lobby is beautiful but the rooms are quite shabby in comparison.  It's a hotel with a great history though, (Tesla once lived here) and some incredibly big 'names' have stayed, held major events here or been associated with the hotel in some way.   Views from the higher floors are amazing, especially at night.;4
For the price, it wasn't worth it. The main reason why we booked this hotel, was because it was close to our event (NYCC). Our room was on the 33th floor and they have many elevators to accommodate the many floors. Room was quite small and so were the bathroom and closet. The biggest let down was the lack of a microwave anywhere in the hotel.  Food, stores, and things to do all around so that was another great thing about this hotel. I did find the old tiled floors and ceramic tub/toilet interesting as well.   Oh we didn't have a view either. Sure, the Hudson river can be barely seen but our main view was the top of another part of the hotel. I'm sure there were rooms with great views but sadly ours wasn't one of those rooms.;3
Definitely stay here if you want a great location! The hotel room we stayed in had seen better days, but it was clean and the cleaning staff was on top of their game. The lady at the concierge desk was wonderful. She helped us figure out the best way to spend our short time in the city and we were able to pretty much do what we came to do. We walked off the train and our hotel was just up the street. Times Square just a few blocks. We didn't have to use any public transportation except tours because the location was perfect!  Ate at the restaurants in the hotel and they we great as well as the pizza across the street!  Overall very happy!;4
"The hotel is very convenient for the frequent travelers. The rooms are very small, but that is typical of old buildings in New York. Some rooms don't have much of a privacy because of the other buildings across the street with ""ten thousand"" apartment windows facing you, but some could find it somewhat entertaining.";3
excellent hotel 1930 style loved it upgrade on our room on arrival staff helpful  ideal location beautiful views from rooms would recommend and will return there again service always somebody there to help and advise;5
Everyone except the bell hop was unfriendly and very unhelpful. The location is the sole reason I would stay again. The hotel overall was not a good experience. The room was clean and the hotel was easily accessible but the staff was terrible. They told me shuttles were available but gave me conflicting information and I ended up paying for an Uber.;3
We stayed for a five nights with my sister. On arrival the receptionist automatically upgraded us to a two double beds rooms. When I mentioned my sister birthday also got upgraded to a room with a view of the empire state and crysler for free. Great base for travelling round New York and transfer from jfk. You will need to take air train to Jamaica and then LIRR train to penn station (runs frequently and only $12 for the journey takes about an hour to the terminal) then a couple of mins walk from there. Good diner in the hotel which locals used as well. Overall great stay and would recommend.;4
Chose the New Yorker because it offered the best rates for my stay in Sep 2016. Comparable hotels were slightly or significantly more expensive.  Booked room with a city view overlooking 8th Ave. Smaller than expected but had most things I needed: climate control, separate closet for clothes & luggage, clean bathroom, good shower, desk space & chair. Crucially, the windows can be opened 10 inches or so to let in fresh air. In-room safe sufficient for mid-sized laptop, passport, valuables. Very good WiFi but no in-room fridge or kettle for coffee/tea.  Within 2 minutes' walk or less are a Macdonalds, a few pizzerias, 2 Starbucks, a 24/7 CVS and DR pharmacies, several shops selling electrical adaptors for UK/Continental plugs. Essentially, everything one would need on a first;5
My husband and I went to New York for a podcast.  We stayed at the New Yorker because of its rich history.  Nikola Tesla stayed here in Room 3327 and you can still book his room.  The hotel positively gleams.  The fixtures are all polished to a high degree and the marble floors glow.  All of the staff were wonderful from the woman who checked us in to the bell hop who stored our luggage so we could explore the city for a few hours after we officially checked out.  The elevators were roped off and you needed to show your key to access them so you could get to your rooms.  The rooms were compact and immaculately clean with art deco trim on the light fixtures and the dresser.  I was tempted to try to bounce a quarter off the bed when we arrived because the sheet were so taunt.;5
"We enjoyed our stay very much. The gentleman that greeted us at reception was very nice and helpful.  We allowed us to upgrade at no extra charge, he gave us a room with a view of The Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden. We had reserved a Queen-Bed room but he said these rooms tend to be small, so he suggested two Full beds and we were not disappointed. We were on the 8th floor. When we entered our room it was very clean and cozy. The bathroom was a bit small, but I guess this is normal for these vintage/historic hotels in the city. The street noise was of no bother to us; noise was not an issue during our stay. The lobby is beautiful and the restaurant downstairs was very good, too.";5
When I visited the New Yorker by Wyndham I was expecting a very nice hotel, I was sorely disappointed. The room was small and cramped with the decor that haven't been updated for decades. The room service was delivery from the Resturant downstairs and the food was garbage. The parking was $60/ day valet & $40/day self parking... I understand that NYC is expensive but do you really have to rip people all the way off in broad daylight??  The employees were very helpful except for the doorman on the day before of my arrival, he was MIA and had to hunt him down to get my car parked. Next time I'll look a little harder for a better place to stay.;2
Bites on back, chest, forehead.  Took off the pillowcase, the pillow looks like it is original from when the hotel went up before WWII.  Tired, small, room.  Stay away. The history is interesting, but this is well past it's prime.;1
Loved  the view from our room.  Room was older but very clean and comfortable.  Bathroom was very old and small but very clean. Loved the location. Not to close to Time Square with all the crowd but close enough for a walk there. It was perfect for our needs.  Would stay there again.;4
We did not know there was internet available.  Should have been told at check-in.  People were very friendly and helpful!!!;5
Went for a couple of nights to see a show, some famous paintings and the rebirth of World Center. Hotel has kept its old charm whilst the remodeling has been done so well. Really enjoyed our stay there. Good location for the whole of Manhattan. Not too much in restaurants nearby but the restaurant attached to the hotel is really good with great dishes and modest prices. Helpful friendly staff. Good security to rooms;5
I took my elderly parents for an overnight New York city tour. I chose The New Yorker Wyndham for its location and price. We got an upgrade on our room upon check in. The room was neat and tidy with excellent amenities. The hotel staff made sure that my parents could use the facilities even after check out. The Tick Tock diner is an added bonus and a hidden Midtown gem. The hotel would be my recommendation to anyone looking for good, affordable and efficient accommodation in the heart of New York City.;5
very good clean room. small but what can one expect in nyc. the only problem was the way the room was cleaned Sunday., wasn't up to par with the rst of the stay.;5
So convenient to the Amtrak station, an 8 minute walk. We could see the Chrysler Building out our window, great view! The rooms are very small, but that is to be expected in New York. Great nightly rate, super comfy beds and great water pressure in the clean, but retro bathroom.;5
I stayed at the New Yorker  for five nights last week and could not have faulted it. A lovely welcome on arrival, all staff very friendly throughout the stay. A beautiful hotel, very Art Deco and spotless. Our room was cleaned everyday and towels changed. Plenty of elevators for guests to use. Tick Tock Diner is good value for money. Location is great with Penn Subway on the doorstep ( this is great value for money and I would highly recommend as a means of getting around the city), also Maddison Square Gardens The Empire State Building and Macy's on the doorstep. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city. The only down side for me was no tea/coffee facilities in the room ( though I am sure if I had asked this could have been arranged). I didn't though as you can;5
Booked through Expedia  and was given a crappy room. Check in reported that t we did not have a request for a view but not an option through Expedia. Checked in on time and on the 33 floor. Room was probably 12 x 12, and was in ok condition. Bathroom very outdated. No view of anything and looking at a brick wall. Asked to move and put in same room several floors down, Newly renovated but same shoebox. Staff very nice and suggested that we speak to them in the morning and they would try to accommodate us with a better view and larger room. Good location. Bed very uncomfortable with a dent in the middle. No king size beds at this hotel. I would NOT return to this hotel.;2
The hotel was perfect for our needs. The only complaints we have are ones that can't be fixed so we won't even mention them. Our room had a perfect view of the Empire State Building and Times Square. The location was fantastic! We will be staying here on our next visit!!!!;5
Excellent location for walking to main attractions. Right by Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and Empire State Building. Excellent service at the hotel and a very nice room. Good restaurants near by.;4
The lobby and room were nice with the exception of the bathroom which was extremely dated. There was a very loud fight going on in our hallway, and i called the front desk a few times because I was worried someone would be seriously injured. I really dont think they sent anyone, or were worried, as the fight kept going long after the initial phone call. Also, the hallway smelled like weed. Overall though, it was worth the price for a downtown New York City Hotel.;3
The New Yorker was built in 1929 & still has the Art Deco original feel to it (renovated since of course) There are loads of elevators, reception staff are friendly & John who arranges transport was brilliant. The rooms are small but clean & nicely decorated. The bathrooms are still dated but clean, don't let this put you off this iconic hotel. We had a free bottle of champagne as it was our honeymoon. Didn't try the bar/restaurant but used the Tick Tock diner every day which had a good range of food with a bar.;4
I stayed in the New Yorker on my last trip and liked it so much it was the obvious choice for this one! From Newark airport we got a train straight to Penn train station which is situated across from the hotel (very convenient!) the location of the hotel is brilliant, subway station across the road, Macy's one block away, food options surrounding the hotel. Our room was amazing, it was huge for three of us and we had a view of the Empire State Building! The room was very clean as is all the hotel, the beds are the comfiest I've ever slept in! All staff are very helpful and friendly. Security check your room key everytime you enter the hotel which I like, keeps you feeling safe! The only bad points, upon checking in I was told I had to pay the per room per night fee for things;5
"Great place to stay friendly .best bed ave ever slept in .tick tock dinner fab.can""wait to go back .rockafeller building was fantastic.great views.hop on hop buses not bad .but can be long .done a boat trip around ellis island' and statue of liberty .amazing veiw of brooklyn and new Jersey.";4
My partner and I travelled to NYC for a 5 night break to celebrate my 50th birthday.  Arrived at the hotel and were greeted by friendly reception staff.  Our room was on the 26th floor and overlooked the Empire State Building which was a short distance from the hotel.  Although the room was small it was clean, it had a Queen size bed, ensuite, tv and phone.  What more would you need?  The New Yorker is midtown and close to many tourist attractions - Madison Square Gdns, Empire State, Broadway, Macy's, Times Square to name a few.  Penn station is literally across the street and gives easy access to the subway to visit Uptown and Downtown NY.  There is a gym and a 24hr diner 'Tick Tock's, an Italian bar Trattoria Bianca all within the hotel.  The staff on the information desk were;4
Excellent hotel with everything you need for a visit to New York.  Close to Penn station as well as times Square and Broadway.  would stay her on my visits.;5
This hotel is located close to Penn station so good access to transportation to all NYC attractions.  Close to shopping and restaurants.  The room was clean and adequate though small.  Also, there is a  breakfast room on the 39th floor with spectacular views of the city.  The breakfast food was adequate and complimentary.  It had a nice workout room on the bottom level.  Would stay there again. The staff was friendly and happy to answer any questions we had.;4
Just back from New York, booked this hotel and we were not disappointed. Lovely room plenty of space, nice clean bathroom again plenty of room. Hotel good location for Times Square, Macey's and lots of other places. Fab hotel really enjoyed our visit here staff very friendly and helpful. Would book this hotel again no probs. Thank you Wyndham New York staff for a great stay in your hotel.;4
Due to a sudden bereavement, this was not our originally booked hotel, as it wasn't available, but location of The Newyorker is brilliant! Our window overlooked Madison Square Garden! Couldn't have been better for the subway, it was just at the side door, and the main Penn Station was across the road! Our time here had unfortunately been cut down by a day, but we got here, and the staff at the hotel are all excellent, from what we experienced anyway.  It is definately Art Deco in its furnishings, but rooms were lovely and clean, comfy bed and nice big TV, your not in it that long anyway! Would definately consider it again, if on location alone.;3
Hubby and I stayed here for an overnight in NYC.  I was a bit nervous about a hotel so close to Penn Station.  However, it worked out beautifully!  The building is a truly historic NYC site.  Definitely, visit the bottom level to learn more about the building's history.  The Art Deco building has retained its style and history.  All the staff we dealt with were friendly.  Our room was small, but it was all we needed.  It was modern and clean and gave us a place to sleep at night.  The location worked out well for midtown activities.  We walked a TON while in the city, and we were able to walk to everything we did from the New Yorker.  Didn't need a cab or subway for anything.;4
Advertised as a boutique in midtown? Nice location for tourists and to get around. Booked through their site. Two beds on the 8th floor. Unbelievably small bathroom. not enough room to turn around. Staff courteous. Worst restaurants in midtown stay away!!!!! just not above average in any way. Price was in line with NYC but very few amenities. would not stay there again. The view was an airshaft.;3
We booked this hotel through Priceline thinking that it was a great deal. It was advertised as a 4 star hotel. I arrived extremely early that day so I left my suitcase and proceeded to give my information to the hotel clerk. I asked her if she could provide us with a room with a view and told her that the highest the floor the better thinking that it would be a better option. I was so wrong! First, let me tell you that while she took my information she started complaining to her coworker how difficult her job was and how it was to accommodate all the guests that have the same type of the request because apparently everyone wants a view...I politely asked her to do the best that she can as I was going to check in later in the day and maybe a good room would be available by that;3
Chose the New Yorker for proximity to Madison Square Garden - perfect! And with a late night diner for after the concert. Small but spotless room and we were treated to a behind the scenes tour by the hotel historian.;5
The lobby is very grand in this hotel so the upper floors and our room was a bit of an anticlimax! I understand they are undergoing some renovation and in the common areas on our floor (21) this is clearly needed. Our room was great for what we needed, they have tried to stay true to the Art Deco theme so it definitely isn't a super slick modern hotel but I thought it was charming. The room was a little small but suited us, as was the bathroom. It was all very clean and we had new towels every day. The bed was small but so comfy! So much so my husband wanted to find out where the pillows were from! As often happens in hotels there wasn't many plug sockets / or they were in strange places, plus there wasn't a mirror above the dressing table, it was on the other side of the room;4
This was my 4th stay at The New Yorker and would not stay anywhere else. The service and location is excellent and the Tick Tock diner is a perfect place to have breakfast and dinner. Cannot fault. The only thing with this visit was paid for a view room and the room didn't have a view and was quite small. Have been lucky with rooms in the past which is why I keep going back! Have already booked my next stay for May 2017. The views are amazing so I have everything crossed.;4
I was in the city overnight - took the train in from NJ.  It was very convenient to be close to Penn Station.  Good alternative to driving in and paying for parking.  The room was clean and the Housekeepers were very friendly.;4
Great room, excellent staff to help with any requests.  Needed extra towels since we were in suite, and ran out of towels.  They provided them, with an extra pillows.  Enjoyed the trip with several friends.;5
Enough of the original building, and its fittings, remain to evoke a sense of that quintessential art deco New York of the 1920s and 30s. Emerging from the wonderful brass fronted elevators into the magnificent foyer, before exiting directly into the bustle of downtown New York, it is just possible to experience a flavour of those heady days.  However, it seems that some of the opulence of the age has been lost, and the hotel would appear to be in the midst of an extended, and much needed, re-fit.  My room was adequate as were front of house services, but, perhaps, left something to be desired if this hotel is to live up to its location and its glorious past.   The domestic staff, on the other hand, were magnificent, super friendly and extremely helpful ( they might be able to;4
"Front desk agents very helpfulNd friendly, my room was located on the 7th floor,small room but very clean, i asked a room attendant that was cleaning next door if i can get two extra bottles of water and she was so nice and kind giving me a nice smile gave it to me without hesitation, then i went back to my room and grabbed 5 dollars to tip her but she said ""its ok sir you dont have to tip me"" but i insisted until she took it her name was Jessica such a nice young lady always smiling, doormen always trying to help you and location is great, MSG around the corner and few minutes away of Empire State Building...deff going to come back.";5
I have stayed at this hotel several times and it's a perfect location!  The concierge was very helpful, he recommended a wonderful Italian restaurant and made the reservation for us, we were seated very quickly on a night when they were booked solid.  He also got us great tickets to a show we wanted to see.  The room was newly remodeled and very comfortable!;5
Hotel is a great location, staff were very friendly and helpful  All went down hill when we entered our room- for what we paid never been in hotel with a room so small - glad it was only one night  Will not stay here when we return to New York in a weeks time;2
We were here for business and for the Adele concert.  Strolled to the concert with ease. Perect location for our stay. Convenient to shopping with Macy's just down the street. Had a few issues with taxi service, i.e. ability to get service and staff was not as helpful in this department as we had hoped.  We usually had to flag our own.    Rooms are small but to be expected in NYC and for location this is a great value.;4
Can't beat location. Proximity to Penn Station made this very easy to get to when I arrived. I walked to the hotel. Also, centrally located to get to Times Square. Hardly any yellow Taxis. Need Uber. I was surprised at how old the hotel looked once inside. The rugs are very old and worn. However, there was no musty smell.  The room was clean and small as expected. No mini bar. No water for the guest. Ice machine on another floor. Staff were nice. I liked the extra security at the entry of the elevators. Ate at restaurant for lunch, Bianca (right off hotel) and I thought it was good.;3
Amazing location, decor, and staff. Rooms were on smaller side but I'm the type of traveller that doesn't spend a lot of time in the room so it wasn't a big deal. After spending the day pounding the pavement, it was nice to relax in a nice clean room with a very comfy bed! Price was very decent for where it's located and I would definitely stay here again! The location was definitely a big seller for me - and tons of great places to eat late at night after a night on the town!;5
37th floor, looking at 2 great sites (Empire & Chrysler Bldg), for a budget Mcdonalds across the street, diagonal to Madison Square Gardens where the VMAs were held just a week after my visit where Ty Dolla Sign and others performed in the street in front of the hotel. Also parking is very close and Penn Station subway. 10 minute walk to Time Square, 5 minutes to Empire State Building.;4
Very good location..Front desk staff very friendly..Tick tock dinner waiter  didn't think we tipped him enough,,standard 18%,,he wanted more.Close to everything..Refrigerator cost us $20.00 more for stay.Over all loved hotel and staff.Safe was free...we had 4 rooms,,;5
If you have a very small cat you could probably just about swing it in here ! Room was minuscule. Very expensive too . Lobby wonderful and that was were it stopped , public areas around lifts on our floor was dingy and had a strange smell . All in all not as advertised .;2
Would recommend this hotel purely for the location. It is right near Madison Square Garden, basically opposite it. Me and my brother visited and had the room 1945, which included a view of the empire state building and it was incredible. It is also near times square. Overall perfect location. The hotel itself felt like an apartment, no B&B so you have to get up and leave to eat out, which isn't that much of a problem. You also have to show your key card as soon as you walk in before you get the lift to your floor. The rooms were clean and me and my brother were pleasantly surprised we both had a double bed each. The shower on the other hand wasn't the most comfortable, the heating was fine but the bath itself that you stand in just wasn't comfortable. The shampoo and conditioner;4
The check-in associate was extremely helpful and accommodating to my specific needs. She handled everything professionally and had a warm and pleasant personality. Unfortunately, during guest were evacuated to the lobby, then outside due to a exhaust-type of smell on the 37th floor. However, the hotel staff handled everything with professionally and with care for their guests. The kept things calm and made sure guest were supplied with bottle water. For such an inconvenience, I have to applaud the efforts of the entire staff!;3
I stayed here last week. I got the email for upgrading my room for extra few bucks. THE EMAIL CLEARLY STATES that the upgraded room will be having Stunning NYC views of the Empire State Building or the Hudson River.    After i paid extra bucks for the upgrade..I got the room on 27th floor. But the room has no view of Empire state building nor of Hudson river..I could have stayed in the ordinary room without any view. The view I got from my room was just of an apartment building..In fact we got the room facing opposite to Empire state building..No way we can get the view of it from my room...Was very disappointing..Wasted my money on a upgrade which was no where an upgrade..My family was totally disappointed with the room. They didnt even had the drinking water in the room..nor a;2
My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Extremely comfortable bed! Room was a fair size, it had a comfy chair as well as the desk chair so the two of us could sit to play a game. The bathroom was cramped and lacking counter space but we managed. It's close to some good pubs/restaurants (The Beer Authority was a favorite!). Plus the Tick Tock dinner in the hotel itself was excellent! (The Lemon Ricotta and Raspberry pancakes were awesome!) Walking distance to Times Square, The Intrepid and Theaters. And Penn Station was right across the street! We would definitely stay there again!;5
When we checked in they provided a card for a room, which did not exist on that floor!!!  I complained than we got a card for room but the card was not OK! It was really a bad start on behalf of the hotel staff.  We stayed in here for 4 nights. The double room was small. This a tourist hotel because you could get wherever you want to go. E.g. Empire State Building. You can have breakfast on the groundfloor and there is an Italian restaurant as well.;3
Perfect location, great room views and walking distance from many sights. Friendly staff and check in/out fast and easy.  Coming from Europe and being on a different clock, I was very surprised and delighted to find a breakfast room open 5 in the morning. Traditional american menu with pancakes, eggs, burgers and the lot for breakfast. Great way to start the day! Very cool diner style interior as seen in movies, I would not have raised an eyebrow if Travolta walked in with a gun. Cool hotel logo font!;4
Stayed here on family vacation last November. Awesome view of empire state. Ideal location for sightseeing. Lovely staff. Kids loved Tick tock diner in hotel. Awesome experience. Thanks for the memories!;5
Great hotel some people think it's dated however we thought it was full of charm . We will stay here again.The location is superb right in the Heart of the City.  Attached to the hotel is the tick tock dinner great for Breakfast .;4
We stayed at this hotel for 7 days. My stay was satisfactory, the staff is very friendly. Also the hotel is located close to several landmarks on New York as Time Square, the Empire State Building and Station Penn. There are also several shops for shopping.;4
We booked through a travel agent for 1 night prior to joining a cruise. I had specified twin beds at time of booking. On arrival we were given a tiny room on the 8th floor at the rear of the hotel. There was barely room to walk round the small double bed, and the bathroom was small and cramped. When I asked to change rooms I was told it was not possible as the hotel was full. I showed them my booking confirmation showing single rooms requested. The receptionist said requests could not be guaranteed. I always book single beds as I am a poor sleeper especially after a longhaul flight. We both had a restless night's sleep in the tiny double bed. There was no tea supplied with coffee maker.But we did have a decent hot power shower. We ate in the Tic Toc diner twice which was good;3
We paid  more than our usual for a three night visit and got the suite overlooking the Hudson.   They didn't tell us our two windows would be totally blocked with scaffolding,  broom, tarps, cement debris. My husband waited in line at the front desk to try and change our room.   They kept putting him off to come back later.   We came back after a tour the second day and everyone in the hotel was out on the side walk due to a elevator fire.   The security was very good.  You had to show your room key to get to the elevators.  The suite was nice, full dining room table, couch and chairs,  two tvs,  a wet bar.  But the bathroom was very tiny and cramped.  They never changed our room after all the waiting in line.  They finally gave us $20 off per night and took off the facility;2
This was my first trip to New York so this is my only NYC hotel experience. The hotel is well located next to main subway lines that can be used to access the entire city. Beautiful lobby. Very helpful staff. Good security at elevators. Two restaurants on first floor. Elevators were fast and during 5 days only experienced one elevator too full to board. I was on the 21st floor. Did not have a great view, other rooms were probably much better. Beds were VERY comfortable (not hard) and the AC worked well during the heat of early September. Only amenities were a flat screen TV and a hair dryer. Not a lot of room for luggage as the double bed room was small. No space for bath equipment in bathroom - recommend hanging toiletries bag.;4
We stayed at the New Yorker for a week in September 2016. After losing my luggage and dealing with some really unhelpful airline staff our trip didn't have the best of starts.   We had booked a city view room, but when booking in the Manager explained that this only meant it would be a certain level and above, not that we would be guaranteed a great view. With our disappointment obvious the Manager (Chris Brown I think) asked our preferred view, to which we replied the Empire state. He asked us to leave it with him that night and return the next day and he'd see what he could do.  On our 2nd day not only did I get my luggage back, but as promised Chris Brown relocated us to another room. The room was bigger and brighter and had the most amazing views of the Empire State, the;5
Staying here in New York in September. Huge centrally located hotel with good facilities. Allocated room that was so noisy we couldn't sleep...literally. Went to reception and asked to be moved...no problem at all and was allocated an upgraded (and very quiet) room on night 2. Hotel is being upgraded but is clearly an iconic building. Really great location, exceptional staff and look forward to returning when all rooms have been upgraded!;4
"I arrived at New York Penn Station by train at about 9am on a weekday morning, and I was very pleased to find just how close the hotel was to the train station. Excellent location! Unfortunately, my room wasn't quite ready yet, but the very friendly staff member at the front desk was able to do a ""pre-check-in"" for me. She suggested I come back around noon, so I left my luggage at the bell desk and headed out. When I came back over lunch, the line was a little long at noon for check-in, so it took about 10 minutes of waiting before I was helped. Fortunately, I got to deal with the same person as earlier that morning (I wish I'd gotten her name!) who got me checked in right away.   I didn't get to see my room until later that night, but it was quite nice. On the small side, as";4
Stayed here for 8 days in August 2016. Good sized room for 2 adults and 2 pre-teens. Bathroom small with old fittings. The overall decoration of the room was okay but hadn't been updated in a long time. We booked a room with a view and we were not disappointed. Incredible vista from the 32nd floor. Staff were efficient and friendly but nothing special. Location is excellent - very practical if very busy outside (it is New York though!). Overall, I would recommend this hotel based on location, views and exceptional value for money but with the proviso that the room we stayed in was in urgent need of updating.;3
I got a pretty good deal on this hotel on Priceline Express.  However, they didn't tell me I would be paying $60 more for the ridiculous resort fee.  Seriously what does this get me?  My wifi was spotty and not worth $30/night.  At least throw in some free water or something.    So I have no issues with personnel, front desk was friendly, bag check friendly, though again charging to store my bag is really nickel and dimeing when every other hotel I've stayed at is free.  The rooms are tiny, that's fine I wasn't there for more than sleep and a shower.  But thats where the problem comes in.  The bathroom was incredibly dated and didn't feel clean.  The water kept dripping from the faucet in the tub no matter how much I tightened them.  Time for an upgrade I'd say.  Oh and I had a;3
The New Yorker is a very nice hotel in a great location and is perfect for a trip to NYC.  It does not have much in the way of restaurants or bars, but the neighborhood more than compensates for those defficencies.;4
This hotel was located in a great position to make the best of New York City. The staff in the hotel were so helpful. The hotel was beautiful. The water pressure was amazing, an exfplaiting shower and to run a bath was so quick.;5
I chose this hotel for a weekend break in the city during a 2 week business trip to New Jersey. I wanted an Art Deco hotel that reflected the glamour of the 30s and 40s New York - old school glamour. In this respect, the hotel largely fulfilled all my expectations as the hotel lobby is nice and impressive with low of Art Deco features. I opted for a slightly upgraded room so I would be on a higher floor with a better view. The room was a little small but to be expected in NYC and had some more Art Deco touches that appealed to me a lot. However, I found the service to be impersonal and mistrustful with rather spoiled the experience - the staff seemed to be on the defensive all the time as if the guests were potential thieves who should be monitored. They did not engage in any;4
We were on a girls trip and there were 4 of us - small room for sure but we managed just fine!! We only booked one night but wanted to stay longer but it was sold out. The price of the room was very decent for where it is in NYC and the staff were great! I felt like we stepped back in time in the main lobby and the whole decor of the hotel was awesome. Beds were great, as was the bathroom. There was absolutely no issues and it is definitely somewhere that I will be staying at again!;5
"Our experience of the Wyndham New Yorker was mediocre. The main benefit for us was the location, having a refrigerator in the room, and being able to secure a queen suite. The location afforded us to get around the city very easily, both by walking and subway/train. Our room was a queen suite on the 40th floor with amazing views and good space. Our reservation came with continental breakfast, which was ""one cup of juice, one cup of coffee/tea, and one bagel/croissant/danish."" The quality was poor, and the K-cup coffee in the room was better than in the diner downstairs. We actually chose to eat at small bagel shops around the corner instead of the hotel because of the poor food quality.   The service was unhelpful, sparse, and the amenities were at the level of a motel. The cups";3
The style of the hotel did nothing for me like it did for some other reviewers.  The lobby was nice in a retro way, but the sleeping room was run down and not overly clean.  The location is very convenient, as is having a quick, well-priced, 24-hour diner in the lobby. You can grab a quick bite to eat and be on your way for the rest of the day.    The service is just OK.  We arrived before our room was ready so we checked our luggage with the bell stand.  When we got into our room later in the day, we were trying to relax for a bit so we called the bell desk about 5-6 times over the course of 10-15 minutes.  No one answered. So, I went down to get our luggage, by myself because the person I was traveling with has an injury.  The guy gave me all our luggage and basically walked;3
I don't know how much it costs per night as we stayed there as part of a package holiday but after being disappointed by our hotel in Niagara we sure struck it lucky here . Fantastic location , huge room with external Windows on two sides ,two large comfy double beds , dressing room , massive bathroom with bath and walk in shower need I go on. Loved the art deco decor had some super meals in The Tick Tock diner and we were within walking distance of many of the must see sights plus the subway was around the corner.when I go back to New York I will definitely stay here.;5
We had one of the best hotels stays at the New Yorker. We were given a suite complete with kitchen, sitting room, dinning room, bathroom and bedroom with further settees.  The service was as you always hopeful, first class all complemented by the concierge who arranged all our trips taxis and tours, thanks John.  Fantastic period decor in this 30's art deco building.  Highly recommended.   Just opposite Penn station and close to Macy's and the Empire State Building.;5
Two nights spent in this hotel, great location with no shortage of places to eat/drink within walking distance. Staff very friendly and hotel very secure with security requiring you to show your key before you can approach elevators. Great room with excellent view of Empire State Building & Madison Square Garden. Second time staying in this hotel and definitely won't be the last. Highly recommend!;5
The rooms are truly small but since you don't spend a lot of time at the hotel while in NY, that is not a problem.  Not all of the rooms have good views but if you are lucky to get a good view, it is bonus.  Hotel is a good value compared to most hotels in NYC.  It is close to Penn Station and you can walk to a lot of must see places.;3
After reading some reviews we were a bit sceptical. No need the hotel was brilliant we were given  a rm upgrade on 33rd floor room was more  than adequate. It was cleaned  every day  by house keeping and supplied with fresh fluffy  white towels.  There is also  an iron and ironing  board and hairdrier supplied in the  room together  with a free digital  safe.  We visited the Tick  Tock Diner attached to the hotel  the food was lovely also  Traitoria  Bianca other side  of reception. The hotel  is in an ideal situation across the road is Madison  Square Gardens and Penn Station. The subway  is next to the hotel and its a very  busy area with shops  bars etc.  (Lucy's  Rooftop Bar and Local  West bar were really great with great food. Would  definitely stay here if we ever return;5
Nice room on 20th floor. Room was clean,small bathroom but big enough for one week and also clean. Crew was nice and helpfull. Also very good check at the elevators if everyone was a guest of the hotel.;4
Great location, close to Penn station, Macy's and many more. For Art Deco lovers. Bathrooms not too large, old style, but charming. Perfect of you want to visit New-York, and you might have a great  view on the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building.;5
Perfect location.  Close to everything.  Food, shops, shows, underground railway.  Walking distance to Empire State and Fifth Avenue.  MacDonalds and Starbucks just across the road. The room was very small, but adequate for what we needed - a place to sleep.  Nice shower and bath.  Air-conditioning worked well which was appreciated due to the very hot weather. We were able to check our bags in early and collect them after our checkout - great service. Would definitely go back.;5
Only at the hotel for one night  Busy lobby , Art Deco styling , lots of security  Check in did not take too long ,professional staff . Once my room key was issued I made my way to the elevator area where you must show your key card  There are plenty of elevators so the wait is not too long  Although the hotel has plenty of character some parts /areas look old and worn  My room was on the 26th floor and what I would describe as NYC size  Room was clean fairly well equipped , regardless of how high your room is and regardless of hotel location noise will always be an issue , I still managed to sleep  well . Great location good transport links plenty of stores restaurants nearby , Madison square garden just round the corner  Typical large busy New York hotel;3
"Right across Madison Square Garden & Penn Station.  Very accessible especially if you plan to use the train/subway service.  Rooms are very secure - guests are required to present room key to access the room elevators.  Numerous elevators - you do not have to wait. Very quiet & clean rooms - great housekeeping service.  We stayed for 7 nights.  There is a required ""facility fee"" of USA$27 per night.  For the use of the Wi-Fi, Gym, etc.";4
We arrived to The New Yorker during the afternoon and got our room quickly and easily. At the reception we were served by Mohammed who was very helpful and friendly and we got all the info about the hotel, our room and the services that are available for guests (after checking in I didn't have to ask for any help about anything, because Mohammed explained everything to us so clearly and politely when I rechecked something, 10/10 reception service).  The room was really spacious and clean and it had really nice view towards the South end of Manhattan. Our room was located on the higher floors and it was really silent when compared to the street level noise. The room was renovated not that long ago, bed was new and really comfortable and the furniture and fridge were all in in;5
We stayed here for 5 nights, 1st sept to 6th sept, room clean & comfy beds. We were up on the 33rd floor, very quiet and great views of the Empire State Building. Nice staff and helpful, great location as Near subways, shops inc Macy's, restaurants and bars. Would stay here again 😀;5
The Wyndham New Yorker is in the center of New York city, it is a clean Hotel with spacious rooms, 24 hour Key check security, Elegant Lobby and friendly staff.  We stayed for 4 nights got a great deal on a high floor room.  Our future stay will always be at the New Yorker  In New York city.;5
I loved the old style ambience and decor. Very quiet - never heard other guests or other people's plumbing - just street noises from our corner room. The staff was especially warm and welcoming - not what we Midwesterners expected in New York! Views are hit or miss - you need to ask for a room with a view. I believe they're still in the process of renovating - my bed was rather saggy, but I prefer a firm mattress. The hotel was very clean, centrally located with easy access to subways and easy walking to many sites - e.g., Empire State Bldg, Madison Square Garden.;5
Great room, location and staff.  Will stay here now every time I come to New York!! Handy for subway as station next to hotel. Tick tock cafe was great. Walking distance to Empire State Building Times Square Macy's Grand Central station and Central Park. Direct subway to JFK Brooklyn bridge and World Trade centre Awesome hotel!!;5
Me and my wife with our son and daughter aged 15 and 16 stayed in this hotel for 8 nights. The room was a good size room for a family. Just the bathroom was a bit old if not everything else is excellent. The location itself was great just 15 minutes walk to Time square and all the shopping are just very close to the hotel . Empire State Building was very close just a few minutes walk. The underground Train station is just down the corner. The location was just fantastic. The hotel staffs are very Welcoming which is an extra. One can just stay in this hotel for its location and for an excellent customer service . A very Good hotel for a family. There was security always making sure that only the guest enters the hotel room. Overall the staffs and the location of the hotel made;4
The hotel itself is in a great location.  Very easy to get to the subway and go anywhere in the city.  If you're staying in NYC for more than 4 days, I'd recommend buying the $30 subway pass for unlimited rides.  The hotel's location is pretty hard to beat, though, even if you are just looking to walk around.  You can walk to many attractions without using the subway.  I've been to NYC 5 times, and stayed in various hotels.  Although the rooms in NYC hotels are usually pretty small, this hotel had the smallest room I've ever been in.  My wife and I stayed in the metro queen bed room.  There was very little room to put both of our bags and be able to walk around the room comfortably.  The room was so small that it had a couple of electrical outlets that we could access.  We made;4
I stayed here during a recent business trip to New York City. The hotel is located in a great location. It is right next to Madison Square Garden and the Empire State Building is located nearby. The hotel lobby was well laid out and you had to present your room key to security before you could get to the elevators. The elevators ran quickly and there was very little wait time on them. My room was good enough for my four night stay. The bathroom in my room could use a little updating. Overall it was a very good stay.;4
Stayed for the 3rd time this year. The hotel has no pretentions to be a grand hotel but for location,room quality and price is unbeatable in central manhatton.The adjacent ticktock diner provides in my opinion the best value breakfast in manhatton;4
The front desk people are very rude and unaccommodating.  I booked a queen size bed and they gave me a full size one instead.  The room was very tiny and the bathroom looked like it hasn't ever been updated.  Adjusting the water to a normal luke warm temperature was a 20 minute ordeal.  It did not work properly!!!! The only great thing about this hotel is it's location.  It's right next to Penn Station and Time Square.;2
Conveniently located near Penn Station, I will definitely stay here again. The decor was cool and it fit with the history of the building. I enjoyed the sense of security by having to show my room key before boarding the elevator.;5
tired and shabby.  Staff on reception were pleasant and the cleaner was pleasant.  Thats about it.  Bathroom in big need of a refit.   The sort of hotel you don't want to walk around in bare feet. Half the things in the room don't work.  Lamp doesnt work, we can't turn the aircon down or off, the phone doesnt work - which is a shame as we are paying a supplement for international calls!;1
From the moment you walk in it feels really spacial. Booked a quad room. very large wet room style shower. Only downside is new york traffic seem to think hitting there horns will help some how. Seem to die down after 10. And one night people next to us came back about 1.30 and decided to laugh and chat for an hour, stereo typical loud american. But it was a only one night. The two niggle above are ref being in New york the hotel was brilliant great location. Train ride straight from Airport (Airport train then local train) I think it was about $15 ea and about 40 min. Train stops at Madison Garden which is 3 min walk across the road. Across the road a diner caller roaster, did toast coffee and bacon sandwich. Nice easy breakfast. Used the metro card to get around $2,75 each;4
After a long and tiring train journey we were welcomed by A professional courteous and smiling receptionist called Krystal.  She went out of her way to accommodate us.  She is an excellent advocate for this hotel.  The hotel is very central has all required facilities and we particularly enjoyed tick tick restaurant for breakfast.  Excellent stay at friendly hotel  Art Deco style;5
The Hotel is very well located. It is close to Madison Square Garden and Pen Station with access to the subway system. The Hotel is huge with around 560 bedrooms. Our room for 3 people was small and the beds were also quite small. The bathroom was in need of an update and had leaky taps and shower. The TV/on demand system didn't work properly but the rooms were clean. The air-con was very efficient. Security is good. Everyone entering the lift area has to show their room key. There is a bag storage area available. It costs us $20 to store our bags on the day of departure. We had breakfast in the Tick Tock 24 hr restaurant which adjoins the hotel. The food and service there was first class.;3
We spent five nights at the New Yorker. This was our first visit to NY and the hotel made our trip perfect with its great location near, well almost everything! The hotel itself was beautiful and the staff very helpful. Train station and subway are next to the hotel making it easy to move around. Lots of restaurants and cafes nearby and also pharmacies to get some late night snacks to your room.  We had breakfast at one of the property restaurants and oh my what a treat! A good selection of dishes, diner style. The gym was also extensive so you can easily do your your fitness routine there. They also had a business center where you could print out  tickets to shows etc. for free.  So many pros and only one con.. The shower was awful. No pressure and if someone showers or flushes;4
Beautiful lobby, great elevators and great location. Unfortunately I was on a floor with loud people who left their doors wide open until late at night. I got the impression that they live there. Bedroom was okay, but bathroom was circa 1962. Lots of grout missing and cracked tiles on walls. Not sure if Tick Tock diner is owned by hotel, but the people were not friendly or helpful. Customers were complaining.;3
Located in Mid town. perfect for MSG, Penn Station, Empire State, Macy's etc. An art deco hotel that is looking shabby in places. Check in friendly and efficient, room tiny but clean and comfortable. Very very busy whilst we were there but staff coped well and were always charming. Stayed for five nights and perfectly suited our needs, bed comfy and shower one of best I've ever used.  Down side, the 29 dollar per night facilities fee is a rip off, no coffee maker in room. Room needed a makeover, traffic noise even on 24th floor can keep you awake.;4
Very convenient to Penn Station for trains. Nice hotel,however rooms are small and a few bathrooms could use updating. The tick toc was a good place to eat breakfast. If your looking for place to stay consider this hotel, staff are very pleasant.;4
Only for this hotel is in a great location it has nothing going for it!!! It had the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in!!!! I was so disappointed. When you walk in to the hotel the lobby is beautiful however that is not carried up to the rooms. To make things worse when we were checking out we were handed a bill despite our trip being paid in full in advance. The receptionist argued with me about it for 15 mins even though I gave him the booking voucher that I had received from our travel agent. I then spent 10 mins waiting to speak to a manager only to be told that they didn't have time to speak to me and that they'd 'clear' the bill. I was so cross! We stayed in 9 hotels during our trip and I never encountered rudeness like it, it really put a dampener on our trip.;2
Fantastic example of a beautiful period property, great staff and fantastic location. Gym is extensive and two good restaurants.  Staff are very helpful and pleasant, rooms are very clean and the a/c works great - essential when you visit NY on the hottest weekend of the year!;4
"I spent 2 days in the New Yorker to celebrate my 30th wedding anniversary. We loved the history of the hotel (there's a ""museum"" downstairs). The room was very clean and cool, and obviously you're right in the middle of NYC, so there's plenty to do and eat. The staff at the hotel was exceptional and eager to please, and everything was efficient.";5
Very old,very rude staff..they must do a rennovation..old bathroom and very very small as the room! The staff was very unhelpfull, only 1 , 2 person was good..we needed to print some tickets and they didn't help us..they said that all printers are not working(????). Unfortunatelly new york was our last destination and this hotel was very dissappointed!!;1
This hotel is great if you are coming in to penn station because it is so close.  The tick tock restaurant is very good.  I feel very safe and the staff is very helpful.  The beds are very  nice;5
NEW YORKER HOTEL IS GOOD FOR TRAVELERS WHO ARE SEARCHING FAST AND PLEASURE ATENTION.  Great location.      Great security staff.  If you are traveling from Latin American countries and you feel confortable speaking spanish this hotel is the right place.;5
"Stayed here this time last year, I know strictly you're not meant to give reviews that far back but this should be an exception as I'd really like to get the word out! Not one flaw with our stay; comfort, facilities, view, super-friendly staff, prime location. The two restaurants available at the hotel were also top class - amazing food and service. This was the icing on top of the cake for my dream trip to New York City. Would be back to this hotel in a heartbeat.";5
Stayed here on our way to a family vacation. Close to Madison Square Garden/Penn Station. Cvs conveniently located across the street. Staff were courteous and we checked in/out quickly. Room was a little small, but ok for a single night. Bed was very comfortable. Definitely recommend due to location if for no other reason.;4
I was put on the floor with a family of 7 that was split between two rooms on opposites sides of the hallway. I know this because I heard every word on their conversation that they held in the hallways. They would talk and talk and talk and talk and yell and talk until 1am, then I'd hear them again at 5am. It sounds like I was sharing a wall with the parents and the children were coming over to talk to them every 10 minutes. Not great for a business trip that I had to be at work at 8am every morning. I don't know what else could have been done- I ended up calling the front office when the talking didn't stop until 2am. It's just not great to be on a business trip and share a room with a very needy family.    Actually- I think a white noise machine would've helped a lot.   Also-;4
This is an older property, that shows it's age here and there. Great staff who will help you any way they can.;4
After the first night we asked for a new room to give us views, very helpful and got a great room. great views nice room - bed a little small but we are used to a king size at home . on suite-bathroom was bice decent shower pressure, wardrobe was a good size somewhere to hide the suitcases which increased room size. Flat screen TV was good and an alarm clock but it was the views and the central location that made it stand out for us. We found tick-tock restaurant too expensive and a particular waitress was just rude (other were fine) we eat round the corner (100 metres away) for a much fresher and better value breakfast.;4
"We recently got back from 4 nights at the New Yorker. Typical NY hotel with small rooms but perfectly apt for a holiday where you spend little time in the accommodation! The bed was comfortable and the room had all the amenities you need. Our shower was absolutely useless but we didn't speak to the staff about it so that's our fault. Everyone was incredibly friendly so I'm sure they would have done something to rectify it.   The ""museum"" at the bottom of the hotel is worth popping down to if you have a spare 20 minutes. Amazing to see the history of the place.  The location is good for Times Square, Empire State, Madison Square Garden, Macy's - all central locations.   Tick Tock the diner attached to the hotel is also worth a visit. Cracking waffle breakfast :)";4
we were staying in this hotel for 4 days during our visit to NY, exellent location, walking distance to the most  tourist places like, Times Square, Empire State, wax Musel and more.Rooms are clean, very quiet during the night and we highly recommend this place.;5
stayed here with family to celebrate my 50th after possibly the scariest journey from the airport it was nice to be greeted by the doorman and helped into the building went straight to the reception lady and checked in very quick and easy when finding out why we were there we were upgraded to a better room with view as were parents who were with us ,many many thanks to Jessica who not only gave us a room with a view she also supplied a bottle of bubbly on my birthday with a card, very nice touch and goes a long way to show customer service was outstanding,the view was the empire state building magic waking up to that and going to bed looking at that.  please do not go here with the assumption this is a modern hotel it was built before the empire state but do not underestimate;5
This wasn't my first time in New York but it was my first time tackling the city on my own. No tour guide, no family guides. Just me and friend taking public transit everywhere. We went to see a game at the MetLife and took a bus from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. It was about a 7 minute walk. The Empire State Building was about a mile up the street. Penn Station and the Madison Square Garden was literally across the street. As was Time Square. When you first walk into the hotel the lobby is quite grand. Check in was pretty quick. We weren't offered a bell hop though, which I suppose was okay because we didn't have too many bags, but still, I think for the price of this hotel, it should have been offered. We proceeded upstairs which, by the way, there are different elevators;5
First and for most, BEST customer service! This was our first trip to New York City, and never visited the New Yorker Hotel by Wyndham. As soon as we walked through the door one of the bell man greeted us with a huge smile! Second we were in line and Onelia checked us in. She was AMAZING! I loved how she checked us in with ease, and gave us recommendations on where to eat (Dallas BBQ). The more we talked to her, the more we fell in love with our stay and our experience here at the New Yorker Hotel. Also Onelia went above and beyond for us, and made sure we felt as if we were home. Its rare to find fantastic people who love their job, and give you 100% customer satisfaction, but Onelia did just that and more! I highly recommend this hotel because its very accommodating,;5
The hotel is under renovations on the outside.  Inside the once elegant premier hotel is understated elegance and is a bit dated in places.  It is clean and worth the walk from time square.  The staff are helpfull.;4
This hotel was not as expensive at others so I was a little apprehensive about the quality of the hotel. My fears were quickly laid to rest. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the location is awesome, within walking distance of most attractions in Midtown Manhattan and the rooms were very clean with a nice decor about the whole hotel. They have two restaurants connected to both sides of the hotel with decent food and a bar. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit Manhattan and the Times Square/Broadway area.;4
I know your building is about 100 years old, but do your rooms need to look like they have never been renovated all that time???  The pros:  Amazing location Historic building  The cons: Tiny rooms Rooms are extremely outdated Rooms are extremely worn out Employees at the front desk are not pleasant  Bathroom is extremely worn out, broke floor, tub looks rusty a little not comfortable for showering.;2
Amazing hotel staff exceptional loved my stay sad to leave room was amazing staff were wonderful very friendly service above and beyond would go back as felt very comfortable beautiful hotel a must to stay central to everything;5
"The New Yorker is old and that you see but what I find important; it is clean! Every day your room get cleaned very well. The people who work here are very friendly and helpfull. Rooms are not that big, but that is normal in NYC. Enough elevators and subway nearby.";4
We enjoyed staying at the New Yorker. They are in the middle of renovating   We were lucky to get a new room. It was quite small especially the bed ( it was supposed to be a queen but I think it was more like a full ). They need shelves in the shower and bathroom for shaving kits.   It us close to Madison Square Gardens and Oenn Station which has trains and the subway.;4
"Large impersonal hotel. Only booked because of the location near a flat and I thought that it had been modernised. I am sure they did loads but rooms are really quite small as is the bathroom. The decor is Art Deco, some nice items. Service requests are dealt with very quickly. Areas in the bathroom show age and neglect and corner dirt. Good shower and very good mattresses. Staff I guess under pressure from the volume of trade. Can be on the sharp side. I guess they get lots of requests. The one real grip is the hotel extra tax on arrival. Supposedly for wifi, pool and unlimited calls. It should be in the price as its ""compulsory "".  They fool you with a lower advertised headline price. Not good business but then difficult to argue when  the hotel was full. I won't return and";3
All staff were pleasant and helpful. I had reserved a room with two beds. At check-in, we were told it was a room with one bed and a pull out. I wasn't happy about that. Yet, when we went to the room it did have two beds! I was very happy about that. Weird that their computer wasn't telling them the right thing. The room was clean and spacious.;4
We stayed in a suite on the 30th floor. The rooms were very large which had a small kitchenette which was handy. Very clean and tidy. The only thing they sold us when booking in was WiFi on a daily charge but we then found out that you could free daily usage anyway. We didn't incure any other charges. Thye supplied bottles of water, tea and coffee daily which was great. We ate out every day so can't comment on food at the hotel.;4
We stayed here during a four night stay in august.the hotel is in a great location a stones throw from madison square gardens .we booked with thomas cook who in turn us expedia . The hotel is very art decor 1920 s look and the lobby is very stylish . Checkin was very efficent although was told i had to pay $25 a day for premium wifi , fitness centre which i was never going to use and also business centre again no use . They told me this was mandatory.we were on the 36 floor with a view over the river which was good . The rooms are small but have plenty of cupboard space but lack easy accessable plugs if you are using travel adaptors. The room itself needs a bit of a spruce up which could be done without spoiling the hotel charm.thebathroom was old in its look but it worked as;4
Upgraded our room for a modest fee the night before we travelled as we were only staying one night so we thought, why not?  When we arrived, we'd been put in an enormous suite.  With a view of the Empire State Building!    The New Yorker is right in the heart of a really busy part of the city so, if you're looking for a relaxing break, this might not be the place for you.  It is, however, handy for so many attractions and for catching the Amtrak at Penn Station.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  I've seen comments about the hotel being a bit of a faded glory.  I can only comment on our room and the public areas and they were lovely.  There's ongoing renovation work as well, so presumably all areas will be spruced up.;4
Beautiful hotel, centrally placed for the subway and tourist attractions. Our room was great and easily large enough for 4 people. We didn't eat in the diner but it seem busy each night. Would happily recommend to anyone.;5
The New Yorker hotel is located just across the Penn Station and close to many major attractions. The hotel is however outdated and in need of urgent decoration and renovation. The staff is somewhat casual but helpful,  However  if you would like to have an experience of the past and to feel how hotels were, this ls the place to come.;3
The hotel was in a great location close to many restaurants and stores. The staff were very friendly and the rooms were very clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York.;5
excellent service and hospitality and friendly staff clean rooms . and great view of the empire state building valet parking was great and charges  were reduced for  excellent wifi and close  to everything by  walking;5
We visited the New Yorker from the 27th Aug - 1st sept. It was a family holiday myself my husband, and 2 children aged 12 & 14.  Firstly check in was speedy and the front desk staff were very friendly, we had a free upgrade to a metro view room which was on the 36th floor. The room was clean but quite small....however this we could live with as the view was fantastic, lying in bed all you could see was the Empire State Building please see pics. The location was perfect, across the road from Madison square gardens, 5 minute walk to the Empire State Building, and 10minutes from time square, with shops all round you.  The hotel does not have a restaurant but it has diner attached to it tick tock diner, but I thought the staff were quite rude (except for one of the waitresses) good;4
Arrived at hotel during the rush hour. The staff were quick to check me in. Quickly enrolled me on the Wyndham rewards membership. The hotels had character , and the historical room made it plus. The room was clean and the housekeeper keen to help.;5
Rooms are tiny, key card system is a work in progress (Could not get into my room 2 nights in a row) Front desk seemed like they needed more training. The night manager was helpful  Shower sprayed more out the top then on me. Walls are thin. Heard room next to me with family. Annoying.;3
The only thing that bothered me about this hotel was that they wanted a sort of deposit for the room, even though we had already paid over £1000 each to come to New York, so we didn't actually have any money to give them. They wanted to take cash off of us and give us it back on the last day? I had hardly any spending money and so, could see no point in giving them it to be skint for the holiday and have loads of useless dollars on the last day. This therefore meant we couldn't use the phone in the hotel room and stuff like that. I honestly thought they were going to fling us out because we had no money to give them but they let us stay.  The hotel was absolutely beautiful, I have never been anywhere like it before. It had a diner attached as well which made it even better - the;4
Your hotel is located in a very nice area. This was are first trip to NY, we didn't know what to expect, are room was good the desk clerk was friendly, the elevator clerks that ck u room cards were nice.;5
Amazing hotel and location.  Would recommend this hotel - BUT!!!  The only issue we had and I am still trying to resolve is...We checked out our room yesterday and paid cash for the service charge for 3 nights which they gave me a receipt for.  When we arrived my bank card details were taken as a 'hold' I was told. They said no money would be taken from my card it was just a hold in case of damage and non payment of service charge.. I paid cash for service charge when we checked out and double checked that no cash was to be taken form my account - which they replied no but there is still a pending transaction on my account from them. No money should be taken from my account as all monies have been paid. I now have no access to this money until they release the pending against;4
The stay was all that we expected.  Nice location in city, the hotel was very thorough on security and the stay was great.  We got good recommendations from the help desk on restaurants and things to see and do.;5
I would definitely chose to stay at the Wyndham New Yorker again & also recommend to family & friends.  The room & bathroom was nicely updated.  The hallways were nice & quiet.  I felt secure staying at the Wyndham New Yorker.  The location was great with access to plenty of shopping.;5
The New Yorker is in a great location, right next to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, 2 blocks from Macy's and a 5min walk to Times Square and Theatre District.   The staff are very friendly, you need to show hotel room swipe to get up to rooms. The rooms are very big in size and very clean. Beds are very comfortable.   We were on the 35th Floor, view was great and couldn't hear the traffic from street.   Heaps of towels. I wish the rooms had a bar fridge in them.   Next time I am back in New York will stay here.;4
We had a great time! Loved the classy deco decor, the views, and the comfy beds. We had a suite on the 40th floor. Treat yourself!  The details are also so nice: thick towels, nice shampoo, soft drinks in the fridge, good coffee and bottled water.;5
Stayed at The New Yorker with the family for one week. Hotel was well located, rooms were clean and any issues were promptly sorted by reception. Agree the bathrooms are a dated and rooms on the small side, but overall very happy.;4
Perfect location, able to  walk to many things. Staff was friendly and helpful. Don't expect to have a large room, but everything you need. Housekeeping was great! Norma was so sweet.;5
We love visiting New York City and the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel was recommended to us by a friend. We stayed there during our 10 night holiday last year and were so happy with our overall experience that we booked to stay there again for 12 nights this summer! The location is excellent, conveniently located opposite the hub of Penn Street station and within easy walking distance of the 34th Street subway stations which offer links to Manhattan and beyond. Not only that, within yards of walking out of the main entrance, you are greeted by the famous Madison Square Gardens venue and the truly iconic Empire State Building - just a ten minute walk away. Located on 34th Street, the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel is on the doorstep of Macy's and Herald Square and just a 30 minute stroll;5
We spent 3 nights in this hotel. The location is great, because you are near to the interesting sights. We asked for a room in a higher floor and we have got one with an amazing view. Unfortunately the windows were dirty because of works going on on top of the hotel. I tried to clean them, but it was difficult, because you only could open the windows about 15 cm (about 6 inches). The room 3715 was very quiet. WIFI worked well in the room as well as in the lobby. I can highly recommend this hotel.;5
We booked here last minute after a very disappointing hotel around the corner. Friendly helpful staff, spotlessly clean rooms, loved the decor, we booked 2 rooms both with amazing views. Can't recommend this place enough.;5
The room and bathroom was clean. The only thing is that the bathroom times around the tub needed new caulking.;3
The hotel met all of our expectations plus!  Clean, courteous etc!  John, the head of transportation sure knows how to take care of the hotel guests.  Security was also excellent !  Highly recommend this hotel!;1
This is my third stay here. It is located close to FIT College Kaufman Hall dorms. The staff is amazing in the hotel and the two restaurants - the Tick Tock Diner and Trattoria Blanca. The rooms are very small.  Don't pay for a view room - haven't gotten a good view yet. Rooms are very clean. Some bathrooms are not updated and it is hard to regulate the water temp (be careful with kids showering - can get very hot). Housekeeping are great - they always say hello and ask how your day is going. It is located kitty corner to Penn Station and a great place - Lucy's. Can't say enough about the staff. So very nice. If you can handle a small room - this is a great hotel. If you go to Trattoria Blanca sit in Patagiota's section, she is awesome. She recognized my daughter and I from our;4
I stayed here for three nights over a weekend in June. The hotel is perfectly nice but the rooms are tiny, in need of renovating, and sound travels too much.  ROOM I was surprised on asking for a good room and offering to pay more to walk into a tiny room reminiscent of the 70s. After having read the website about flatscreen TVs a horrid little television was in the room. There would be no connecting the HDMI cable to watch movies that night. The room had a small safe, vertical style, that managed to fit my laptop and other valuables, inside a tiny wardrobe. The room also had a small desk to work at, and ironing board. The bed and bedding was comfortable enough, thankfully I planned on spending very little time in the room.  SLEEP I had a room relatively high up (I suppose;3
I return to The New Yorker time and time again when I stay in NYC, which is quite often.  The staff in every department are more than helpful and very pleasant.  Everyone makes you feel welcomed to be there -- from arrival to departure.;5
This was our first time to the big apple. It was amazing. The hotel was great. It's location in Manhattan was perfect. The only bad thing was the room was very small but not for NY. But had what we needed. So unless you can upgrade to a little bigger room be prepared. Everything else was fantastic. The two restaurants had great food.;5
A lovely hotel in the heart of the city. Friendly staff, in particular Mohammed, who up graded our room. The room was smaller than others we have stayed in on USA trips but was adequate for our needs. No tea and coffee facilities in the room was a little disappointing.  Would recommend for location and hospitality.;5
I wanted to take the time to thank you and your staff for a beautiful stay in your hotel. My boyfriend and I were only there one night for his birthday weekend but we now intend to stay there every chance we get. We were checked in by chance by one of the Member Services/Check In employee. She started our trip off with laughter and ease, getting us into room as quickly as possible in order to let us have more time to enjoy the city. I signed up to become a member instantly because of her! ONELIA, I'm so sorry if that's spelled wrong, she's a game changer and helped us to have a true weekend away. Thank you so much and please thank her again for us because her doing her job with joy allowed us to experience joy in that hotel and in the city.;5
Me, my husband and 3 children (10-16) came to New York for the first time and the hotel was the ideal place to stay for it.  The location was great, places near by (McDonald's and Starbucks) to get a quick breakfast as we left, and plenty of places to eat on a night.  Being a short walk away from Time Square and so close to Pen Station was great for us as it meant we could just hop on transport to get to other places, but also had a nice walk to lots of other attractions. The hotel it's self had helpful staff and we always felt safe as to get to lifts you had to prove you were staying there. The rooms were fine for the amount of time we spent there as we were out the majority of the time, but if we'd have spent longer there would have probably found it a bit small. The room was;4
"Location is great, customer service so-so, lots of extra charges - in addition to the $25-ish dollar per day ""facility charge"" and local taxes, the hotel charges $2 per item for left luggage - not at all clear what the facility fee is actually for! Would I stay again? - yes - but purely for the location, and in spite of the pretty average facilities and staff. Watch out for elderly electronic door locks too - we had to be moved to a different room at 10pm when our door lock stopped working, not what you want at the end of a tiring day. However, were given a complimentary breakfast as an apology for the inconvenience.";3
The hotel is convenient to all of NY city it is small and very well taken care of  the rooms are small but very comfortable the beds are very nice the only negative thing I can say s they need to put coffee makers in the rooms so you dont have to get up and dressed to get your first cup of coffee or tea in my case my husband coffee. I will stay again and I will recommend it to others.;5
First impressions: We could barely fit our 3 cases in our first room and open the door, the room is tiny. Can almost touch the window, bathroom door and main door from the bed! A view of another building through the window. And beware if booking online as you may not be aware they add on $29+tax a day resort charge for no real reason.   The bed creaked badly, the pillows were not comfortable. There is no water or tea/coffee making facilities in the room. This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel!   It's Art Deco, so old fashioned and original. if Art Deco is your thing as the lobby is a nice example, as are the fixtures and fittings. Otherwise find somewhere further out and save your money. The previous night was spent at a hotel overlooking the Central Park and this cost half the;3
If you want to stay at a classic, old-time-style hotel, The New Yorker is it!  This place has charm, it has that old-movie feel to it, like maybe Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are about to step out of one of the elevators.  The rooms are pretty small, but very comfortable, the staff is great, and the on-site diner has great food.  Highly recommended.;5
Recommended by several friends, the New Yorker is centrally located and convenient. The room was small for 4 of us but clean and everything worked. The hotel is secure and the staff are careful only to allow guests upstairs.  Would have liked to have gone to the 20th floor to observe the city but it was closed during our visit.;4
A bare basics typical mannhattan hotel. It does the job if you want to avoid paying 270+ . It has serviceable rooms and basic amenities . Great location next to many city attractions . Has a great 24/7 restaurant downstairs with good options menu . Front desk is average as you get the typical hurried reception assembly line . But that is expected for the price in mid Manhattan . This is not a upper tier hotel but if you are traveling with family or on a quick business trip this will do as most of your time will be outside the room and the hotel.;3
Please be advised that this hotel is partially being used as a homeless shelter and therefore the halls an elevators can be shared with dangerous, loud people. In addition to that, the area around Penn Station is the worst in Manhattan as one will clearly see upon arrival. The check in area is a mix of tourists and homeless residents and their shady visitors. We rode the elevator up to our room with homeless people who were barefoot. Another commenter mentioned that it looked like welfare people were staying at the hotel and he/she is correct. A call to the local police station (or a good Google search) can help advise in choosing a better hotel.;1
I was hesitant to make a reservation after reading many not so great reviews. But the price was the best around. Much to my surprise, we loved our stay at the New Yorker! Right from the start, walking into the lobby, very beautiful, an air of yesteryear. Checking in was easy and the hotel receptionist was welcoming and very pleasant. I had asked when making the reservation if it would be possible to upgrade to a view room. They made a note on our reservation and we did get the upgrade! I believe our room was one of the newly renovated ones, and it was lovely! Every employee we encountered was very friendly and hospitable. The location is perfect to access everything. Penn Station right across the street. Walking or subway you can cover all of Manhattan!;5
We stayed in the hotel with 2 adults and 2 teens in a 2 queen size bed room. The first night we had a very small room but were then upgraded to a very comfortable room. The whole service was great. Bathroom was ok but the shower power was too strong and couldn't be regulated well. Unfortunately there was also no fridge in the room. Wifi was free and sometimes a bit slow. Beds and room service were good. We had a car but valet parking in the hotel was too expensive. We found a much cheaper parking garage only 5 min walk away via spothero.com. Breakfast is served in a diner next to the hotel but there are further opportunities around the hotel. The hotel is very central in the City and located next to a subway station. All in all we enjoyed our 5 day stay in the hotel and in NYC;4
We are a family of four from Trivandrum,India but flew from Dubai to the US for holidays. We had the misfortune of staying in this shack for a night. Was the only negative part of an otherwise fun time in Manhattan. The whole place was shady, staff were rude illegals! There was a tiny 2 feet wide corridor to the room. No brerakfast. No wifi. They even charged extra $24 for facilities which we did not ask for. That was compulsory and that was the rules. Was never written before booking. Thankfully I won that dispute with a little help from my Bank.  People stay away from this hotel - you dont need to waste your time there or spend time to write a bad review in TA.;2
"The location of this hotel is great, close to many of the main attractions in Manhattan. First impressions when you enter the lobby are ""Wow"" as the decor is very retro but tastefully done. This is the only wow factor though! The hotel itself is quite old - you can see this from the poor standard of the bathrooms. The tiles look like they've been on the walls since the hotel was built. Grime has built up around the bath & taps and the room just smelt fusty.  Bed was comfy but bedroom was small, dark & pokey. Decor of bedroom questionable as work work has clearly been damaged and dinted over the years and had just been painted over. Very poor finish. Carpets looked dark & dirty and bedding smelt a bit fusty like it hadn't been aired enough.  What annoyed me most was lack of";2
Well, it was our first time in NY, a business trip and we took out kids (infant and 7y.) Not used to this type of buildings... We booked a suite, to our surprise a very tight room, very small bathrooms not modern, more like public restrooms. A friend in another room saw a rat in his room. Not the best place... Small lobby. It has a nice burgers restaurant we went. The building has its history and a small museum. The place is noisy but I guess its the city... The thing we most liked was the view, the Empire State right in front!;2
I had a obnoxious, check in clerk, Mohamed, who did not fulfill the reservation as made.  We reserved a 156 sq ft room and got 120 sqft. Thank God for the others in the hotel who made it right.  Everyone else was great, especial Hector the door man.;4
I have stayed in the hotel on July for 4 nights. The hotel has a central location, very big and clean. Staff were good in general. However, being a big hotel it is busy all the time. The receptionists are very busy all the time. The lobby is large and well decorated, but you can barely find a place to sit. The hotel is a little bit expensive and you have to pay for almost anything including storing the luggage for few hours after checking out. The good thing is that there is a security near the elevators which ask for room card before accessing the rooms. My room was spacious on a high floor with an excellent view on the river. The room as well as the toilet were very clean and has almost all needed amenities and toiletries. As for the coffee machine you have to call them to;4
Hotel was well positioned for the Empire State Building. Well looked after and very busy.  Room cards checked by security before access allowed to the lifts. But, we had no choice but to pay the 'facility fee'. This supposedly covered phone calls, gym access and wifi code? At nearly £19 per day per room for something you might not want or use it was way too high.  Treatment at booking in was far from friendly.  Take care booking a taxi from reception - there are cheaper ways to travel!  Don't fleece your guests!;3
We stayed there on two separate occasions in August. First time we were given a room upgrade, which was a nice size the second time we stayed we got a standard room which was a little small. The rooms had coffee machines and the usual accessories. Staff were polite and generally helpful.  The hotel has an art deco theme in the rooms. We were told that rooms had recently been refurbished, not sure I would have guessed without being told.AC was load but very good.  The hotel is well located. Madison Square Gardens is across the road, Time Square is not too far a walk and there is a Subway station right next to the hotel which goes straight to JFK.  There are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants locally and a Hertz car rental round the corner (though I have never been to a less;4
This is an amazing place to stay. Had superb service even before my arrival. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, from the hotel manager to the reservations ladies! A special word of thank you must be made of Gabina, who treated us like we were her own family! Thank you to the lovely people made our stay here memorable.;5
"I got a last-minute deal on a room for a little more than $100/night.  Though Ex_____ usually is all inclusive when prepaid, I got hit with a service fee of around $30 at the hotel,   It was still a bargain and well worth.  The lobby is clean, spacious and well secured.  The elevators are numerous and fast enough,   The hallway design offers secluded nooks away from elevator noise.  Rooms are reasonably well appointed, clean, quiet and comfortable.  The location is hard to beat.  The hotel recommends the Icon parking at One Penn Center, but I wasted an hour in mid-day traffic trying to enter, and the dimwit ""Traffic Police"" who degrade the NYPD by wearing their logo are unmotivated and worthless ""helpers.""  Instead, I recommend parking at the Port Authority Bus Termina, which is";5
Stayed here as we were attending concerts at Madison Square Garden.. This venue is across the road as well as Penn Station.. It's a bit of a walk up to Times Square and Central Park but it's New York so loads of places to see. The hotel staff were excellent - early check in which was great, diner located next door which is open 24/7, the room was on a high floor with a corner view. Will definitely be back..;5
Stayed here 26th July -1st Aug. First visit to new york chose this hotel because of its location. Staff very helpful and friendly even gave us a larger room as we had a lot of luggage headed to mexico for second part of holiday. Shame about the service charges especially if you don't use the gym or business centre, not something we would do on a family holiday!! Our girls loved the Tick Rock dinner in lobby of hotel, huge portions! Overall a great hotel with lots of history and great character, I hope it stays this way. We will be back.;4
Room superb with fantastic view of The Empire State Building!  Top security and very friendly staff! Good air conditioning thank goodness as temperatures went into the 90's! Tick tick diner good food!  We stayed for a week and found the hotel was in a very good location.;5
My hubby took me to NY early August, wow it was hot!  Stayed at Wyndham New Yorker. lovely Art Deco very clean/tidy and lovely staff!  Quite small rooms, we were on floor 26 and the view was of the opposite building - but let's be honest!/ how long are you in your room while in NY???  All in all it was lovely!  Staff were all very friendly and helpful;4
"I was only here for one night however; the front desk staff was fast and friendly. The room that we were in was very small and in a corner hallway and no other rooms around so it was a little creepy at first and very loud elevators. The hotel has so much history and love how close it is to Empire and Time Square. We would stay here again if ever in NYC";4
Travelled some years ago in the month of January, Well situated within walking distance of Times Square, Macey's, Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden.  Room was on the small size but adequate, staff friendly and polite with nice coffee shop in the foyer.;4
I stayed at The New Yorker Hotel in the month of August in 2016.  I had a standard room - which was as advertised, nothing special, no mini fridge.  The room had a comfortable bed, a tv and the bathroom was well equipped with a hair dryer.   The staff were polite and courteous and even gave me a room with a slight view of the Empire State Building which was a nice touch.   That brings me to the best feature of this hotel, the location. Everything important was walking distance away. There are also some very good dining location in close proximity to the hotel.   Overall I enjoyed my stay at The New Yorker Hotel and would stay there again in the future.   Alex;4
The best thing I can say about this hotel is really only the location. It was near just about everything.  The bathroom was extremely small for the price we paid. When you exited the elevators you were greeted with a combination of old smoke and pickle juice smells. Did not spend a lot of time in our room.;3
Really enjoyed our stay at the New Yorker, I've visited many hotels before but this one has been the cleanest of all. Also the staff was really helpful since we got there, I have no complaints about this hotel or my stay.;5
This is a dated hotel but they are trying very hard to maintain the quality. Location is the greatest advantage as it is near the Penn station and walking distance to Macy, Times Square and Empire State. The Gym is well stocked with machines and weights (I liked that). The housekeeping staff is good and do clean up every day. There is a restaurant in the hotel and it is pricey.;4
The Wyndham is located a few blocks from Time Square and just a block away from Penn Station. We came by train so this was very convenient however this convenience came with a cost. It's New York City, so the hustle and bustle was expected but the many homeless sleeping on the sidewalk was a little more than disconcerting. The hotel itself is dated and could use a new paint job. Our room was very small. There were only two of us but the room felt cramped and the toilet is at a child's level. The staff are very friendly and housekeeping is accommodating, however, the room we stayed in had a musty smell and the rug felt clammy on bare feet. The bed and pillows were ridiculously hard and very uncomfortable as were the chairs in the lounge. If I could sum up this review in one word,;3
Great location. Staff fantastic. We had an issue with the safe in our room not working(due to batteries) called down to reception and within 5 minutes a member of the team was fixing it for us.  All staff really friendly and helpful. Hotel room nice size and comfortable, air conditioning was fantastic. Would recommend a stay here and we will return.;5
We had a wonderful time at the New Yorker Hotel.  It was fully enjoyed be the whole family, and we have older children.  Staff and facility at the New Yorker Hotel were very helpful and professional  I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a great hotel in NYC;5
The New Yorker Hotel is beautiful. The lobby is comfortable, the staff is accommodating and helped us with our reservation, finding theater tickets, getting taxi's and finding our way around the city.  Our room was comfortable and beautiful, but very tiny. The queen sized bed took up most of the space, so there was very little room for walking around or storing our luggage. Both restaurants had great food and amazing service. We enjoyed our stay.;4
Book this hotel if you're looking for a good location in Manhattan, it's a close walk from Times Square and Broadway shows... And that's about it. If you book through Expedia be prepared to pay an extra $30 per person per night the moment you arrive as a 'facilities fee', which gives you access to the wifi, business center and gym. You have to pay it even if you're not gonna use any of these. The staff look disinterested and never seem to be wanting to help. I asked for very simple things like getting an extra set of bedsheets (they never arrived to the room), wanted to pick up a package that arrived in the mail (mail room was closed) and wanted a receipt for the $300 I paid for the facility fee (never happened). To finish it up, they charge you $2 per piece for looking after;2
Worst NY Hotel stay ever. I was promised an early check in and a view. For this, I had to upgrade and pay an extra fee each night. Since we didn't get the early check in, and had tickets to a show at 2:45, we had to preregister where we were told that we would automatically get the room we wanted. When we returned at 7:00, there was no view and the room upgrade that we were supposed to get was either not done at all, or the worst ever. The top of the line executive rooms are so small that a dresser won't fit into the room and so there is none, I'm not sure that it wasn't a full instead of a queen sized bed and bathroom is VERY small with no water pressure. When I complained, I was told the manager would return my call and the upgrade fee would be returned. Not only was the fee;1
The Wyndham New Yorker provided a nice stay in the city. Front desk service requires a long wait, especially during peak check in/out times. Staff was friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to a Premium Suite based on Diamond status, which was nice. The room was clean, spacious, and had a nice view. It even featured a private terrace, although you could not get outside.  Hotel location is pretty central with Penn Station across the street, making all of Manhattan a short subway ride away. Overall a nice option for a few days in the city, especially if the price is reasonable.;3
This was our first trip to New York and we chose The New Yorker for it's convenient location. What a good choice it was. It is a lovely hotel keeping lots of it's original 1920 features but being modern at the same time. I would personally like to thank Kristale who gave us the most fantastic room when we got to reception. The view from our room was straight down to the Empire State Building. I had heard stories of New York rooms being small, not so ours which was a very pleasant surprise. There is noise from the streets of New York (whose drivers seem to live honking their horns) but we were so tired from our exciting, fun filled days that we were asleep within moments. The beds were very comfortable too. We felt comfortable knowing that staff checked people for their room key;5
My 17 year old son and I had a nice time at this hotel. It was a bit pricey but everything in NYC is pricey. Great location, nice rooms (tiny bathroom) and a fun diner in the building. It was one of the best deals I could find in this area for a room with 2 beds.;4
A nice hotel in a great location but our room was very small and basic with a very poor outlook which was disappointing. Bathroom needed an update badly. Hotel staff were really helpful and friendly. Free wifi was good.;3
The best thing was the location with a subway entrance on both sides of the hotel.  Only 1 of the concierge staff was much help, but the security staff was helpful.  Both my daughter and I took hot showers right after each other one night after midnight and due to the small size of the room and being an older hotel, we caused the fire alarm to go off.  Although security showed up as soon as we called, the only way to resolve the problem was to turn down the temperature on the thermostat and open the windows as that was the only way the fire alarm would go off., which took a while.  Not a great experience for neighboring guests I am sure.;3
The hotel is in a superb location, so you can get to almost all the key attractions easily.  Most of them are a simple subway ride away, but some of them, like the Empire State, Macy's, Times Square and Rockefeller Center are walkable.  However, our room was very small, the lobby is constantly crowded and the service is not great.  You pay for the location.  OK for a 2-3 night blitz of the sights.;3
We stayed at this hotel last November on a weeks trip to NYC.  The hotel was lovely, with a real vintage feel to the lobby area. The staff were friendly and accommodating, everyone we came across was very polite.   The rooms were not that big but we didn't spend much time in ours what with all the sightseeing so wasn't really much of an issue. The facilities were ok. It was a little noisy but we expected this being in the middle of Manhattan.   There is a 24 hour diner attached to the hotel also which was nice for breakfast or a 2am milkshake :)   All in all not a bad place to stay in an excellent location (literally across the road from Madison Square Garden).;4
The New Yorker is located one block from Penn Station and across the street from the subway! Our room was small but we did not need a spacious room for sleeping--who wants to hang around their room in NYC! The room was clean and tastefully decorated. I appreciated that security is tight.;5
"The New Yorker has a great, central Manhattan location so perfect for a sight seeing holiday.  The hotel is looking rather tired, especially the rooms, with exterior refurbishment underway.  The Tick Tick diner is great and ideal for breakfast - a more traditional USA feel than the standard Starbucks.  Watch out for the $10 per room, per day ""facility fee"" surcharge for WiFi.  Helpful concierge service.";3
felt very disappointed when going in to room,and sick when we saw the bathroom,must be like it was in the 1920's when it was built,shower head not working spitting water at you,toilet and bath very low to floor,bath made out of some sort of moulded plastic very odd,but sink clean beds clean.;2
I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. There was a long line at the check in and the lobby was always very crowded. I requested a renovated room with a view, thank you Mohammed for getting me a really nice room without any extra charges. The room was clean with free water bottles and a great view at the Empire State Building. The hotel does charge a resort fee but you will be able to use the 24hour gym and a business center and free wifi. I think the hotel is a good choice to explore the upper part of Manhatten, although I find it rather pricey.;4
They treated us like royalty from the young lady who check us to whom brought us a bottle opener at 2 am. They gave my wife and I a beautiful newly renovated room very nicely decorated with an awesome view towards the Empire State Building and sent  up a bottle of wine as well. This was our first time in four yrs that we were actually able to enjoy my wife's birthday she wasn't sick no one crashed into her car and no family members were sick. Finally I accomplished my one promise since I met her lol may not seem as much but finally a good birthday anniversary weekend . Very convenient as we also went to a drake concert that was just a walk away from out hotel at Madison square. Thanks to everyone;5
To end our 5 weeks roadtrip through the US, our family of 5 stayed for 4 nights in the New Yorker hotel in a family suite on the 19th floor (room 1931). Obviously this is a big hotel with hundreds of hotel rooms and hence the procedures tend to be a bit industrial, but we found the staff friendly and efficient.   On the upside, we have 2 queens in one room and a convertible sofa in a second one. When converted into a bed, there was hardly any space left and opening the fridge was no longer possible, on the other hand this was not a big issue as we spent most of the day outside exploring the city.  What is a bit deceiving is that on Booking.com, there are pictures of a premium double queen suite showing a small kitchen, and eating table and a small balcony on top of 2 queens and;4
The New Yorker is not only clean, convenient and charming, it is a very affordable hotel.  We loved the art-deco ambiance. We would definitely stay there again. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay when in NYC.;4
We choose this hotel for its proximity to MSG and were NOT disappointed! Had an amazing room with a great view on the 33rd floor  The staff was very accommodating and friendly. Requested more pillows and blankets and received them quickly. Would definitely stay here again!;5
Very good location, groceries & pizza's / coffee very close and very good,Very convenient to get from airport  -- Penn station is just around the corner,10 to15 minutes walking to time square  and to 5th avenue.;4
This is an old hotel with a number of updates over the years.  It is extremely presentable, with helpful staff, clean rooms and reasonable rates.  The rooms can be small, and the hotel is older.  That can contribute to the charm of the stay, this real estate has seen a lot of people come and go over the years.  The location to get to shopping, tourist attractions, transportation and restaurants is so convenient;5
This hotel is in a prime location when visiting New York. Just a couple of blocks from the Empire State Building, Macy's and Times Square. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate and suited our needs as we were rarely in it. The hotel staff were friendly and we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel when checking out to make the most of our last day in the city. Would definitely stay here again.;5
My wife and I visited early august. Great service at the counter by Miguel we got a complimentary upgdrade to the 40th floor to celebrate our anniversary a very nice touch. Great views, great service. Very clean post refurbishment. Central location with easy access to Penn Station. Would definitely recommend and stay again.;5
We enjoyed our stay at The New Yorker.  The location is very convenient.  We arrived early and were able to check in at 10:30.   Rooms were small but expected in NYC. Our room was clean and neat. We will be back!;4
Upon arrival the hotel looks great from the outside, but initial appearances can be deceiving, as you get to the rooms they are tiny, old, outdated, and juts not up to 4-star standards, featuring cheap furniture and fittings, uncomfortable matress, dirty old carpets, and an old bathroom without a door lock! The quality of the room could have been overlooked if we payed the price that was initially given (I payed in advance) aside from the actual hotel price you have to pay for a $29 + tax hotel facility fee per night for services you might not even need and that were represented as included when booking! Very dishonest to force you to pay for something you don't need without any prior advice! We are very unhappy and disappointed, you would be better off paying a cheaper price;2
We were travelling to NYC to see Billy Joel at MSG. We were extremely impressed with the New Yorker Hotel. The staff was phenomenal. The rooms are small, but very cosy. The beds were very comfortable. The Tick Tock Diner has a wide variety of menu options at a very fair price. We drove into NYC, and took advantage of the valet services - very convenient. The property is adjacent to subway lines A, C, and E (we purchased a MetroCard and made full use of the subway to get around town). These subway lines take you to all points in Manhattan, including the World Teade Center, Times Square, the theater district, Rockefeller, and much more. I hope to stay at this property again for my next NYC adventure.;5
The hotel was in the perfect location for exploring NYC. I really loved the service we received when we stayed and would highly recommend it to anyone else who wants to stay at a brilliant place. Beds were very comfortable;5
Very poor service. I reached hotel around 9:30 PM and got my room ready at 11:30 PM. I called them in advance and requested that I have 2 kids and please provide double beds in room but they gave only 1 queen size bed. When requested to provide pull over bed first they gave very small sofa which is even not good for 3 years kids. Had hard time to get extra bed to sleep full family. They charged $63 for 2 nights as service charge and don't have any facility. Only good thing with this hotel is location.;2
Aside from the great location this hotel is people friendly. The staff is helpful in aiding you on where to go, what to see & everything in between. The place is gorgeous too. The rooms are nice size, very comfortable & a great view from the big windows;5
we stayed in a doble bed room. the room was kind of small, but that wasn't a big deal for us.  Bed and pillows were comfortable and service at the front desk was good.  I could not get the Internet to work on my ph;4
I would really love to say when i stayed here in December last year from the 9th to 11th Dec 15 that this was one of the most best and really helpful places ive ever stayed anywhere in the world me and my friend was ment to stay here and when we arrived to check in we found out that our reservation wasnt there so therefore us not having anyware to stay we spoke to manager on shift that night 9th Dec 15 his name was Dell And we also spoke to another manager after Dell had left but im unsure of his name anyway Dell was the most biggest help and most nice gent ive met in a very long time he did everything in his power and more to help me and my pal out he put us up in a spare room he found (which was really hard as it was fully booked with the Xmas period) the room.was just so;5
"Hotel is in a convenient location, next to subway.  However, rooms are extremely small and somewhat outdated.  Sink did not drain and called to have fixed but was not.  Also, no hot water from sink.  My room also was not cleaned for two days and was told that I had put a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door but did not.  I called and filed a complaint with the manager and was told that they had over 1,000 rooms to clean and were doing the best they could.  Lastly, there is no refrigerator in the room and elevators were out of order one day and had to use service elevators that were not air conditioned.   I will seek out another hotel to stay at during my next excursion to NYC.";2
Lobby is just as pictured.  Check in was quick and easy.  Room was tiny.  It was just over 10 feet by a little under 13 feet.  Very small bathroom with one glass shelf as there isn't counter space on pedastel sink.  A little bit of mold was in bathtub soapdish. View from 24th floor on 34th street side was not impressive. Proximity to penn station for subway could not be beat.  You could take exit from subway in the rain and never get wet getting to hotel.  Bed and pillows excellent.  Good water pressure and hot water plentiful.  Safe in closet was nice to secure valuables during day.  Rate was lower than other similar hotels.  I would stay there again, but would like to compare a different hotel if I go back.  Facility fee was only 10.99 a day which was less than I expected;4
Our hotel room was small, clean and just perfect for us! Our view was beautiful, overlooking the Empire State Building and many others. The location was also perfect as we were very close to everything (times square, central park etc) and when we wanted to go further such as The Statue of Liberty, hailing for a taxi outside was easy enough! On top of this the staff were very helpful and friendly, and arranging the airport transport was stress free and simple so we didnt have to worry about it. It was definetely a holiday to remember! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to see New York City!;5
Loved our visit to the New Yorker! Made mistake on reservations. Madeline Marte took care of our issue and made our first trip to NYC a memorable one. Room we had was small but it is the big city, folks. Reminded us of our hotel in London in that regard. Location to Penn station was awesome--basically next door. 34th sub station on nearly every corner. Central location tough to beat! Thanks New Yorker!;4
Hotel is well placed.  Our room was plenty big enough, with two bathrooms. Very pleased that the aircon was efficient without being overly noisy. Despite the complete lack of a view and the Hotel feeling a little dated would probably stay here again as it was very reasonably priced & we didn't spend a great deal of time (awake) in the room;3
LOVED this hotel... Received a free upgrade to a great room with views of the Empire State and MSG ( courtesy of Expedia )... Beautiful historic lobby, period details everywhere.  Our room on the 7th floor had great views, and despite facing 8th Avenue, only a little street noise. Great bed, pillow -top queen, crisp white linens, generous room size for NYC. All the necessary amenities like bedside docking stations, lots of USB and power points, Keurig coffee machine, desk and drawers. Tiny but modern bathroom - double shower and shaving / makeup mirror.  Tip- buy a sectional travel toiletry bag that hangs up as counter space in the bathroom is almost non-existent... Bathroom would benefit from an exhaust fan, but we just left the door open. Powerful air conditioning in the room;5
The location was great - right by Penn Station, a 5 minute walk from Times Square, Empire State Building and even quicker to Macy's!  We had a room with a sofa bed in the lounge area, 2 double beds in the bedroom and 2 bathrooms. We're on a road trip as a family of us and this was by far the smallest room we've had - 3 nights of being on top of each other was enough!  Our one gripe was the carpet was very wet in the room and was still wet the morning after we arrived.   Bathrooms were dated with very little shelving. There was nowhere near enough room for all our toiletries, so everything was scattered round in every available space - we even got the ironing board out to use as another surface!;4
We booked two double beds with a pull out sofa and ended up getting upgraded to a Premier Suite on the 38th Floor! The room was amazing! My husband and I got our own room while our three boys shared an enormous living room space that accommodated two rollaway beds flanking the double pullout sofa! There was also two full bathrooms and a Six seater dining table!  The hotel gave us two complimentary breakfast vouchers for each day and it was a great savings to us. The restaurant was also located in the hotel (Tick Tock Diner) and was very reasonably priced for a breakfast place. Housekeeping were also fantastic providing water and soft drinks in our mini fridge. The only thing missing was walking out onto the balcony but with the view we didn't miss it. We felt like celebrities!;5
Very old hotel which require urgent renovation. Bath taps are terrible. Wi-fi is the slowest on earth. Staff are friendly. Location is central. Room is medium size and convenient. Room is fairly clean.;3
We had a room on the 28th floor with good views across the city. The hotel is old and feels it, decor is largely brown and overall can feel drab but we really enjoyed our stay as its location is good. Minutes from Macy's and Empire State.  Free continental breakfast selection although very limited did the job perfectly and oh my, the views. Probably best in the city without paying! We enjoyed those amazing views each morning and loved it.   I'd recommend as long as you are aware that the general area of 8th Ave is pretty gritty in places and you're ok with dates brown decor and carpets with basic showers ... It is rather charming though given its history!;4
Location location location! Stay in this hotel if you need to be near Penn station or Madison Square Garden, close to Macy's and the Empire State building! This was medium priced with excellent service and very attentive staff! However the rooms are extremely small. The low prices that you will get on;4
It was a weekend stay & only used room to shower, groom & sleep. Bedding is excellent which is top on my list. My sincerest thanks to Hector from Bell Services who helped us from the moment we walked in until we took our taxi to the airport by answering all questions & giving us tips. Will definitely return.;4
This hotel is cool, we were in NYC for one night to celebrate my sister bday. I'm from Harlem originally but never stayed in a NY hotel. It has it down as a four star hotel. I wouldn't say that only because there is no pool or spa but overall the rooms are small but its New York. The bed was soooo comfy and the shower was everything.. The room served its purpose. We ate breakfast at the Tick Tock diner that's in the lobby. Food was banging, will definitely eat there again. You are basically paying for the location. Smack dab on 34th street access to shopping, eating, and action.;4
You couldn't wish for a better location when walking around Manhattan  Island. The hotel is showing it's age and is a little tired, but perfect for the business traveller.  As usual with American Hotels no tea or coffee making facilities are provided in the rooms with just an ice machine on alternate floors.;3
My kids and I stayed here and I couldn't  be happier.  From check-in to check-out, the experience was perfect.  We were close to everything!  If you are going to be touring, the Big Bus stop is right in front.  Times Square is just a few blocks away, subway stops are close in every direction, including Penn Station which is less than two blocks away. Shopping is three blocks away! The Tick Tick Diner has an interior entrance and the food is pretty good. I would definitely stay again. It was very clean and service was quick when I called for a blanket. What more could you ask for? Just a great experience for my kids and I. I was in room 832 and it was very spacious.  If street noises bother you, I would be sure to ask for a higher room but there was no noise from other guests.;5
We had a very nice time in NYC with our teenage daughters!  The New Yorker exceeded our expectations!  We reserved the metro double and then upgraded to the executive double by paying $20 additional per night. The hotel was clean and floor 7 was recently remodeled. We will be back.;4
Executive room cappuccino machine should be there. The coffee table should be there. Not enough k cup coffee.;4
Lovely hotel, but very busy. Good security in place. Close to everything. Clean rooms with good amenities but have to pay for internet, does include long distance phone calls. Did not use the other amenities therefore cannot comment on that.;4
Stayed for the night while in town for a show nearby.  Check-in was quick and friendly as was check out.  The lobby is huge and gorgeous.  Our room was on the 27th floor. The hotel was built in the 1929 and is an historical gem. The rooms are tiny but suited our needs fine for the night. I don't think we could have stayed for a week though as they are a little too small for that long of a stay. The beds were comfy, shower was extremely powerful, there was a safe in the closet and a flat screen TV.  No coffee maker in the room. Ice machines are on designated floors.  They store your bags for you for $2.00 each either before you check-in if your room isn't ready or after you check out if you have plans. Restaurant attached was pretty good too.  Subway was right outside. Madison;5
We arrived on a very HOT day to NY. I had rented two rooms for two nights. The front desk was great and tried to get us on the same floor.  I requested a refrigerator in my room and it was delivered almost immediately!  The room was great! Very clean! The bathroom was a little small but very modern and spotless! It was very quiet at night and I loved the big flat screen TV! We had a great quick breakfast downstairs in the diner type restaurant and loved being within walking distance to almost everything!! The staff was friendly and checkout was easy! I would make this my go to hotel for all of my visits except for one missing thing...no room service. I like the option of coming back late and being able to get something delivered to my room.  However, if that's not important to;5
Very beautiful place! Has that old post WW2 era Art Deco style throughout the building. I highly recommend staying here! Very close to Penn Station, there is a nice Diner in the lobby. Staff was friendly and polite.;5
"I have stayed here several times while visiting New York most recently in July.This is a great historical hotel and centrally located with the subway just a few steps out the door.The rooms are comfortable albeit small New York style.The staff have always been friendly, helpful and without exception have been able to accommodate my red-eye check in. It certainly could use a ""spring makeover"" but I will stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting New York.The hospitality, location and affordability can't be beat!";4
Hotel it's very good I'm stated in other occasions and now the rooms are  better but the service in the Tick Tock  Restaurant its a poorling experiance. The waiters are inattentive;5
Very poor rooms Not at all spacious and very congested.  The bathroom is also extremely small even though we booked a room for 4 people with 2 double beds. There is hardly any space to walk in the room. Not a good experience at all except that the hotel is located at a very prime location. There is no hospitality and even the receptionists didnt talk to us properly.;1
This hotel is a legend. We stayed in the recently remodeled room on 8th floor. At $157 in this neighborhood it was very good, though the room a bit small, a very comfortable bed, and stylish, art Decco style, furnishings. Dont miss the historical exhibit downstairs!;4
"Good location but no coffee making facilities in room, beds were short for someone 5'10"" or taller, the wardrobe had a safe taking up valuable space so couldn't be used and not deep enough for the hangers and our room with 2 double beds was tiny. The whole place needs new carpers and paint.";3
This hotel is situated on 8th Avenue, corner of 34th Street. It is in a very central position for all attractions. The Empire State Building and Macys are a short stroll away. Check in was very straight forward with a luggage check in if you arrive early and your room is unavailable. We asked for a high floor overlooking the Empire State Building and the views are fantastic. The room was small as you can expect in New York, the bed was comfortable and the room well kept.  Within the service charge you have free Wi Fi, telephone calls and use of the gym. Tick Toch diner attached to the hotel serves a very good breakfast. Visit the lower ground floor which illustrates the history of the hotel and famous guests that have stayed there.;4
Excellent location, in walking distance to Times Square, major theaters & restaurants.  Courteous staff. Yummy diner & Italian restaurant attached to lobby. Free WiFi. Pretty cheap, less that $200 for a last minute Friday night stay-over.  Clean & Quiet. Subway & Bus stop right outside lobby door.  Felt safe even at night and I was a woman alone. The 1930s/40s Art Deco Retro décor made me feel sophisticated and wealthy, lol. I LOVED my stay.;4
Room was fairly priced, clean, but small.  Canteen area on a different floor. Extremely convenient to subway, sites (Madison square Garden, Empire state, Central Park). Disconnect with valet parking and Concierge.  Guests compete with Taxis, Liverys, Uber, and  buses. The main entrance is a cluster.;4
The room was located in the back of the hotel which I loved, it was very quiet. I recommend to change the shower head, it's small and too old, also the water from the shower goes in the bathroom floor, and because this is a super small bathroom, it is not safe. otherwise it's a small but nice room.;5
"I've stayed here several times on business and have enjoyed it.  The rooms are typically small (it's NYC) but the beds are comfortable.  The lobby is beautiful.  The workout room is large with high quality equipment.  The location is excellent for anything you want to do; Penn station is right out the door so you can easily get anywhere in the city.  On one trip I arrived early (around noon) and asked if I could check in or drop bags and was able to get into my room right away.  There are a lot of elevators and one bank is an express for going above the 20th floor so you never have to wait long.";5
My nephew and I were spending only one night on our way to Vermont. I thought I'd booked a room with 2 queen beds but when we arrived they gave us a room with only 1 bed. I was pretty worried-- the room was quite small and there was not enough room for a rollaway. I don't know if this was my error or theirs, but they graciously gave us a different room with two beds at no extra charge! After taking my nephew to his destination, I stayed there another night, alone. The doormen and all the staff were extremely nice and very helpful. My only complaint is when I asked the concierge for recommendations on how to spend the evening he mentioned several expensive options. I decided to walk around and just two blocks down, the street (8th) was closed for several blocks for a street fair!;4
"We decided on this hotel because of an airline package through Jet blue Airlines. I called the day ahead to confirm reservation and to ask about early check in.  Our stay was 4 days. The hotel charge $75.00 for early check-in but this did not happen because they were fully booked.  We arrived at the hotel  little after 9 am; we went ahead a did pre-check in. We were told to come back about 2:30 the earliest. I was told that the hotel charge a resort fee of little over $20 per day , however because we did our booking through the airline it was $ 10. I am not sure why we were been charge a resort fee because this was not a resort and we did not utilize any of the services that the fee included.  We got to our room and I must say I was little disappointed. The carpet in the room";3
"Arrived at 3pm and was informed that our ""suite"" was not ready. Asked to wait for 20 mins which we did in the bar. Enquired at 3.30. Still not ready. Asked to wait 15 mins. Waited. Still not ready. 4pm we got the keys and made our way to the 23rd floor. First impressions are that this hotel is in serious need of a makeover. It's old, frayed carpets, off white/yellow paint makes it look awful. I was shocked when I saw the room, everything looked old. Mint green bathroom and the corners of the bath were black from years of dirt. Old brown carpet. The security also leaves a lot to be desired. Sometimes you are asked to present your key before entering the lift at the lobby, other times you are not. The public toilets below lobby level are filthy. Don't use them. The Tick Tock diner";3
We stayed 2 weeks in room 3139 which had great views over the Hudson River. Room wasn't huge but had bags of character (including proper closet!) and was clean with comfy beds. Air con was a godsend as it was still hot in NYC. The hotel has brown painted doors and terrazo floors plus many art deco features. If you like bland and modern you'll not like this. But if you want a hotel that is like NYC - friendly and bustling with energy, you'll love the New Yorker. The location is perfect - opposite Penn Station, near Port Authority bus terminal, a short walk to Macy's, Times Square and Empire State Building. Two stores - Duane Reade and CVS - are opposite for any essentials. If you can bear to shun the marvellous Tick Tock Diner there is a Dunkin Donuts and Maccy D's near. The;5
We stayed in the Wyndham New Yorker over the weekend.  We had a newly re-furbished room.  The staff is very professional, and look nice in their uniforms.  The hotel still has the feel of the 30's.  There is interesting memorabilia in downstairs and in the lobby.  Two restaurants, fitness center, etc.  We felt secure.  Our room was nice. It was clean.  We really enjoyed it and would definitely stay there again.;5
Though I mainly booked this hotel due to an offer at the time of booking (made it incredible value for money!) I ended up leaving there thinking I will probably book it again next time I'm in the city. The area is very busy and crowded but it's also very close to big attractions and super convenient for travel. You're right by Penn station and it made it so easy for us to get to and from JFK airport and any Manhattan location we wanted or needed by bus or Metro.  I didn't try the diner on the ground floor but it looked popular and the hotel staff was friendly and efficient at check-in despite the crowds. I received my keys already at noon which was a pleasant surprise as I had mentally prepared myself for quite the wait until 3pm but the cheerful receptionist took care of that;4
We stayed in the Wyndham New Yorker for one night. The hotel staff were welcoming and  very helpful. the Room was clean albeit a little outdated, but comfortable all the same. Handy location! Thank you!;5
The hotel helped me in my travel back to the airport.  It was a wonderful experience and their staff were very helpful.  Check in was quick and simple.  The room was super clean and comfortable.  My son was there to perform at Carnegie Hall and his experience with the group was the same.  Restaurants were in walking distance.;5
We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel since that's not really the point. But the room was a good size and there are two attached restaurants which were perfect for nights when touring made us too tired to leave the hotel. The location is great. One block from Penn Station and about 10 mins to the base of the empire state building. I would stay again;4
Great art deco hotel with the most efficient lifts in the world. Great little coffee stall in foyer. Plus the Trattoria on the side is excellent. All in all would definitely recommend this hotel for families or business.;5
It was a great experience and good location. The staff was very good and courteous. On the other hand the rooms are small and very limited area to store your luggage if you are travelling with your family;3
We found this to be a good, clean hotel with good service.  We'd tried to upgrade our room using a link in a confirmation email.  However, the type of room we requested was not available upon arrival.  An email informing us of this would have been nice - but that's the only complaint about our stay.  The hotel accommodated us by providing a smaller room until a larger one could be arranged later in the day - so no worries.;4
"Stayed as a group of 5 people and finding affordable, reliable legal accommodation in the city was hard. This place was around $3963 NZD (including all taxes) for seven nights, one room with two double beds and a fold out double in the lounge which was surprisingly comfy. Wifi included.  Location great; easy walking distance 8-10 blocks to most shows and times square, two blocks to CSSNY bus stops, only 1.5 blocks to Penn Station Amtrak terminus and Madison Square garden for shows.  Had a good diner style restaurant 'Tick tock' on site which was satisfactory for breakfast or when in a pre show rush but don't restrict yourself to one style as there are so many varied options within walking distance. The Italian trattoria was classy and not overpriced, the 60yr old plus italian";4
Entire staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  Hotel renovations were amazing!  GREAT location right on the corner of 34th St. and 8th Ave.  You can get on the trains downtown to One World Center, 911 Memorial, etc. at that corner (one shot, no transfers)!;5
The hotel is in a great location, situated two blocks from Penn Station.  When we arrived the receptionist found us two good rooms with some lovely views of downtown. The room was compact but had everything we needed - we don't spend a huge amount of time in the bedroom as we are always out and about. The Tik Tok diner was our place of choice for breakfast and I chose something different every day. The lobby can be busy at times but we just met our parents there and then headed out. Rooms were quite quiet even thou we are on a busy street and the air con was a blessing on the warm evenings.;4
One of my favorites for value, give the cost in NYC.  Nice to get upgraded - always a nice delight. Free internet is a real plus as other hotels in this price range don't necessarily offer this.  Good place for breakfast as well.;5
My husband and I stayed at the New Yorker for 4 days. We picked it based upon location. If you want walk and be close to it all this the location!!   Check in was quick and easy. The rooms are tiny and dated. I'm not sure if all the rooms are like that or if some have been renovated. I would ask next time when booking. The bathroom is also tiny and needs to be updated but I have to say everything was super clean.   We would probably return as you can't beat this location!;4
"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel and now I know that it wasn't a one time issue.  We arrived in NYC early and tried to check in around 10:30- there was no line at that time but we were told we couldn't be checked in at that time and to come back.  Came back around 4:30 or so and waited 30 minutes, in line, to check in.  UNACCEPTABLE.  The same thing happened on my first stay as well. Got to the counter and was given a Half Hearted ""sorry"".  Then!  When we were checking out we need to check our bags because our train was leaving later...I was told that it would be $4 when we check them and then an additional $4 when we picked them up.  I have stayed in many hotels in Manhattan (our daughter attends college there) and have never, including my first stay with the";2
"We have just had a fabulous 5 days staying at the New Yorker. The reception area is beautiful, the rooms are tired looking, especially the bathrooms. Very very clean but definitely need a revamp. After reading the reviews on the great coffee machine , iPod docking station and sky lounge/bar, we were alittle disappointed, as our 3 rooms had neither (must be in Executive rooms). Staff were not very forthcoming about the ""sky lounge"", it took us to asking 3 members of staff, where it was located. Apparently you need to book & it's only for breakfast, so no night caps with a view then. The lady concierge  was exceptionally helpful & very lovely.  The room tax, per night, seems to be at the receptionist discretion, our friends paid a lot less per night for their room, as we did on";3
This was my third stay at the New Yorker and not up to the first two. The room was very small, the rug damp, the safe broken and the bathroom not updated. The staff as always was very friendly.;3
Great check in everyone helpful most importantly the kindness of the front staff all wishing my son good luck and if there was anything they could do don't hesitate to ask although the room very very small Gogol for the purpose of the trip. Love tic tock in lobby;5
We stayed here for our first trip to New York and it was perfect! The location was great, right across from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. We had an awesome view of the city from our room. The room was small but comfortable. The hotel staff was great, friendly and accommodating. They answered all of our tourist questions. There is a diner in the hotel called the Tick Tock Cafe and a bar.  We got a great price for our stay. Loved the hotel, loved the city, will definitely stay here again!;5
I booked another hotel but this one was cheaper or So I thought!!! Turns out my bill included a facility fee and when I questioned the desk attendant she was rude and said this is non negotiable. I said ok but the facility fee says we used the gym and phone etc and we didn't she said its a fee everyone pays. Needless to say I wont be staying again;2
We arrived late and reception said we had only small rooms left but don't worry we will move you when you are out for the day- without us even asking some rooms have no view - city view rooms are the best  Good friendly service and nice breakfast in tick tock diner We loved the art deco interiors but i don't think deluxe hotel travellers would feel at home Some great room rates so we felt it was great value for money;4
"Very small ""metro"" room for the price. Bathroom needs to be updated!!!! Since the hotel was on 34st it was very noisy the ENTIRE night.";1
The room was beautiful. Mr. Mohammed, at the front desk, rocks. We arrived at the front desk and asked if it was possible to have an upgrade. He told us he would see what he can do given that the hotel was pretty full. He surprised us with a room that had a beautiful view of the empire state building. He called us 15 minutes later to ask us what we thought of the room. We were really impressed. Everything at the hotel was perfect. The suite we had included international calls and wifi.;5
My thoughts -  Pros - cheap, decent size room, friendly staff, very close to Penn Station which is why we booked it.  Cons - very tired decor. Rooms looked 1950's! In desperate need of a refurb. Lobby was ok but that was it. Cafe/restaurant that is linked to the hotel was very downmarket. I went in for an early morning coffee and there was a homeless person sleeping at one of the tables.   I wouldn't choose to stay here for a longer stay as the position is too busy and touristy. There are much nicer areas to base yourself at if you are visiting the city.;2
Stayed during a busy summer heatwave.  Room was cool and clean.  Beds and pillows very comfortable.  Shame that a 3 bed configuration not available for 3 friends travelling together.  Trundle bed was quoted at $29 per night which seemed excessive and don't think it could fit in the room anyway.  Other downsides were no refrigerator or tea making facilities which for a 10 night stay would have been a convenient and helpful addition.  Great location right in the thick of it and wonderful city views from the 32nd floor.  Love the hotels history and elegance and overall we enjoyed our stay.;4
While the hotel is very clean and nicely decorated, the room was only fine for a night or two.  The best part is it is across from Penn Station.  The front desk staff is not very friendly either in check in or check out.  The bathroom has no counter space, at least in the room that have not been renovated recently.  Again, clean but nothing special.;3
Nice big busy hotel. Location is perfect for tourists. Macys 2 minutes walk to the left, Empire State building a further 5 minutes. Madison Sq Garden 2 minutes to the right. 10 minutes to Broadway. Great view of the ESB. Rooms very small, but ok if you are only staying for a few days.  Staff very helpful.;4
Superb location on 34th and 8th,  near enough to midtown Manhattan but far enough away to be quieter.  The hotel is undergoing a facelift outside which seems to be ongoing.  No noticeable affect inside.  Rooms are comfortable if a rather dated. Air conditioning is excellent especially for us from more moderate climates.  Staff are also plesent.  The tick-tock diner is great value, huge portions, enough to split with two kids if you have family.  The bar on the other side is also very nice,  a great happy hour and plesent efficient staff. The hotel has two sets of lifts. One for 1 to 20 and another for 20 - 40,  they are a little slow to arrive but very big.   Check in is also a little slow but given the volume of guests, it is efficient.  When you are booking, note the mandatory;3
Fantastic stay, lovely hotel, would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again. Roll on 2018 😁 the next time we are planning to go. Staff were friendly and helpful. Hotel is in a great location, the perfect base to start your day. Rooms were clean and the beds were really comfortable.;4
Queue to check in about 10 minutes, this is a big busy hotel.  Had to wait a few minutes for a lift which became a recurring theme.  Standard room was clean but the bathroom was small and old.  The hotel is in the midst of busy Manhattan with Madison Square Garden right across the road and Times Square, Macy's and Empire State 10-15 minutes walk away.  The nearest subway station is right by the hotel and bus stop 2 minutes away.  The best thing about the hotel is it's fascinating history, built in the 30's famous politicians, gangsters, sportsmen and scientists have all stayed or lived here and the signs of it's former grandeur are still visible in the foyer, if you have a spare 10 mins look at the disp[ay at lower ground floor.  Would I recommend it?  Manhattan is very;4
Overall great hotel and the restaurant in the hotel is also great with good food.  We had a nice view on the 34th floor that we requested and were given so that was nice. The qconsierge was polite and welcoming.  Also loved that the hotel was near Madison and many other restaurants. Literally right in front of Madison.  Liked visiting the rooftop bar across from the hotel also so check that out if you stay here.   Do not go to the diner in the hotel ! Food and service were not good at all.;4
What a gorgeous hotel and very helpful staff. We turned up 10 mins before checking in time and room wasn't ready & told to come back in 45 mins.  After an hour the room still wasn't ready.  After a long flight we just wanted to get into our rooms and seeing how stressed I was,  a very helpful Muhammad at reception sorted me out with a room & for our inconvenience also gave us a very nice upgrade (a room with a view! - Empire State building no less)! The room was spacious and clean, only disappointment is that there is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.  Unfortunately our safe in the room was not working and the kindly let us have a safe behind reception until they managed to sort the problem out.  The hotel is in a fantastic location just beside Times Square and all;4
Stayed here on a few trips to New York. Its central, exceptionally clean and affordable!! On my most recent trip we got upgraded to a suite! It was spectacular! Loved every minute of my stay here. Will most definitely stay here on my return Couldn't rate it highly enough;5
Totally exceeded expectations .. Manhattan was a stop in our travels with our large family.  I searched high and low then decided on the New Yorker.  We just wanted a clean spot to lay our heads ... It was way more! The room was updated with vintage charm.  .. Marble in the bathroom with the flare of Art Deco and modern cleanliness.  The beds were very lux and comfy.  The view .. Amazing!! The location and convenience are remarkable! Walking distance to many major tourist spots .. Madison Square Garden, MoMa, Times Square,  Rockefeller Center, Broadway shows and so much more! Oh and the Tick Tock dinner .. We are there every morning! They were great, made feeding a family of SEVEN a breeze!    If you are on the fence .. Just book it!;5
We recently (today) came back from yet another stay at the New Yorker, and once again it met all expectations. Front desk staff was courteous (thanks for the upgrade!) and we ended up with a room on the 30th floor. Though our view was mostly skyscrapers (impressive in its own right), the Hudson River could be glimpsed between the buildings - all in all a nice sight. As always, room was clean and comfortable, and I was very glad not to have any drafty windows this time! Maybe they've taken the hint from my last couple of reviews, haha. In any case, as I said, another great stay at my favorite New York hotel. Enjoyed seeing all the photos of the hotel's history at the display on the lower level!;5
Location was food, room was clean and everything worked well but no tea making facilities.  Staff not overly helpful but pleasant enough. Check in and out was straight forward. Need laundry room, lots of people have a stopover in the big city before going on.;3
I loved this trip in particular. The rooms were tiny but the location of the hotel was so convenient. I got to see Madison Square Garden, Times Square and the Empire State Building. While my husband was in his meetings I walked around the city. It was great!  I had lunch n dinner at the Tick Tock Café and turns out that George Bush used that as a Campaign Headquarters.  I went downstairs and read up on all the great history of this beautiful hotel. There were many historical points of interest. I loved my trip. Looking forward to visiting again in the near future. Hopefully if all goes as planned - we will be visiting again in January 2017.;5
Decided to stay here again. Solo this time. Still a good review! Room didnt have a view at all but i wasnt fussed i was literally in the room just to drop bags or sleep. Bed was comfy after a long day in the city. Very close to everything. Staff was friendly as always. Rooms are small but for a solo traveller it was perfect. Will be back again!;5
We stayed here for 4 nights, and it was really good. The service was good, the location was amazing and the wifi connection was really great as well. The rooms were really nice as well. We were able to walk to great places as Times Square, grand central station, empire tower and top of the rock. And the penn station was right around the corner.;5
Three nights on the 35th floor, Thursday through Saturday nights!  Staff was absolutely great, so friendly and so helpful.  The hotel is in a great location and is beautiful, historic and clean.  The room was on the small side, but clean and comfortable.  We wouldn't have asked for anything different and already have reservations for 5-nights in August!!!;5
I arrived at the hotel after 5 hours of flying and all I wanted to do was to receive a nice welcome. But what I got was a non-impressive space to stay the night. The bathroom was quite small and the door didn't close well. The room as well was really small and for four people staying in one room it was a nightmare. The food from the restaurant was good though and some people at the hotel speak Spanish which was good because I'm Mexican and my family doesn't know a lot of English so that helped a lot. But still they can achieve greater things to live up to the expectations that they themselves set.;2
Stayed here for 9 nights in a 2 double bed room. Would of been nice if a kettle was in the room and also requested a fridge which we never got but were charged for, otherwise an enjoyable stay.  Ate breakfast in the Tick Tock diner 8/9 mornings. Ideal location for Madison Square Garden, Macy's, Empire State Building and walkable distance to Times Square, Broadway and Central Park. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.;5
When you walk in its beautiful lobby friendly staff..  Check in early great so far, room on 34th floor not bad look around small but nice.. Go into the bathroom this is what I founded gross.. Got my room change upgrade even now I have a view great right.. This what I found.. The first three pictures are from my first room, the second is the upgraded one, beautiful bathroom a little small but nice heated floors and all.. But the staff is very nice;3
So central and ideal for seeing the city. Art deco decor. Fabulous size rooms. Found the staff helpful and friendly. On site cafe good for cafe type meals. Close to train station and hop on  hop off buses. Would stay ther again.;4
Tiny rooms, but this to be expected in the city. Always very busy in the lobby and had to wait to speak with front desk multiple times. $2 per checked luggage after checkout. Close to the metro and very central location.;4
Clean room, great diner attached, excellent location for seeing the sights of the Big Apple.  Really enjoyed my second visit to New York City (this time as a 'grown-up') and got to return to a few places, including Rockafeller Centre, the Empire State Building and Macy's.  Would recommend taking a helicopter trip over the NYC skyline, as this helps you see all the sights and orientate yourself a little.;5
We love this hotel. We live in a location in which we could take the MegaBus. Let's us off at port authority take train one stop and u you are at the hotel.;4
"So I read many of the reviews about rude customer seevice, and excellent customer service, and moldy musty rooms, and clean fresh rooms, and I wasn't really sure what would happen when I got here. It's a HUGE hotel (2500 rooms) that is 75 years old, so I wasn't too sure what I would get. When I first checked in there was a line of people waiting to check in and another customer service rep poked his head out of the office door, but instead of quietly stepping back inside and ignoring the problem he immediately came out and started helping people. Then when I checked in I asked if there were any larger beds available than a queen, because I'm 6'1"" tall so I didn't want my feet hanging over like another reviewer. Without hesitation he upgraded me to a King bed with a view of the";4
"Very Disappointed! Was supposed to be a queen size bed room- lucky if it was a double; was supposed to include wi-go then added to cost; towel were tiny; toilet paper was on floor- no holder- tiny room, bare minimum amenities in room as well.  We will not return. We did call downstairs to question them wondering whether we were in the right room - and they said yes . Never again. Terry Moskowitz";1
My Husband and I stayed in the New Yorker for 5 nights in November.  Overall I would say the hotel was lovely! The room was small but spotlessly clean and when in NY you don't spend a lot of time in the room!  We did find it a little cold especially on the side of the room with a window!   The staff were friendly enough, especially the cleaner on our floor (sorry we didn't get his name) but he always had a good morning and wished us a nice day and even commented on my husbands new sneakers lol and yes we had to wait in line for about 15 mins to check in but check in very quick after this and we were in our room in no time  The best thing about this hotel is the location! We got the train from the airport to penn station and the hotel is literally a 2 min walk across the street,;4
We spent 6days in NYC during the heatwave.The New Yorker is a perfect place to return to from the crowded(yet exciting)streets, wonderful lobby area with very good a/c We ate at The Tick Tock every day,pleasant staff and quick service. Check in was great ,no line and no extra charges,even a local call I made from our room Was free.Security is good with smart polite men close to the elevators. We used the NY yellow water taxis to get about,there is a pier on 34th street and you can spend all day hopping on and off for 30 dollars,this is a great way to tour the city. Walk Brooklyn Bridge from Brooklyn towards Manhatten the views are goodTake a river Cruise and see the whole of the area,Ground Zero is a must as is Central Park and The  Empire State.We went to Baseball Game via the;5
We stayed here during our honeymoon . We was checked in by a gentleman called Miguel . Very nice and helpful.  We was upgraded to the 36th floor as we was on honeymoon we had a fab room with a view ! We offered complimentary wine as gift but as we don't drink we was given breakfast vouchers as a honeymoon gift , this was lovely . Tick tock cafe attached is great , great location, yes rooms are small but who stays in tneir in rooms! Tne gym was great , we used this , staff were friendly, we would stay , Thankyou New Yorker and Miguel too :);5
There was nothing bad about this hotel, the room was small but as I've not stayed anywhere else in NY I can't compare it. It was adequate though, and I got an extra single foldaway bed for my son at no extra charge. Other than that it did it's job. The great thing about it was the location - right next to a subway station, Penn station (which was handy for returning to the airport), and a short walk from the Empire State Building, Times Square, Madison Square Gardens and lots more. Everything else was easily reachable via the subway, which is by far the cheapest and easiest way to get around. I paid $75 on the way here to transfer by taxi from Newark Airport to the hotel as it was late at night, but if I came again I would get the train ($13 adult fare).;4
This was a great experience for me. Love the 30s Jazz decor, the restaurant was clean, nice, and affordable. We had a night of noisy pipes but after morning call it was fixed within a half an hour. I would recommend and I enjoyed my stay;5
A very nice and enjoyable stay at this newly renovated room. Front Desk Staff was pleasant at the front desk, had a good nights rest. The only thing I would have changed would have been the showerhead, the bed was comfortable and had a good stay. Rooms are small, though they really packed a lot into a small space. Would come back;4
I stayed with my family in two double bed suite with the view of the empire state building. The room is good for a family of 5. The sofa bed in the living is very comfy. The dressing room is perfect for luggage. Special thanks to Mr. Edris at the front desk for facilitating our check in.  The hotel is in a perfect location. Walking distance from everything. The security at the hotel is very respectable. Tick tock cafe is 24 hrs open.  I recommend the hotel to all type of guests.;5
Stayed here for my honeymoon july 2013,lovely hotel friendly staff and location is excellent not far from madison square gardens....would highly recommend this hotel to any friends or family and what an amazing city new york is!!!;4
We travelled here as a family in March 2013 to celebrate a 50th birthday. It was our first trip to New York and the hotel was perfect for what we needed.  The location is brilliant. Just up the road from Macys and The Empire State Building, and not far from Times Square and all the other main attractions.  We booked a standard room, but upgraded to a suite with views of The Empire State Building on arrival. The room was absolutely stunning, and very spacious for the three of us. I have heard that the standard rooms can be very small, so if you like your space, I would defo recommend upgrading to a suite.  We ate breakfast at the Tick Tock diner a few times and always had a good meal. Its convenient as its located at the hotel.  I would defo recommend this hotel to anyone;5
This hotel is run down, dirty and no better than a 2 star even by NYC standards.   Upon checkin the hotel stated there is a $29.99 plus Tax ($2.57) per day per room fee for wifi, health club and phone calls.  I do not use any of these services and it was not disclosed via Priceline and their fees.  This seems to be the new scam in NYC hotel circles.    I have used priceline for 15 years and have spent well over $50,000  on their site in in this time.  After 75 minutes on the phone they were unable to resolve the issue.  I was willing to purchase more expensive rooms via express deals  and provide priceline with the confirmation number and they were unable to help.  Looks like I will never use Priceline again.;2
Stayed at the New Yorker Hotel for 3 days. Checking in lasted 20 min. Than we had to leave the luggage at the luggage room of the hotel...another queue of 15min.. In total it costed is 35min just to check in... See foto of queue...  Staff are working under pressure. Service without a smile. Didn't feel welcome at all. Rooms are mediocre.   Location is brilliant. Despite this, will never come back and definitely will not recommend this hotel to anyone.;1
This our first trip to New York we were advised to book the Wyndham New Yorker.  After getting over how small all the rooms are in New York we found this hotel to be perfectly positioned for all our adventures. Macys two blocks east, Madison Square Garden one block south  and right above Penn St station. The hotel has a great diner attached along with a lovely Italian restaurant.  All rooms are styled in  art deco reminiscent of its former glory.  Well recommended for your first visit to see all the important visitor sights. Rockefeller Center , Empire State , Radio City, Times Square and Central Park.;5
It's hard to search for and find hotels in the City with two beds.  Was thrilled to find this with the New Yorker, and even more thrilled with the room and hotel! We booked a standard room with 2 double beds, and ended up in a very spacious (especially by NY standards!) corner room with 2 double beds that had been recently renovated.    The beds were comfortable.  We were on the 22nd floor with a nice view.  Street noise was not noticeable in the room.  The bed linens were fabulous and the beds very comfy.  The bathroom was smallish (typical NY) but had been updated so was clean, fresh and modern.  A huge bonus is that we never waited more then a few seconds for an elevator.  Unheard of in NY hotels.    Located almost across the street from Penn Station (we arrived by train),;5
this hotel was stunningly beautiful as we walked into the lobby after a 7 hour flight. We had a 2 bed 2 room suite to sleep 6. The room was perfectly good and the view was great with one bed having a view of the empire state and the other a view of the chrysler. The room was clean but quite tired and could do with a bit of a kick up the bum to bring it to modern day. We ate at the diner attached to the hotel for two of the breakfasts, the first was excellent and the second was good but the orders came out wrong. The diner is quite pricy and a voucher with the room might be a nice touch. The hotel was really near Penn Station but it was not noisy, maybe that was just because we were on the 34th floor.;4
Me and my boyfriend have come to New York for me 21st birthday it's amazing the hotel is in the perfect place see in a standard room witch are quite small but perfect because your never in them it's 5 minuets from time square there's shops All around you there's Maddison square gardens over the road an open top bus service the next street up trams next to The hotel the Empire State is 2 minuets walk and there a McDonald over the road from the hotel it's perfect seriously if your coming to New York this is where you want to be;5
Just returned from three weeks touring USA. Stayed in five hotels in all. This was the worst one we stayed in we hated it. It's huge which means big queues for everything. Check in queue took 25 minutes just to reach the desk which was a nightmare when you've been travelling and you have little ones. Checkout I had to queue again for 15 minutes as I needed to speak to someone about the facility fee charged, 31 dollars for one night stay. They said it included phone calls in your room, use of business centre, wifi access and fitness facility. Nowhere else I stayed made charges like this they gave these facilities except phone calls in your room for free! When I tried to use the business centre and phone calls in room neither worked. They did waive the fee for me in the end when I;1
Last month I attended the Fancy Food Show in New York City. The New Yorker Wyndam was in the perfect spot on the corner of 34 & 8th and the room was newly renovated and beautiful. We could walk to the Javits Convention Center. We found restaurants within walking distance too.;5
The room was clean and refreshing. I would recommend this property very much to other folks. The lobby areas and hallways were very tidy and the air was at a very good temperature. The Tick Tock is open all night which was a plus for us as we arrived later in the evening starving. I also ordered room service from them twice. The food was awesome. The waiters/waitresses were very friendly. I had a happy hour at the Italian restaurant on the premises and the bartender was super friendly and helped me pick out my happy hour munchies. The Oysters and Clams are delicious.;5
The Wyndham New Yorker has lovely, well appointed, renovated rooms.  The space is small but the comfort and amenities make up for that!  Excellent, comfortable bed and a/c system.  Good price with a great location.  Friendly and helpful staff!  Convenient business center and excellent fitness room.  Lovely large lobby which is connected to Tick Tock diner.;5
This hotel is in the perfect location for a stay in NYC. It's only a few blocks away from a lot of tourist areas you would want to see when visiting New York.   The rooms are quite small, but a decent size. Unfortunately, the one I was in didn't offer a fridge, microwave or anything of that sort. I am not sure if maybe the higher grade suites do offer this. As I didn't want to eat out for every meal these things would've been nice.   All the staff I encountered were extremely helpful and friendly. However, for 3 of the 4 mornings I was there I had housekeeping knocking on my door even though I can the Do Not Disturb sign on! I did not appreciate being woken up to knocking to tell them I didn't need anything when the Do Not Disturb sign is supposed to do that!   Otherwise, an;4
Great hotel!! I have stayed here 4 times now. Very central and only a short walk away from times square. The rooms are spacious and we got upgraded to a slightly bigger room on our last visit my only problem was there was only one bathroom previous rooms I have stayed in had 2 bathrooms. It has the added benefit of the Tick Tock diner cant recommend it enough great food at great prices!! The restaurant/bar is very good the cocktails are amazing and the staff very friendly.;5
My daughter and I opted for the Wyndham New Yorker because we would be leaving NYC via Amtrak from Penn Station and the location was ideal.  But everything else turned out to be excellent:  The room was clean, beds comfortable, and the view spectacular, even to a couple of people who know NYC well.  (And, yes, I do realize that not all rooms will provide that kind of view.)  Mohammed, our front desk clerk, welcomed us warmly and was very solicitous of my daughter who needs a cane.  He even double checked to ensure that our room would be functional for her.  I think that the prices are reasonable compared to others in the city. Do not miss the gallery on the lower level! The history of the New Yorker is the history of NYC in the 30's and 40's and the little museum is fascinating!;5
Took the train in from Virginia to Penn Station and brought 6 friends with me to NYC for the weekend. The New Yorker was perfect to walk to after a long train ride and easy to get to. Right down the road, checked in (a little long and some errors, but they made up for it) and then headed for the metro to Yankee Stadium. Everything we wanted to do was easy to get to from here and the location right next to the NYPD was an added bonus!  The hotel was a little older and rooms were not very big, but it was clean and amenities were average.  For the price in NYC it was perfect. The diner attached to the hotel was great and there was pizza, fast food and Starbucks right across the street. Never waited too long for a elevator and security was tight but friendly and welcoming.  The;4
The location of the New Yorker is great - lots to do around and very easily accessible from the train or subway. The staff was friendly and did a good job securing the hotel, as you needed a key to even enter the elevator lobby. While the room was small, you can't ask for much more in a downtown hotel. The bed was comfortable, the AC was great, it was quiet and the curtains kept the room dark in the daylight. The bathroom was a bit outdated and ventilation was poor but the water pressure was great. Will definitely stay here again.;4
I went to New York on July 1,2016. Hotel checking went pretty good. Got the room right away.  The room was small but it was clean. Bathroom also very small but clean.  The housekeeping was good also. Security was very good, no outsider could get in. All guest had to show room key to get into the elevator.;3
Well established hotel with great service.  The standard room is small but functional.  The adjacent Tick Tack Cafe has good food and fast service.  There is a pizza place directly across the street. This hotel is in a good location.  We used Uber when we needed a ride and were impressed.;4
I purchased 4 rooms for two nights at the Wyndham New Yorker, 481 8th Ave., New York on Priceline.  When we arrived at the hotel we each where charged a Facility Fee of $29.00 plus tax of $2.57 per day.  I inquired what this was for and explained I was not notified of this additional fee when booking.  The desk clerk informed me that it covered use of Internet, Gym, and any phone calls made in the rooms.  I explained we will not need use of the Internet, Gym, or phone calls in the room.  Didn’t matter fee was mandatory. I checked on line to see if the fee was noted when I booked just in case I missed it and they did not note fee in Express Deals.    But, if I booked it under the list view they did note the fee and charged you for it.   Because I booked it under express deals I;1
The location of the hotel was great- right next to Penn station and a few blocks away from Times Square. The lobby was beatitude and the staff was very friendly. However, once I got up the the floor where my room was, I was quite disappointed. The hotel was a dark brown color palette and it seemed sort of dirty. The room was very tiny and my view was of the side of the building. That would be fine except for the noise was unbearable. I was unable to sleep for both nights I was there. The location was great, but I don't think I will be staying there again.;2
the Wyndham New Yorker was a great hotel!  I had a conference at the Javits Center and this was a close enough to walk. Nice hotel although the room we were in was quite small.  But the staff was very accommodating and courteous.  They consistently checked our room key before we got on the elevator.  We could walk to most places we needed to go.;5
Stayed here as part of a package deal. The hotel is crowed and the front under construction. The desk was anything but cooperative the 3 times I had a request. The rooms at the 27th are quite small and the bathroom outdated. The location is nevertheless good;3
I can deal with small rooms I can even deal with the noise but I cannot deal with BLACK MOLD in the bathroom.  I was so disappointed in this hotel.  The employees were great but the hotel itself.... sucked.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.  Stay at the spend a little more and stay at the Marriott.;1
We had a great experience thanks to Ryan. He helped us find the best options for us and explained how to get the NYPass and what it included. We are extremely grateful for his help and his excellent customer service!;5
It is very good that you can reach to Penn Station easily. Times Square is just a ten minutes walk. But hotel is old. I think it deserves its price. Its history is also interesting. It is a very crowded hotel. So, check-in, check out, concierge services take time.;3
We drove all the way from Nebraska and were exhausted by the time we arrived, and frankly, felt like fish out of water.  However the hotel staff were amazing and helped us to fit right it, right from the start!  We got to NYC a day early and they were able to accommodate us.  This hotel has such a professional, yet comfortable, welcoming atmosphere!  The rooms are clean and housekeeping was super kind!  We never felt like we had to worry about any of our personal belongings when leaving for the day.  And after touring NYC everyday for 5 days, it was so nice to know we had our clean hotel to go to that we felt completely safe and comfortable in!!  Security is awesome at this hotel as well!  Great room, great view, and excellent location!;5
This hotel was nice and clean for a 4 night stay in July 2016. It is location very close to Times Square and good restaurants. After reading previous reviews, I was quite nervous about staying here on a business trip. Although it is old (and the hotel smells a little musty), all the rooms are updated. My room was small but very clean! The staff was exceptionally kinda. Also, it is pretty quiet for a NYC hotel, which was a nice surprise. Don't be scared by some other reviews on here - it's a clean hotel with a good location!;4
We stayed here for 3 nights & this hotel has the best location! Next to Penn Station, in front of Madison Square Garden,  walking distance to good restaurants & mostly everything that we wanted to visit including Broadway. 4 of us were really cramped in the room with 1 bed only in the 1st night but they then managed to move us to different room with 2 beds on the next day. The room is small compared to hotel rooms in other cities but we expected that already and still enjoyed our stay there. No complain for a room with Empire State Building view. We will definitely be back. Thank you, Wyndham New Yorker!;5
"Stayed one night earlier in the year, and boy was I glad I was there for only a night. Stayed at this hotel as I was stopping over from DC to catch a flight to Asia and thought it would be good to stay near Penn Station. Got a good rate for the room. Despite moderating my expectations, found the corridors Old and gloomy; rooms also dark and creepy. Hotel seems to enforce the 3pm check in time strictly - don't think the receptionist bothered to check if there were available rooms when I checked in at 1 pm after a 3.5 h train ride from DC. Extremely noisy rooms - sounds of water running through the pipes are incredibly loud, as are noise of doors closing, all starting from 6 am on the date of my departure.Not surprising given the number of guests staying in a hotel of this size.";2
Absolutly loved the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel. So conveniently located if you take the train in from Newark airport. 1 easy block to the hotel entrance. And way cheaper then a cab. Also walking distance to time square, empire state building, and Macys. The rooms were neat and clean. Great experience.;5
The hotel has undergone extensive renovation and looks and feels very nice.  The front desk staff was very helpful and upgraded us for our overnight stay.  The room was relatively large for a NY City hotel. The location of the hotel is near the Port Authority Terminal and within easy walking distance of many Broadway shows.;4
Friendly personnel, Nice ambient, clean, good service, 24 hr diner, next to subway and penn station which is an added advantage for staying over here..great location for NYC tour! Highly recommend for family or business tours.;5
Very beautiful classic 20's hotel. Very impressed by the size of our room which had a living room, bedroom and two full size bathrooms. It was plenty big for a family of 6. We had amazing customer service from everyone that worked at the hotel. I am super picky on cleanliness and our room was super clean. We were walking distance to time square, the Empire State building and Central park. The only downside was the cost of about 350.00 per night and the parking which I was told would be 50.00 per night and it was 70.00.;4
"I recently stayed here for 2 nights while I was in NYC. I loved the location and the close proximity to many ""must see"" sights in the city. It is within walking distance to the Empire State building, Times Square, Broadway, 42nd street and Penn Station. The hotel is pretty much busy at all times, but they do check to make sure you have a room key before letting you get on the elevators. My room was very small but I was expecting that. I really have no complaints and would definitely stay here again when I return to the city.";5
The Wyndham is ideally located to Penn Station and many sites.  Staff were very efficient and willing to help.  We paid extra to get an updated room which I'm not sure was worth it.  We ate at the Tick Tok restaurant  which is connected to the hotel twice, very convenient and reasonable.;4
"The New Yorker is 2 blocks away from Penn Station, which is extremely convenient if arriving/leaving NYC by Amtrak or other train.  However, the hotel is quite old.  The rooms and bathrooms are small and the furniture/carpet, etc, are a bit worn.  If you can upgrade to a suite, it is much better as many of the standard rooms are quite small.  The hotel is huge (40 floors) and so has a lot of traffic; but they are well set up with it with the lobby staff.  The workout room would be small, if this were a business hotel, but when we were there it was fine.  It had 3 ellipticals, one stepper. several bikes and treadmills, plus a full suite of weight machines.  There is a nice small coffee bar in the lobby for morning coffee and snacks.  The Trattoria restaurant is good, and the Tic";3
The hotel is in a great position near Madison square garden and it's easy to get uptown or downtown very quickly by subway. The hotel has a history which makes it interesting, built in the 1920's. Our room was small and functional. Price was reasonable but had to pay extra $22 a day. This can be included in booking price. Shower was unreliable because the temperature varied. Just adequate although the bathroom was fine otherwise. Good storage space. Thin walls so a bit thin and we could hear people outside and in the next rooms. We didn't mind because the rooms next to us were quite quiet.  Probably fair value for money considering its situation.;3
As well known as this hotel is, I found it to be old and run down.  I have stayed at better hotels for cheaper. The faucet in the shower was broken.  The room was old. The service was mediocre.  We asked for more towels and pillows and they didn't bring any.  Tried calling the front desk from our room and no one would answer the phones. The hotel is not close to Times Square.  It is 10 blocks away.  Not as advertised. The restaurant (Tick Tock) was horrible!!!  They got our order wrong (all 4 of us).  When we complained, they gave us a free bottle of water!!! Do yourself a favour and book another hotel.;3
We stayed here in May for 4 nights, was not disappointed, lovely clean room. The man on reception was very nice when we checked in, got a complimentary bottle of wine sent to our room . Perfect location . Ate breakfast each day in the Tick Tock diner, great , big portions but lovely to set you up for a day of sight seeing. Really nice hotel, perfect. wifi kept dropping off at times.;5
The only thing good about this hotel is the location.  It is near and within walking distance to many sites in town. This I the second time in two years I have stayed at this hotel.  From the exterior and lobby the hotel has a great old fashion look.  The room are very small. I estimate that they are about 1/3 the size of most hotel rooms I have stayed at.  The TV was not working correctly and several channels were fuzzy or unwatchable.  Ice was also hard to find. Ice was only on even numbered floors.  I could not detect any room service, but there are several cheap eat places near the hotel.;2
Room was very small with very little place to keep luggage and move around. Did not have provisions for tea or coffee in the room. Queen bed was comfortable and room service was okay. Front desk and other services were adequate. After adjustment o verbal stay was good.;3
We stayed at The New Yorker 4 nights while on our first visit to New York.  The location worked well for us, since we arrived in the city at Penn Station which is just a block away.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Our room, with 2 full sized beds, was quite roomy, clean and comfortable.  It accommodated all 4 of us easily.  The one thing lacking was a small refrigerator so we could keep some drinks cold.  We were on the 28th floor but never had to wait more than a couple minutes for an elevator.;4
Booked a double bed room. Room was very tiny and bathroom sink had no place to put anything, very inconvenient . Could be cleaner.;3
Room size was about what we expected for the city. Hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. They upgraded us to a larger room when they realized there were four of us. Room was clean as were the bathrooms. Security staff were always present and checking everybody's room keys. Staff was also very helpful in routing us to the subways and with directions. We will definitely stay here again on our next Manhattan trip.;4
The Wyndham New Yorker is an Arte Deco era hotel in the centre of New York that is well maintained and very comfortable. Our suite was on the 26th floor and, although we were unable to obtain an upgrade before we arrived, we were very happy with the room and the view out to the Hudson River. The reception staff member was apologetic about our failure to obtain an upgrade to our room and gave us a nice bottle of French sparkling wine as a welcome gift which was very nice and much appreciated after a long flight from LA.  The suite had a lounge room with TV, desk, couch and two armchairs, seperate bedroom with a double bed, TV and chest of drawers, and a seperate bathroom with a shower over the bath. The wi-fi was free and fast. All was scrupulously clean and, for the age of the;4
We stayed there for 3 days, July 1-3 for attending NABC2016. The moment we reached at the hotel, we were greeted by the staff members present there and escorted to the elevator by them. Although the security was tight they did not bother us as long as we were able to show our badge and other documents. We felt safe in their presence. It was a wonderful experience staying in the New Yorker. Thanks a lot.;4
We stayed for one week, they charged me with extra fees like parking when I never requested and I never had a car in NY, then I did a reservation with the $119.00 special they offer in internet, but the charged me more at the end because it was a weekend. I expected a better information before you get this hotel. Now, I must deal with back charges from my bank and deal with this problem.;1
We usually visit friends in the city, but decided to stay here for its central location and ease of access to Penn Station. The location for those travelling in and out of Port Authority, Penn Station or one one of the midtown bus stops, is pretty amazing. We were just a short walk from our bus stop.   The hotel is very historic, which was the dealmaker for us on this property vs. others in midtown. The lobby is a beautiful Art Deco one and the bottom floor with the fitness center has a mini museum on the hotel.   The hotel has been renovated, and while its very old, thats part of the charm: Winding hallways, old elevators, etc. The room we had was small, but all we really needed was a place to sleep and shower- for a longer visit, it may have been close quarters. Even though we;4
The hotel is steeped in history and conveniently located:  in close proximity to the many of the main attractions that most first time visitors have on their bucket list.  For a simple meal, Tick Tock Diner is located in the hotel and is open 24 hours.  There is also an excellent Italian restaurant.   Our room was small, but clean.  Our bed was comfortable. The housekeeping staff, front desk, and all other staff members were very helpful.  To make the most of our last day in NYC, we checked out but had our bags stored at the hotel until we were done sightseeing.  The fee to store our bags was $2.00 per bag.;4
The New Yorker is a famous and very large hotel dating back to the 1920s. When you go into the hotel it has a modern and very spacious feel but still pays homage to the original  Art Deco style - the chandelier and ceiling in the reception area are a great example of this. In the basement there is a very interesting exhibition of photographs showing the history of the hotel and some of the celebrities who have stayed there. Some reviewers have commented on the size of the bedrooms, but our twin bedded room was really large and very comfortable and with fantastic views of the Madison Square Garden and the Empire State Building. To lie in bed with the curtains pulled back and see the ESB illuminated at night was a wonderful experience. Unfortunately the bathroom did not match the;4
I stayed in this hotel for two nights at the beginning of June. Ended up on 8th floor without a view other then building next door but room was very clean and comfortable albeit small. Bathroom had just a shower which was tiled and nice. If you are alone this is an OK hotel size-wise. Two people would have been cramped I think. Hotel has restaurant connected to lobby which was reasonably priced for NYC standards and food was good. I used Wyndham points to stay here so can't comment on pricing. I would stay here again but a couple other hotels I've stayed at nearby in the past had larger rooms.;4
This Hotel is an Art Nouveau building that has been appropriately refurbished, though some important items were forgotten: pluming and soundproofing must be Wyndham's top priority in order to become a very satisfactory experience, instead of an average one. The location is fantastic and is the best asset of this hotel. Amenities are below average and cleanliness can improve. Overall service is good, considered and attentive.;4
The hotel is well located on 8th Avenue, a short walk to Times Square. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel and a 24 hour diner. The gym is sensational for a hotel and the staff are excellent. Rooms are very small, don't pay extra for a view as all you see is the building next door.;1
Good quality hotel in a very convenient location.  Rooms are little small .  Queen bed almost took entire room.;4
"The lobby was bright and inviting, great for tired tourists returning from an exciting day touring the ""big apple"". This hotel gives guests a hands-on experience of its historic location in a small museum below the building, accessible through the lobby, which is a convenient way to pass the time waiting for a cab or tour-bus. Though the room I requested was not as roomy as expected, my stay was delightful, with two comfy beds to fit anyone's comforting needs. The room also came with a spacious closet, large enough to fit a small floor-mattress in (which can easily be provided by room service on-dial). The hotel is set in a fascinating location, in the heart of Manhattan, which can be seen from the windows in the apartment. When hungry for a sweet bite, the hotel offers";5
"Where do I start?  We had a ""renovated"" room.  If that was a ""renovated"" room then I would hate to see a non ""renovated"" room.  The bathrooms are very small - I'm talking 5x7.  I know this is NY but this was ridiculous.  Every other hotel that I have stayed in NY had larger bathrooms.  The A/C did not work properly the first night and we had to switch rooms on the second day.  (Our first night price was reduced by half price).  They also have an attendant by the elevator that you must show your room card every time upon entering the elevators.  I thought this was a very cheesy gesture.   I have never stayed at any hotel where you have to show your room key.   Last time I was in NY, I stayed at the Waldorf - Do you think you have to show your room card there??  Not hardly.  The";1
I've got a trip planned for NYC next week and I have this hotel booked from July 14-20. I am extremely nervous about my experience given all the bad reviews. Obviously the people who paid for the premium rooms will get premium services, but those who reserved a standard room, like me, will have to be weary of any extra charges and disappointing rooms! I really hope we get at least 2 beds for our rooms but I keep hearing the majority of people will only get 1 bed. Sighhh. I rarely get time off from work and this is the only holiday I have planned for the year. I hope its enjoyable. Thanks for all the reviews guys! Expectations has been established.;3
This was an eye opener of a city this is my ideal world to live in what a beautiful city also with its downsides but I always try and find the beauty writhing things! This hotel was another favourite of mine the only problem was the smallish room but what can I say it's New York! But it was still beautiful and the window wasn't that big but we still have a lovely view of the city and the sun setting on the city ! Thy gym was good all facilities were overall great I just wish there was a pool or they light if had one but I didn't know. I would defiantly recommend this hotel and city to tourists as it is a place to see!;4
Nice hotel and very comfortable bed. Room size is small but very organized and clean. We enjoyed it a lot!;4
My wife and I stayed at the New Yorker for four nights as part of our honeymoon. The hotel is superbly located in Mid Town, just a couple of blocks away from the Empire State Building,  The hotel looks splendid. It was clean and comfortable and the art deco stylings are a joy. The lobby looks amazing. Staff were very polite and helpful, especially Suzie on the Concierge desk.  Our room was a little on the small side , but perfectly adequate for our needs with a good bathroom and shower.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again should we return to New York.;4
Excellent I highly recommend this hotel I have been staying at this hotel for over 15 years and every time I visit it is better Bedding is the best and the staff is very friendly Two restaurants so you really do not have to leave the facility if you so wish;5
Perfectly located for transport links and exploring the city.  The hotel itself is full of old style charm, one can just imagine how it would have been in old times not to mention the celebrities who  used to frequent.  Past the foyer and the banks of wonderful old elevators it is however not so grand. The vestibules are stale like an old theatre. The rooms are tiny as most other NYC hotels. However they have tried to make them comfortable. Bed was sized to fit the small room but linens were fresh/clean. Bathroom, old but functional.  In summary, lovely old building with history, great location which compensate for small rooms but then who spends time in their room when in this city!?;4
A renovated Deco Hotel that brings a glimpse of the past into the future. I was traveling solo so the small room was comfortable. The décor was modern and neat with various pictures of the original hotel on the wall. The staff was wonderful. The front desk was tremendously helpful and made sure I had everything I needed. The security folks although seemed leery to me at first, but I realized they were there for my protection. I felt very safe. The cleaning staff was very friendly and accommodating. The hotel is not far from Macy's and many other stores. Madison Square Garden and Penn Station is diagonally across and down the street.  The next day I had to catch the 7:15 AM train to Toronto, so the convenience of Penn Station helped me with the rest of my travel plans. I look;5
Though quite expensive by my standards, it was a good hotel in a very good location. The checking in and checking out staff was very cordial. The bellboys, who stored our luggage, were cordial and helpful.;4
"I one time read a post from a hotel in Costa Rica I was considering. It stated that in Costa Rica 4 star hotels are different and can be considerably more rustic than 4 star hotels in other part of the world. I am now a few days removed from my stay at the Wyndham New Yorker and am still pondering if the Wyndham New Yorker considers itself on the same spectrum as Costa Rican hotels. Let me begin by stating that this hotel charges a $22 fee upon check in, in addition to what you pay to spend the night, for honestly no reason. They state it is for wifi and gym, etc, but frankly charging for wifi is very 2008 and not conducive to what modern hotels should provide its guest. The most appalling thing about this $22 ""hotel fee"" is that upon check out, if you would like to walk around";2
The New Yorker was everything I expected it to be....great heritage (lower lobby is a must-see), service (efficient check-in and out), security (have to show keycard in lobby), location (easy access to subways, buses, and taxicabs), within walking distance to many NY tourists attractions. Express elevators was a definite plus.;5
I love this hotel is easy to get to by train or if you're driving. The staff was excellent and even recommended a place to park my car where I would receive the discounted rate. There is lots to do nearby walking distance to time square and theatres.;5
very nice hotel, friendly staff and great location. Highly suggest the valet parking. Tick Tock restaurant on street level is very good and affordable. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to everyone.;5
We had a wonderful stay at the New Yorker Hotel.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the view from our top floor room was breathtaking!  And we want to also mention that the sofa bed is the most comfortable that we've ever slept on in all our travels!;5
We stayed at this hotel during the 4th of July weekend.   The New Yorker, Wyndham Hotel is a historic hotel located at Eighth Avenue & 35th Street in New York City, United States. The 43-story Art Deco hotel opened 1930 and is located in Manhattan's Garment District and Hell's Kitchen areas, near Pennsylvania Station, Madison Square Garden, Times Square, and the Empire State Building. The hotel offers two restaurants and conference space. Since re-opening as a hotel in 1994, it has undergone capital improvements, including lobby and room renovations and infrastructure modernization. The Unification Church purchased the building in 1975, and since 2014, it has been part of the Wyndham Hotels & Resorts chain.  We were here as part of conference with hundreds of other attendees.;4
Clean, friendly and so helpful. Parking is limited, but hey, it is NY. They do all they can to help with that too. Rooms are small but very functional, are you there to see the city or sit in your room?;5
Let's face it, you get what you pay for.  Yes, the rooms are small in some hotels (this one included) but hey, what's important?  A big room?  An in-room coffee maker?  There is a diner right in the hotel for your coffee fix and there are two, not one, Dunkin Donuts coffee shops a block away.  Beds were comfortable, pillows ample and a clean bathroom.  What more does one need?  This hotel is a short distance away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square and the room prices reflect that.  The staff at check-in were friendly and engaging.  I'd would stay here again.;4
Ideal to explore NewYork from we stayed for 3 nights ok the room is a bit small but we had enough room for us both, The bathroom is a bit dated but so what it was cleanand the room was cleaned everyday. We were able to check in early at no extra cost yes we had to pay the extra fees but we had been told about this before.We had no problems with the staff they were all helpful .;4
"The rooms are tiny like shoe boxes, no coffee/tea making facilies, bathroom is also tiny and in need of updating,bath tub didn't even have a plug, not that it was big enough to bath in even with my tiny height of 5ft 3"",  there was someone else's flip flops under one of the beds along with a mouse trap which we only noticed when heckling we hadn't left anything behind when leaving , reception staff not very friendly, charged extra facilities charges of 27 dollars per night on check out, they take this from the credit card they insist you give them on arrival in case there is any damages they charge you 45 dollars per night that they refund apparently, I'll check that when I get home, which was not explained to me at check in, we did not use any facilities oh apart from the so";2
I was informed that this property had undergone a renovation...I would like to know when that happened.  Room was very small.  Almost too small for two people.  I wouldn't recommend it if you're there to see the sites, because it's a taxi ride or subway ride to anything.  The bathroom was clean, however tiny, tiny.  No way two people could be in there at one time and there was only a small shelf for toiletries.  The layers and layers of paint around the window near the tub kept flaking off...it was really kind of disgusting.  Bellmen were kind, but that's about it for staff.;3
Very comfortable beds and historic art deco hotel with real New York feel.  Great location close to Penn Station, Macy's, High Line, Times Square and adjacent to subway station. We got a roomy suite but many of the rooms are tiny.  Tic Toc Diner off of lobby was added convenience.  Bathrooms are tiny as are many of the rooms.  Halls don't seem to have been renovated and are a bit dingy seeming.  No coffee maker in room although I see on reviews you can request one for added fee (no one told us).  Staff was hit or miss - mostly pleasant but some indifferent.;4
They cheated me. On the website they advertise, if you stay 3 nights you get a night free. I stayed 5 nights and they charge for every single night. The front desk gentleman was Rude when I mention it. I will never stay here again. They were charging $149/single Metro room and they charged me $189 on top of NOT GIVING The FREE night. You decide if this is cheating or what?  Location is good..;1
We were only here for 1 night but it was a good stay. Hotel was in arrest location, super close to Penn Station and Madison square garden.  It was a short walk to TimesSquare.  We checked in and were given an older room so we went to front desk to switch to a renovated room and if read super easy to switch (thank you front desk).  The renovated room was very nice.;4
We had the misfortune to stay here for 3 nights over July 4 weekend. The room was a size of a closet, the mattress was rickety and gave us a back-ache. The sink would not drain, the furnishings & plumbing was a throwback to the fifties. No coffee-maker, no bottled-water, plastic cups, watered-down toiletries. The prices were outrageous and behavior of the staff was condescending, unfriendly and often in-correct information was passed out. No idea who rated this hotel so highly - we had a choice of several surrounding places but we relied on previous ratings. Wyndham needs to spend money to upgrade the physical facilities and hire better staff.;2
New York is what it is in terms of hotel room. To get a nice sized, luxury room in a good location you need to pay big bucks. This hotel does a job. Yes the rooms are small and dated, but if you just want to explore NYC it's a great location. Ten mins walk to Times Square, ten to Empire State, 20 to Central Park. Plus it's right next to a subway.  Couple of things annoyed me. 23 bucks a day (non optional) for basically internet - that's ridiculous! Plus being charged 2 dollars per case to hold your luggage. It's not the money, but I have never at any hotel in the world been charged for them to hold my luggage.;4
Very centrally placed hotel from the 1930's with a rich history,  some of which is told in an interesting display on the lower level. I was there for 7 days initially and was lucky to be put in room 1951 with a great view towards the Empire State Building and a little more space than some other rooms. Housekeeping is efficient and the rooms are clean and well maintained. On checking in a week later for my last night in New York before leaving the US I was asked to the Members check in desk.There Mohammed (I hope I have his correct name) was very obliging and arranged room 3730 for me with a view over the city to the Hudson River. A very nice way to say goodbye to the city. I ate at the Tic Toc diner on a number of occasions and the staff were always pleasant and obliging. On my;4
The room we stayed in was tiny (not enough space to lay down a large suitcase), dingy and so outdated. I couldn't walk barefoot, disgusted how soiled with dirt the carpet was. And the bathroom...UGH! No proper exhaust and space to put your toiletries. Bed was lumpy and so uncomfortable. Small TV, no mini ref nor coffee maker. Don't get lured with the low promotional rates posted with third party agencies since there are additional hotel charges.The only redeeming factor is the location if you want to be in the garment district and Korea town. The metro (Penn station) is only a minute walk and about a block from Madison Square Garden and about 3 blocks to the Empire State. They offer valet parking but you have to allot wait time of about 15-20 minutes before you get your car.;2
Samira, at Check-in, was very friendly and helpful. Rooms are small and we were assigned an inside room with double beds where you feel the walls are crowding on you. We paid for early check-in, and had to take whatever room was available, so can't complain much. We could not make the coffee machine work and there is no kettle for hot water. Other room amenities are reasonable. Floor staff and Lobby staff are all very friendly and helpful. For visitors, you have to remember that there are other taxes  added to the room rate, and you must ask for a rate with taxes to get an idea of what you will have to pay.;4
Hotel was very clean and staff were friendly. Great location central in the city and not to far from most things. The only negative (which is the case in most NYC hotels) is the 3pm check in but you can leave luggage at the hotel prior to this time;5
Classy old hotel in a great location near penn station. Really exceptional   staff - every one I encountered was pleasant, interactive and went above and beyond. At check in, they got me a larger room, removed the facilities fee, and gave me a drink voucher for the bar - all without asking. The room was typical NYC small, but very comfortable. Bathroom fixtures could use updating, but all in all a good stay.;4
We stayed in May for 4 nights.  The location is excellent to explore downtown and uptown NYC.  Rooms are small but adequate for a few days, and are authentic Art deco!  The Tick Tock Diner is part of the hotel and offers a genuine American diner experience 24/7.  Try the eggs benedict!  This was our second visit so we can certainly recommend the New Yorker.  Paul & Di;4
This hotel is vintage, with Art Deco decor therefore you stay for the history and location which is central and very convenient for penn station and port authority station, Madison square garden Macy's and the Empire State are all within a block  Our room and the public areas were always clean and tidy. Hotel feels safe. The only down side was no drinks facilities or fridge in room although coffee making was stated on hotel site. We would be happy to return;3
Dirty, filthy,disgusting,repulsive,bug infested,awful,old,falling down,piece of garbage,loud,overcrowded,looks like welfare hotel,filled with the dregs of society , in desperate need of renovation.  This is by far the worst place I have ever stayed ! To think they have some how gotten a 4 star rating is incredulous ! This place is a DUMP ! And they have the nerve to try to scam the poor souls who have unwittingly booked a room at this hotel of horrors with extra charges !! Literally the bathrooms have holes in the walls where the rats must live ! In this disgusting flea bag hotel they supply no coffee maker or fridge but tell you at check in that they will gladly supply one if asked. They don't mention its at an additional expense. Stay away. Far far away. This is a 2 star at;1
The New Yorker is located closed to Macys and is convenient to the subway. This is a clean hotel, beds are comfortable. Staff is friendly  and I feel safe when traveling here. It has alot of history. Keep in mind that it is an older hotel and the bathrooms are very small.;4
We loved the convenience of walking across the street from Penn Station to our hotel.  Subway stations were on the corner adjacent and across the street, so we got around the city on foot and by subway for 8 days.  The Tick Tock Diner (connected) was convenient and served delicious breakfasts.  Our room was a good size, but the bonus was that it had two (small) full bathrooms - very helpful since our 11 y..o. granddaughter was with us.  Would definitely stay there again!;5
We got one of those Priceline Express deals where you don't know which hotel you are getting until you've bought it. We were pleasantly surprised with a clean room with two standard beds, a clean bathroom, an efficient cheerful check-in, very personable valet parking, and a helpful guy behind the desk at the information counter. True, there were a lot of people around in the lobby and there were always other people on the elevator, and the room was compact. I'd definitely return, though,without hesitation.;5
Rooms are a bit stuffy but huge for Manhattan hotels.  Bathrooms tiny. Front desk helpful.  Great location.;4
Our stay was great. The beds and pillows were fantastic. I appreciate comfortable beds as someone who has had multiple back surgeries. Sleep in comfort and woke up without pain.;4
Very big hotel and rooms are what you would expect in New York - small but functional. They've recently renovated and the new touches such as the iPod docking station are obvious. Well equipped gym but not very well maintained. Good security at hotel lobby as you need to show your key card before they let you into the lift lobby. Front desk was a little off- putting and did not make a good first impression. The young African American lady seems very reluctant to give me my key card when I returned for them after they telephoned me to say that my room was ready - sullen, unfriendly and totally unpleasant. Due to this experience, I checked out online in my room as I refused to deal with the front desk staff when it came time to leave. Housekeeping was good and efficient. Room;3
We have just returned from a great 7 night stay at this hotel. Ideally situated.  Easy to get to from JFK airport.  ( get the air train to Jamaica station $5 then the LIRR to penn station $7.25 which is 2mins away and easy even with suitcases.)  We were on the 36 floor with amazing views of both the Hudson river and towards the One World Trade Tower and state of Liberty. Staff were friendly, you can store luggage if too early for check in or you have a late flight on your way home for $2 per piece.   Safe in room with good WiFi access. Would definitely stay again.;5
Amazing stay with my two year old baby- it's a beautiful hotel with character and right In mid- town. Nice neighbourhood. Macy's and shopping two blocks away, restaurants down stairs, Tick Tock diner does ring in orders which you just pick up downstairs and take to room so handy with a two year old you can't take to restaurants. Nespresso machine was handy, ice bucket in room so you can bring in your own preferred wine- the hotel is relaxed just what I like. My room was upgraded and I couldn't have been happier. Staff made my trip amazing- especially dealing with Krystal.;5
we stayed in a newly refurbished floor as per the front desk but the bed was so uncomfortable and no one answered the front desk line when we called from our room.  Accommodations were clean though.  Friendly help.;4
An excellent spot. The staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel was very safe and secure. The views from our room were spectacular. The location is great for all midtown activities. We highly recommend a stay.;5
We got to the hotel and checking in was pretty fast and smooth. Muhammad was nice and professional. The staff seem to have fun working together. One thing that bothered me was their mandatory facility fee. We got charged about $32 a night for amenities that we never used. The hotel seems well kept a few things need to be updated but I love how they kept most of the building as is. Just wished they polished or cleaned some bathroom tiles more, the corners of the bathroom where pretty filthy when we got there but if your just there to shower, sleep and go sightseeing it really isn't that big of a deal. Staff is great and courteous, housekeeping did call us to see if we needed anything since we had the do not disturb sign up the whole time.  The view from our room was amazing and;5
I can't say enough good about this hotel and my experience staying there!  For starters, I don't think I've met nicer staff in a hotel - especially in NYC.  They are genuinely interested in making your stay as pleasant, comfortable, and unencumbered as possible!  Yes, the room was small, but I was by myself and didn't need any more space.  I actually found it cozy.  It was spotless and I loved the glassed-in shower!  The bed was super comfortable.  The upgrade is definitely worth it.  I liked that the hotel checked guests for room keys before allowing them to use the elevators.  When I was leaving to go home, I found that my train was delayed and I was going to have an extra several hours to wait.  The hotel allowed me to check out an hour past checkout time, with no additional;5
I'm a big believer in that the person that checks you in at the front desk sets the tone for your hotel stay. This was my first time staying at the Whyndam New Yorker and it will NOT be my last. Linda at the front desk was cheerful, accommodating and genuine. The room was on the smaller side but I'm used to this in Manhattan. Excellent diner attached to the hotel, wonderful neighborhood and happy hour cantina across the street. Hotel was also very quick to get me a last minute taxi and convince driver to drive me to La Guardia even though he stated a couple of times that he only wanted to go to JFK. Made it to my flight just in time! Can't wait to be back!!;4
We chose this hotel because of it's style and location. Walking distance to Madison SQ Garden, Penn Station, B&H photo, Empire State. Remember this isn't the most modern hotel, but it's been kept fresh and clean. Things like abundance of outlets and lots of room around the bathroom sink aren't why you come to this kind of hotel. The diner on the ground floor, Tic Toc Diner is a GREAT value and convenient.;4
The room was nice and large and had a great view of the Empire State and the Chrysler Building but it was in need of a revamp. The headboard had a tear in it which was only small but could have been fixed easily enough. The main reason it got 3 stars was the bathroom. Tiles that had been painted over is not acceptable and fixtures and fittings were tarnished which only contributed to the overall tatty appearance. There is a charge of $22 per night for use of the facilities including wifi (even if you didn't use them). I did say I thought this was rather expensive as we would not be using the gym and so they charged us $11 per night;3
great location with easy access to transportation, midtown, shopping etc. rooms are small but renovated and clean..bathrooms are tiny and the sinks are super small but had a corner room and it had a small seating area which made the room seem larger..2 closets was a plus..live locally but stayed with family that came in for a few days and 3 of us shared a room and it was somewhat tight..full size beds instead of queens in this room which isn't bad if you're not hsaring with someone.;4
I stayed at this Historic Hotel on the 26th of June. As a native New Yorker I have always been curious and impressed by the history of this hotel however I was certainly not impressed with the accommodations. I paid a $20 upgrade for a Metro queen bedroom with a view. When checking in I was told that they did not have single beds and I was given a double bedroom. I was assigned a room on the 34th floor. The room was extremely narrow and everything was very close together. The bathroom was not very pleasant to look at as it too was extremely small and had chips of paint missing from the fixtures as well as a missing towel bar that left protruding ceramic end pieces in the shower. The only thing pleasant about the room is that the bed was fairly comfortable and I did have a nice;3
We stayed here in mid June for 4 nights. Our stay was very pleasant!! Rooms were very clean and the staff was remarkable.  The location is perfectly located near MSG and Herald Square. You literally are in the center of the city! Penn Station is located just out side the hotel and 34th is just a couple of blocks up. I would definitely stay here again the next time we are in the city.;5
My room was really small. Despite this I slept well.The only aannoying thing was the bathroom. There is nowhere to put your toiletries as the shelf provided is really small and narrow. Had to put my stuff on the floor. I didn't eat in the hotel but plenty of places to eat nearby. Was able to walk to the highline in around 12 min which was really e;4
Quick check in, Rooms are quite small but as you wont be spending a lot of time in the room it isn't really a problem. Clean rooms but they are in need of an update. No kettle in room, I would have packed take a travel kettle had I known. Paid a room levy when we booked in, this covers Wi Fi in room & lobby. I found out phone calls were free of charge on our last day ,check with reception regarding long distance international charges. Tick-Tock restaurant in hotel very handy for quick bites to eat.;4
We stayed there over Easter this year.  Great location, rooms are not big but ample for stay and very clean. We had a great view of the Empire State building.  Staff very friendly and helpful, tick tock diner is worth a visit.  Hope to go back next year for our golden anniversary.;4
"I booked the ""parking package"" when I arrived they did not know what it was then told me I could self park or valet then take them back the ticket I did this and they said no you cant self park. I spend so much time dealing with this issue I waited in lie at the desk 4 times! I waited while they ""checked"" on the issue and on and on only for them to add $30 on to my credit card for the valet parking that I never used and why did I the parking package and still pay for parking? I lost about 2 hours of my very short time in NY over this! 1 of the ladies was really rude and told me it was all my fault anyway. The person that told me to self park actually gave my sister directions on the phone of where and how to do so.";3
Stayed at the New Yorker 7th-10th June and loved it!! The location is perfect for accessing Manhattan by foot or subway and we had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. We had really easy check-in and outs. Rooms are small but not to the point of being problematic and I loved the Art Deco design and the hotel always appeared clean.  The Tick-Tock diner and hotel bar and restaurant were excellent and we always are well!! In fact I would return purely for the best shepherds pie I have ever had - and that's saying something coming from the UK!!  Beautiful hotel in a excellent location - would definitely recommend to others and stay again.;4
Location, location, location.  This gorgeous historic hotel puts you in the heart of midtown, with easy access to the Theatre District, and other points of interest.  The subway entrances were just around the corner, and Penn Station/Madison Square Garden just short block down.  As a tourist, I appreciated the security measures the hotel used and the cordiality extended by the staff.  We ate at the adjoining Tick Tock Diner and had happy hour at the adjoining bar, for pleasant and convenient meals after the theatre.  As a tourist, visiting NY can be daunting, and the availabliity of tourist-oriented services such as the The Big Red Bus or Gray's tour lines with easy on, easy off, increase the enjoyment of our stay.  The business center was great for printing our return travel;4
The Wyndham New Yorker Hotel is a superb facility.  The team members were always polite and helpful.  The food at the Tic Tock (Cafe) was always GREAT!  I will ALWAYS choose to make reservations, in the future, here!;5
A wonderful hotel in the heart of downtown New York only 8 bucks to Time Square.  Really good security requires you to show your room key every time you walk from the lobby to the elevator.  The rooms are very small yet efficiently laid out.  This hotel has a museum in the basement level that is related to the hotel and famous guests such as Nikola Tesla who lived at the hotel for several years.;4
Classic Art Deco hotel with a vintage feel. Our family of four appreciated the room upgrade - 2 bathrooms were awesome.  Located on 34th street within easy walking distance of shopping and Empire State Building/Madison Square Garden. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Two restaurants in the hotel offer options if you don't want to go out for food.  Would have been nice to have a fridge and coffee maker in the room but all in all a great stay in a great location.;5
I went there on business, and everything was ok - bathrooms tend to be on the small side, but I found the hotel crowded with tourists. This is not surprising given the time of year and location.  It was also expensive, but this is NY, so I would say it was still reasonable for the quality offered.;4
"We were in town for a meeting at the hotel so stayed the night.  First thing - be aware, that a Queen size bed is NY is not the same as a queen size bed anywhere else. We had a queen bed in the small room that was more like a double than a queen. Second - the rooms are small, and you can hear the noises from everyone else coming and going in the hall way.  We did try calling the front desk for extra pillows and got a message to leave a voice mail than they would get back to us within 24 hours.  Also, as we checked in we asked where the meeting was going to be held; the Hotel Manager said he would check and never came back out to tell us; so I asked the lady who was checking us in who was able to help.  Overall, a convenient hotel, but nothing very special.";3
We stayed as a family of 4 for 5 nights in April. The hotel is very central to everything. There is a sub way station literally next to it and it is in touching distance of Maddison Square garden. Rooms were very clean and nicely decorated. They were a bit on the small side but you are hardly in them. I would definitely stay there again. If you are only thinking about staying a few days think again. We could easily filled 10 days.;5
We loved spending our time in NYC at the New Yorker.  Traveling from Texas my daughter, husband, and I were ready for the elegant clean atmosphere of The New Yorker.  We immediately loved the Art Deco  design and the history behind the hotel. The lady checking us in did a great job of making us feel welcome and taking care of our needs in a room.  Then she handed us over to John at the concierge desk.  He was very informative and polite.  He did a great job of helping us to see what we wanted to in two days.  John always remembered our face and gave us a warm smile!  The housekeeping ladies were so sweet and warm.  Thank you New Yorker for a great stay!;5
Hubby and I stayed for 2 nights on trip down the East coast US riding Amtrak trains. Chose this hotel based on it's proximity to Penn Station (literally 200 yards) and it's Art Deco credentials - a style I really enjoy. The price was really good too. Our stay was a good example of how using Trip Advisor can really help you make the most of your stay and keep your expectations real. Through the TA community I arrived at the hotel aware of the service charge, the size of the rooms and the amenities I could expect. I entered the lobby, therefore, relaxed and ready to accept whatever came my way- after all - we weren't planning on spending too much time in our room. I have to say the hotel far exceeded our expectations. There was a slight queue at check in but staff were working;5
I have to thank Neida for making this whole thing work!  Our room was on the corner of 8th and 34th with a gorgeous view of the Empire State Building!!  It was clean and well-appointed. Across from Penn Station and a half block from Madison Square Garden, this location is great to travel throughout Manhattan.  The check-in and out was easy, the staff was friendly and helpful. Parking garages dot the area or you can have a valet park your vehicle for $60 or so for each 24 hr. period. Wish we had the time to visit the museum of the hotel...many famous people have stayed, played or performed there!  The hotel offers a diner, a kiosk that offers muffins, pastry, etc., and a restaurant with a bar for those that don't want to venture out after a day of touring. Absolutely no;5
We visited New York for the new year with my wife and we decided to try the New Yorker as there a very good deal on expedia The Hotel is Ok and relatively well located in Manhattan. Check in was smooth but not really warm. Rooms are very small even as per NYC standard. We stayed in one of the refurbished rooms which nice. Overall OK but certainly better options around Manhattan;3
"My two teens and I stayed at this hotel last week.  I'll start by saying that the staff is friendly and helpful, there is security at the elevators (you must show a room key to get past them); the room itself (a double) was roomy considering rooms in New York are tiny, Penn Station is right across the street.  The beds are comfortable and clean.  Our first room was facing the front of the hotel which was a bit noisy. We were moved to a higher floor with a room facing the Hudson River, which was much quieter.  The upgrade was free since we were asked to move. The cons are that the bathrooms are tiny.  The bathtub was peeling and there is only a narrow shelf above the pedestal sink where you can put your stuff -- and if anything falls off the shelf, it could land in the toilet.";3
We arrived at 1pm, the check inn was fast flowed nicely. We got to our room opened the curtains and we were greeted with a wall, I had specifically booked a room with a view, I went back down stairs spoke to the receptionist who had given our room, and she actually argued with me and didn't believe me that we had a brick wall as a view, I really wasn't impressed. After waiting an hour yes an hour she finally believed me and gave me another room that was before she checked it her self literally couldn't believe it. The rooms are so so small it's very cramped, the photos need to be changed on the website very misleading. No facilities no kettle or fridge very annoying. The beds are super comfy. The bath was awful once you got in the water disappeared so kept the tap on.  Tick tock;3
My overall impression is that this hotel was just okay, and perhaps a bit disappointing. I was hoping for a little more special experience given the price of the rooms and 4-star rating. My mom and I stayed here for a week, and my friend joined us for a portion of those nights. The location is extremely convenient--near Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Port Authority, Duane Reade and CVS, Macy’s, Times Square and many food options--Tick Tock Diner (24 hours) in the corner of the hotel, fast food options across the street, healthier options a block or 2 further, and convenience stores with fresh fruit and salad/hot buffets as well. Preferring healthy food, I found a vegan restaurant (Cinnamon Snail) in the Pennsy food court at Madison Square Garden about 3 blocks away. The;4
Location is great. I love that the Tickety Tock diner in the hotel is open 24/7. The rooms are clean but very small. I've stayed here several times and the line to check in and leave or pick up luggage seems to always be long. No real complaints but I wouldn't rave about anything here other than the convenient location.;3
I visited NYC June 4th-7th. The hotel was clean. But the rooms were very small. The pictures on the website show updated pictures and bigger rooms. But that is not the case. Also, this hotel charges you to keep your bags with the bell person if you need them to keep after you check-out. The bathroom is very small as well. The hotel is in a great location. Walking distance to many thing if you are willing to explore. My only complaint would be the room size and the false pictures prior to arriving.;3
This hotel was associated the the 2016 New York stamp show.  It had special room rates for show members which were very reasonable for NY  The room was comfortable but small for 2 people. Service is good as a request for a small fridge was met in under an hour  There are 2 restaurants in the hotel--The Tick Tock diner- very good food at very reasonable prices, especially for NY  The 2nd is an Italian restsurant Trattoria Bianca you should stay out of. We went in and ordered drinks and an appetizer to start. The drinks were small and weak and the appetizer tasteless and small.  Service was also very poor   All in all our stay at the hotel was above our expectations for NY;4
Checked into the hotel with a little trepidation having read some of the reviews mostly citing how small the rooms were check in went smoothly and we were given room 2222  on the 22nd floor opened  the door to find a very large spacious room with a view right onto the empire state building and below was maddison square gdn room was very clean and comfortable our friends had a similar room but a different view hotel was a great location for all the sights easy to get a cab to all locations penn st station just across the Rd  next to maddison which we used to go back to long island would definitely go back to the same hotel very friendly staff no problems at tall;4
New Yorker Hotel with originally over 2500 rooms was opened in 1930 and is located right in 34th street where the famous Empire State Building is also located!!! Over the years many famous personalities like  John F Kennedy and the legendary Mohammed Ali etc stayed here. The hotel is located just opposite Penn metro station and very near to the famous Time Square, However the room size has to be compromised. Further complimentary breakfast is not provided in the Hotel.;5
My husband and i stayed here for 5 nights from June 8th. The location is fantastic. Close to Penn Station, a few blocks from Macys. The room was perfect with a view over Hudson river. It was small but very clean and was perfect for us. The shower was fantastic a real power shower. The staff were very friendly and i think it was Miguel who checked us in. What a lovely guy. I certainly would not eat at the Tick Tock diner, it was awful. The only negative in the Hotel. I would stay there again;5
My girlfriend and I ended up at the Wyndham New Yorker by accident, we're from Jersey and were looking for a romantic weekend in NJ and we stumbled across their website. Since we spend almost every weekend exploring NYC night life it seemed logical to stay there for a change and don't have to drive back to NJ after so we could relax a while longer. My first impression of the hotel was the location, one block from the Empire State building, one block from Madison Square Garden and very centric all around, right in the heart of this amazing city. As we arrived, we were greeted by Mr Driss, a remarkable gentleman at the front desk that was very helpful and very professional, we knew then we arrived at the right place, he even recommended Swing 46, an awesome Jazz lounge with live;5
We paid £150 each between 3 of us for 3nights which from what I can gather is normal NYC prices! The location couldn't get any more central to so many things! There is a subway literally under the hotel if you need to get anywhere not within walking distance and we also used the air train from Newark to penn station which took just 20mins. The room itself was extremely small and the beds didn't seem normal size either. For the amount of time we spent in the hotel none of this mattered. Didn't ever use the bar or diner as there's so many restaurants nearby. We arrived on an early morning uk flight and got into the hotel about 2 and the room was ready which meant we could freshen up before we headed out!;3
My husband & I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel for two nights & enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in walking distance to Penn Station & MSG. If you are coming to NYC to see a show at the Garden, definitely stay here. From the minute we walked into the lobby, we were greeted by Mohammed at the guest services desk. He checked us in, asked us our room level preference & called up to the room before we settled in to make sure we were satisfied with the room. The hotel is clean, reasonable & quiet with friendly staff. You felt secure when going to the elevators to the rooms because security made you show your key.  The room was very clean & comfortable. The location is close to the High Line & Broadway as well. We will definitely stay at the Wyndham New Yorker again in the future.;4
I really liked this hotel, some bits of it could have benefited from a little modernisation, but it was clean and let's face it, when you're in New York the hotel is just somewhere to sleep.   The staff were really friendly, and the concierge was amazing, she founds us some reasonable tickets to Phantom of the Opera.    The only two grumbled I had, was the shower had a mind of its own, one minute freezing, the next scolding hot.  Which made for an interesting, and entertaining for my traveling companion shower.   The second is the additional $25 per day resort fee.  This did not feel good value for money, and just bumped the price up.  My own fault for not reading the small print I guess  That said, I still really enjoyed my stay, and it was really handy location wise so going;4
"Clean, in a great location. Small room with a ""Queen size bed"", much smaller than typical, closet sized bathroom.  Having stayed at other  NYC hotels, will not be coming back to this one. I was here for a conference.";3
Great location in midtown - easy access to subway and all areas of manhattan.  Very secure - room price very reasonable for a suite.  Complimentary water and soda, unheard of! Lovely staff - ready to answer questions any time.;5
We were surprised buy the tiny tiny size of the room.  I also missed not having a coffee service in the room.  We were frustrated that there were so few ice machines on such a big property and many were not working.;4
Great location, nice clean, HUGE for NYC, recently updated room.  Great, friendly and efficient staff, secure building, really a tremendous value.  Access to valet upon check in can be a little tricky but the valet staff were wonderful!  We would highly recommend!;5
Check in staff was very accommodating with early check in and security was better than expected.   Great location and the room was clean and nice size. Bed was comfortable. I would recommend this hotel   Very helpful staff.;4
"If you like a hotel with the look and feel of old New York and are drawn to places with a rich history then this is the hotel for you. The pros: Great location if you are attending an event at Madison Square Garden, lots of good dining options available within walking distance, the staff was friendly, room was clean and the bed comfortable, quick, easy check in. The cons: I had to pay a mandatory $30 ""facility fee"" to use services I had no use for. Don't know if this customary with all NYC hotels but it totally sucked. I had already overpaid for the room as it was... it's a little dated. The bath tub was old and it took forever for the hot water to kick in for my shower, I paid WAY too much for this hotel thanks to Hotels.com. I will never ever ever book with them again. Never.";4
"This is, I think a good hotel for people who maybe are in NYC regularly or are on their 3rd or 4th trip. It's not as ""in the middle of everything"" as some of the options nearer to Times Square but it's WAY more affordable. The get around, you're on the 8th Avenue line (and fairly near the 7th Ave) out of Penn Station which is A, C, and E trains. So you're going to have to connect at different stations to get a lot of other trains. Fine for us, we always use the subway when we're visiting but I feel like if it's you're first time or you have little kids, it may be a little overwhelming to have to get into Columbus Circle or Grand Central or Times Square stations to get anywhere. I don't care AT ALL about a hotel's decor but there are several questions about it on the review so,";4
The hotel was perfect location in the midst of midtown Manhattan. Easily accessible by all forms of transportation. This trip was a surprise proposal for my girlfriend. She loved that we were staying there. The staff was courteous and helpful. My own complaints are that the bathroom needs major updating. I know it's an older hotel and that's part of the charm but the bathroom looked like it was from a post WWII walk up apartment. I wished we could have checked in a bit earlier since our flight arrived at 9:45 am. We couldn't get our room until after 3:00pm. All in all a great trip and very memorable.;4
The room was clean though small. The hotel was fairly busy and this made it quite noisy at night. Although the hotel has obviously been renovated and updated, it feels basic rather than anything special, which is a real shame since it obviously has potential as a glimpse into a bygone age. The lobby is probably the most impressive feature. We did object strongly to the additional tax we were expected to pay, especially since our travel agent had assured us that there would be no 'extra' payment at checkout. We made such a fuss that they actually waived the payment - so perhaps if all travellers made the same objection this pernicious practice would end.  Overall, our experience was satisfactory, but nothing we could wax lyrical about. The hotel was rather impersonal and;3
Great location, very close to Madison Square Garden and the subway stations.  Tick Tock diner also great, good dinner and breakfast.  Rooms dated, but wifi was free on floor 8 and worked well enough for leisure. TV was decent too, room was very clean but carpets and bathroom a bit dated. No complaints, central location and good hotel for a reasonable price.;4
Let me preface this by saying that I've stayed at the New Yorker before and had a great experience. This time, however, I was disappointed. I had two separate reservations, one booked using reward points, that I subsequently upgraded to ensure that my room included a view and some of the other perks that were offered. My second reservation was booked through Club Wyndham, four days and three nights in the City. When I checked in, the desk clerk mentioned that I did have two reservations, but she was going to work backward. What I ended up with, was a shoebox of a room without a view, coffee maker or refrigerator - so my upgrade was null and void.   I did appreciate the security at the hotel and that guests are required to show a room key before heading to the elevators. Bell;3
I traveled into NYC for business through Penn Station and this hotel was a perfect location for that trip. it is just across the street from Penn station and has a subway entry just outside the hotel. The rooms were very old with multiple layers of paint obvious. My room had peeling paint on the shower tiles. The beds we just okay, more firm than I like. There was no refrigerator in the room nor vending or ice on my floor. I did have a beautiful of the Empire State building. If you spend a lot of time in the room this may not be the hotel for you. I was in the room to change clothes, shower, and sleep, so it served my purpose well.;3
Our family of 4 stayed in the New Yorker Hotel in June of 2016. First, the Good:  the lobby photo is accurate. The revolving door, lobby and staff help to transport the guest to the nostalgic 30's, 40's & 50's. The hotel is located near Madison Square Garden/Penn Station, subway access, 2 blocks from Macy's legendary department store, from our room the Empire State Bldg was clearly visible, beds were comfortable, temp control was good, cleaning staff were mostly invisible but very good. Relatively close to Time Square.  All of these things made the stay pleasant. The Bad:  Being from the mid-west, the value of the room-to-cost was not a plus. We paid ~$220/night through Expedia, this room in the mid-west would likely be half that. But it is New York. The bathrooms left something;3
Nice and very well located hotel recently renovated. Rooms a little small and the bathroom even smaller and the daily room service was a little poor but overall a place I would stay again. Right in the heart of mid town Manhattan. 34 Penn street station right next it so direct from airport way better than Catching a cab or shuttle. The staff were nice and friendly and helpful. They sell tickets for the bus to woodland common which is useful. Wi-Fi was decent speed. Remember there is an addition $30 per day charges which are compulsory.;4
"old out dated, dirty bathrooms. No view of Empire State building, even though we paid extra for a ""metro view"" to have the view.";2
"This is a busy, noisy hotel located just across the street from Penn St and Madison Sq Garden.  Thus, a little random at night --lots of homeless and mentally unstable people all over the place, esp. at night.  But you are very close to every subway (A,C,E, right at your corner; 1,2.3, one block up 34th; B,D,J,Z, Q, R, N another block up). Macy's et al right at your doorstep.  GREAT location comes with crowds.  Must factor that in. You'll have to show your room key to get into elevators.  Now, the rooms are nicely sized (bathroom is TINY), but I would have been happier if 1) there was a hot pot in the room to make tea and 2) real glasses were used. The hotel tries to give the impression of 30's glitz, but gives you ""disposable"" grit instead (individually wrapped plastic cups in";3
On arrival we were presented with a facilities bill for $88 + 8.5% tax. Receptionist advised that this was for use of Hi Fi, Gym, Free telephone calls. I advised  that at 70yrs of age neither myself or wife would be using Gym nor Wi Fi nor making any telephone calls. She said she could not waive the fee but she could reduce reduce it to $44 + Tax which I consider a rip off! Never had a hotel charge for these facilities before not even Hilton Paddington or Thistle Group etc. I notice this has been raised in other reviews and still Wyndham still persist in this fee. Otherwise the hotel is excellent for the costs. It is central to most attractions etc. The rooms are spotless - our bathroom appears to have been renovated over the last few years. The hotel decor is Art Deco in line;4
Well I have just returned from a whistle stop tour of New York using this hotel as a based or the trip after being recommended it by a family friend.   If you like hotels that still have the same character as when it was opened then this is a great hotel. The lobby hasn't changed that much it seems, looking at the photos of the hotel downstairs by the restrooms in the hotel.   The room sizes are a little on the small side but they are functional and clean and comfortable. And let's face it, if you are visiting NY like I was on a site seeing tour, we were out the rooms but 8AM. And didn't return till 9PM at night. It's just a place to rest up and recharge to do it all again the next day. One thing, make sure you ask for a coffee machine, it does tea As well as long as you don't;4
The room was too small for my taste. In addition, the room did not have a refrigerator. Most of the employees were professional.;2
Our 20 hours long flight paid-off with sincere greetings from the staffs, comfort accomodation, nice city view from the room and the most essential is its great location.  It is a block away from the shopping center (macy`s, gap, H&M, Bloomingdale, etc) and near T-Mobile store.   it`s just across McD and Starbucks that open early in the morning to have some breakfast, and across the 24 hr VCS pharmacy and convenient center.  it`s just across the bus station to Woodburry premium outlet, and walking distance to Greyhound terminal. it is also walking distance to the Broadway. Metro station also can be found behind the hotel area.;5
"Why is there a facility fee aka resort fee for what use to be called amenities? We were charged $31.57 for each night's stay at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel. We were informed the fee was for the fitness room, wifi, and unlimited use of the in room phone. Weren't these called amenities a few years ago? People use to book a room based on what the facility had to offer or not offer therefore each facility would try to offer services that possible guests would like. Now like the airlines, hotels are adding fees for services that were standard - i.e. an in room phone for an emergency or for an order of room service. I wonder why is this even part of the nightly rental? Why doesn't the hotel just increase the room per night rental rather than add this ""resort"" fee?  Wyndham New Yorker";2
Clean hotel, room was lovely, beds comfy, reasonably quite room could hear a few sirens ect.  Staff really good. Brilliant central location.  The diner is great not too expensive. Bar is nice for a chilled out evening drink.  Would stay here again. Room was large.;5
"Just got back from a 5 night mad trip to New York. We knew not to expect much sleep and really only thought the hotel would be an occasional snooze and shower base. As it turned out the room was an absolute high point of our trip. Other reviews had mentioned asking for a room on upper floors (over 30th) if you want a little less traffic noise.so I opted for a Metro View Room Queen which averaged about $200/night before taxes, etc. Anyway, at check in the lady just smiled and said ""Enjoy the view"". Well, on entering room 3621 and pulling back net curtains we were just blown away. Any view from 36 floors up in New York will be pretty amazing - but our view was straight up 34th street and filling our window was the Empire State building! This scenery went to a whole level again at";5
Chose this hotel due to location and price was reasonable. I stayed in an suite, room was clean and ok size for 4 people. Bathroom really needed an upgrade.  However, the front desk and management really let down my stay. We arrived from a very long flight to the front desk telling us our room had been cancelled and really that was it! Asked to speak to management and they said no its not cancelled but the payment was declined even thought I prepaid! After a very long discussion I gave them another card until I could call my bank and see what happened. Hotel offered us a better room but in fact it was the room I booked.  I have been contacting the hotel on this since I got back and they have not got back to me once. I booked via booking.com and they have been contacting/email;2
Great time spent here. Fantastic rooms we had a lovely view, hotel has wifi too!!Staff very friendly n helpful booked us a Taxi to the Airport! Looking forward to our next trip!!! There is a restaurant in the hotel too lovely food 👌well worth a visit!!!!!;5
Decent hotel in very good location, walking distance of most of tourist spots. Hotel is clean and attached Tick Tock restaurant is reasonable value, especially for breakfast. The gratuies however are ,as in all America, eye watering. The waitress even had the cheek to cross our the suggested 18%, yes 18%, and ring the 21%. She didn't get it!!!  We had a room with a view of the Empire State Building, reasonable size and clean. The main objection with this hotel was at check out when the taxes and gratuities and fee for use of amenities, it matters not if you don't use them you still pay.  While taxes etc are beyond the control of the hotel the TOTAL cost of stay should be given at time of request.  Make sure you get the final total and not a surprise on check out Having said all;3
After 11 nights in Orlando, we stayed here for 3 nights at the start of June. We selected the hotel as a suite could accommodate a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children) and the location couldn't be more central for Manhattan. We were provided with a complimentary upgrade by Mohammed (thank you) and were located on the 39th floor of 40 with amazing views of the Empire State, Chrysler and Madison Square Gardens.  The suite was purely a base to sleep between sightseeing however I could go to sleep and wake up to that view every day! The room was clean and well serviced.  The exterior may be undergoing renovation but the hotel has a history and character that it's Art Deco style portrays. After one exhausting day, we grabbed a bite to eat at the Tick Tock diner and found the quality of;5
We arrived at 3:30 but no room available till at least 4:30, when check in states from 2pm. Suzie from the concierge was very helpful!   Our room was 2939, on the 29th floor. There was building work and scaffolding outside both our windows. Building work started around 8am every morning, loud banging and noises. The room was extremely small. The bathroom was outdated and small. The room was mostly clean, the maid came in everyday and changed towels and bedding every 3 days. No replenishment of toiletries was left.   The hairdryer broke in the room therefore I walked down to reception (with wet hair) after trying to ring 4 times but with no answer. They apologised and said they would send another one up..... 60 minutes later I went back down to reception asking where my hairdryer;3
Our room was amazing.  Had a great view with lots of room.  Safe was a plus.  We were within walking distance of Times Square.  Staff was wonderful- very helpful whenever we had a question. Lobby was very inviting with seating for a group to sit around and visit.;5
While the Hotel may be old in appearance it is very clean and we got an excellent service. It is in a great location for shoppers. just 8 blocks from port authority and local shopping is walking distance and Subway on the corner of the hotel brought us down to World trade centre.. Empire State building just a few blocks away also.;5
Every time I'm in NYC I have stayed here, aside from my first visit- the place keeps me coming back!  I arrived really early in the morning, checked in with the front desk, and checked my luggage. I have to admit, being a soon to be checked in guest, I was glad not to be charged to check my bags until my room was ready. The clerk at the front desk took my info and credit card (Room was a pre-paid reservation, aside from taxes and incidentals) and told me to come back sometime between 2 and 3:30. I expressed my preference for a room with a city view (as opposed to Hudson River), and she said she would see what she could do.   I came back later that afternoon and had a short wait after checking back in with the front desk. I was assigned room 2535. I have to admit, there were;5
I wound up at Wyndham New Yorker using Priceline name your own price for second time in just over a year and am astounded that they are afforded four stars in the hotel rankings. The rooms and bathrooms are so small (even by New York standards), the furniture so clumsy and outdated, it just doesn't make sense to me, and I have stayed in numerous NYC hotels of that ranking.  The location is very good (directly across from Penn Station) and I have no problem with the service or the people who work there.   Because I feared getting a postage-stamp room, I called a day before check-in and talked with an extremely pleasant manager, requesting a paid or complimentary upgrade to a larger room. I was told the hotel was sold out but they would do what they could. At check-in the;2
Nice hotel but could do with being painted staff   need be a bit .more helpful  asked for a kettle for my room but got a coffee machine instead after a day run out of pods for the machine so asked at the front desk girl that worked there said she would send someone up to how room but had to wait four hours later still no coffee pods so I was a little mad by now so I complained and. Got them at last;3
We enjoyed the room and the view. We spent three nights and did not have the sheets changed in order to be a little more environmentally friendly. That being said we were a little surprised that the drinking glasses in the room were plastic wrapped in plastic. Seems like a lot of extra waste.;4
Great location, great hotel - if the room air conditioning system had worked, it would have been a great stay.;4
Wonderful hotel in midtown, great for Macy's and quick ten minute walk uptown to Times Square or Empire State Building five mins away. Krystal was so kind to me as I was travelling alone with my two year old infant, she organised a room in a refurbished room for me as I was worried about infant allergies and old carpet etc. What a beautiful hotel with great amenities and staff. The New Yorker truly made my week travelling in New York with a baby a breeze- I can't say enough thank you's and especially to Krystal on the front desk, she is so professional and kind, we felt very looked after. Will be back to the Wyndham.;5
"This was our first visit to NYC the hotel is well located for tourist attractions and transport. Within walking distance from MSG, Times Square, Macy's, Penn Station, ESB and Port Authority. We flew into Newark and didn't bother with a taxi it was cheaper and quicker to get the train to Penn Station 5 min walk by London standards.  Yes, the room is small but clean and functional. The staff at reception were friendly and helpful. We tried the Tik Tok diner and the hotel bar, breakfast was fine but nothing special and bar overpriced.  My only issues; facility fee, who charges for Wifi and why plastic shower curtains!";4
I was fortunate and managed to snag a great rate, but ultimately decided to stay here due to the history of the hotel. If you are unfamiliar, definitely recommend looking it up.   The hotel is currently undergoing construction on the exterior, I believe, which made it a little difficult to determine where to go for valet. The staff is very attentive, specifically the doormen. They were amazing.   The rooms have been upgraded, but the original tile in the shower and the toilet (think public restroom) have seen better days. I had an AMAZING view overlooking MSG, talk about luck!   The pet fee is very reasonable ($25/night). Valet is $60/night. No room service, but two restaurants off the lobby.   Overall, I had a really great stay- can't complain. Near to the Empire State Building;4
Was a bit disappointed with the hotel, it is a nice retro style hotel but room was quite small really, bigger downside was the complete lack of basics in the room, not kettle to be able to make drinks in the morning, you either had to pay for expensive hotel coffee or go out and get coffee from cafes close by, also had an issue with the Wifi use when they tried charging almost $50 for use as when logging on is not very clear on the free version and the pay version.  Having said all this the hotel is in a good location, I would use it again if the price was right. Madison Square Garden is on the doorstep of the hotel and Times square just a 15 min ish walk away.;3
The reason we picked this hotel was mainly for the location, it was so close to everything we needed - we were able to walk to the Empire State Building from here, and with a subway station right outside the door, it was just perfect! The staff at the check in desk were so helpful and accommodating. The room was absolutely beautiful and much bigger than we expected! Only downside would be the view as the window looked out to an alleyway however, we were out all day every day so it didn't impact us much!;5
It was a fantastic weekend all around. It was my 11 year old cousins first time to the city and her birthday present from me. The hotel was amazing and the staff was nothing short of fantastic. I had Called and asked for a good view and I had a view of the Empire State Building. The room was very clean and well kept throughout our stay. And some places take the extra blanket away after the first night it was used, but this place folded it neatly and kept it on the bed, which was very much appreciated, cause I did not have to ask for another. The concierge was very friendly and super helpful, even gave us pointers on the subway. It was walkable from the train station and subway stops, and Times Square. It was also very close to Broadway which was a bonus cause we had tickets to;5
The New Yorker has a perfect location if you are arriving in Manhattan by train. A subway station is also right around the corner. The hotel is in a busier area of the city, but it was relatively quiet in my room on the 33rd floor. The hotel has an interesting history which is written about and included in the hotel information folder in the room and parts of it are also on display in the lower level area accessible by the escalators.  My room was very small, but it was perfect for me (travelling alone). The room was also clean. I appreciate that there was an employee checking for room cards just prior to the elevators. It helped me to feel safer.;4
I booked last minute through a discount site after other plans fell apart. The New Yorker offers easy access to Penn Station, Madison Garden, Macys and tons of great restaurants. The property is best for families, groups, International travelers and couples on a budget stay. Hipsters and party seekers might choose something else as this property has a strict no-smoking policy (including vape pens). Housekeeping was very nice, attentive and the hotel was clean. I would stay again if seeking a quick stay in the city.;3
We stayed in The New Yorker in July 2015 and was suprised by the old hotel. It was well looked after and it was great to read and see of the history of the hotel. The location was great as it was right next to MSG and an easy walk to most places. The sunset views were amazing looking towards the HighLine. The service was excellent;4
Excellent locarion being on 34th. Very close to all 3 major subway lines to quickly get anywhere. 2 restaraunts on site. Very nice staff. Excellent concierge service for directions, etc.  Clean hotel.  Security near the elevators to make sure guests with keys are only people getting on elevators. I would definately stay here again.;5
May 2016. We have just returned from the Wyndham New Yorker in central Manhattan, New York. Built in the 1920's, 4* multi storey hotel in a brilliant location, (8th ave / 34th street) across the road from Penn Station. Down the road from Empire State Building and Times Square, near Macy's, Brilliant location for seeing the sights. We stayed 3 nights in a sunny room on the 25th floor with views of the Empire State Building. Average 4* well maintained room with queen size comfortable bed, large flat screen television, safe, small ensuite, good shower, complimentary toiletries. Fresh towels and daily maid service. No tea / coffee making facilities which I would have liked. Not noisy on 25th floor, quiet air con. Free wifi in rooms. Nice impressive reception / foyer area with marble;4
I stayed here because of the convenience to Javitts Convention Center and Pennsylvania train station.  Javitts was a 3 block walk away and the train station was a short walk.  It was easy to to use NJ transit to transfer to and from Newark Airport. Upon arrival, we got an free upgrade to a Queen suite from a standard Queen room because i was a Wyndham Rewards menber.  The room was spacious for a New York Hotel and had a fridge and safe which were very useful.  The room appeared to have been recently renovated and was nice.  The view out the window was to the interior of the building but I didn't have a problem with this because the room was quiet at night.  An outside view room overlooking the street would have been noisy in this part of the city.  The staff was friendly and;4
"Enjoyed staying at this hotel for 5-day trip. It was clean, convenient, and comfortable. Pros: GREAT location near Times Square, Broadway, restaurants, and major subway lines; beautiful, historic decor. Cons: small rooms (but keep in mind it's NYC...), no views.";5
"i staid here one night to check out the mid town area. The receotion staff was not friendly and ""forgor"" to tell me that the extra services (Internet and Gym) would cost another 29 dollars extra. The room was tiny and old and tired.this place is more a tourist trap than a decent Hotel.";2
We had a good stay overall but were disappointed with the size of the room which was quite small and the bed which had a sag in the middle. The real kicker was the large roach we found in the shower on our last day. Definitely disappointing. I informed the front desk as we checked out and was told they would have the room treated.;3
I loved staying at the Wyndham it sits in a area where u can walk to different attractions there's a cvs that's 24 hours right across the street that's so convenient  plus there's different restaurant that's on the same street.;5
Great location to explore New York from.We stayed for 5 nights last July and found our room  spacious with two queen sized beds and two bathrooms..very comfortable and spotlessly clean.The staff were friendly and helpful and check in and out was seamless although quite busy.My husband especially enjoyed chatting with Mike in the lobby.We are very much looking forward to staying there again this July.😀;5
This historic hotel a block away from Penn Station has long been a staple of New York. However it did decline and I remember it as a bit of a dump. However it's been wonderfully restored. It's updated with keeping its historic and New York deco feel to it.  It's a great location if you have an early train, a hop, skip and a jump to Penn Station!  Also across the street from Madison Square Gardens.  The lobby is it's former grand Art Deco style. You know you're in New York! There is a classic New York deli off the lobby. The staff was friendly and courteous.  My room was clean, okay in size and a redone modern bathroom. The Wifi is free. My view was of Madison Square Gardens and so great deco decor on the building.    Great location, historic charm and friendly staff make this;5
As many reviews will point out, this hotel is perfectly oriented in NYC. The subway station nearby is an express stop, so you can always find your way home. It's walk-able distance to Times Square, & 42nd street, which is awesome. The hotel room itself was average, nothing fancy. We weren't able to upgrade to a room with a view (due to unavailability the guy said) but our hotel room served its purpose nonetheless. We didn't spend that much time in the room anyway, as we were busy exploring New York City. The staff was generally amiable, except the one man at the counter who gave us the wrong room key and didn't seem to care much about us as guests--such an aloof aura. He was unfortunately the first person we dealt with which could have set up a bad tone for the hotel, but;4
As a huge Nikola Tesla fan, I was first drawn to the hotel because of him.  However, I quickly fell in love with the hotel! This is my second year staying here, and I can't even imagine staying anywhere else for my annual trips to NYC. Convenient location, friendly and helpful staff, and tons of history. I will say that we stayed in a suite this year, rather than a regular room, and the extra space made a huge difference.;5
It's 12:30 am and there is a jackhammer outside our window. Hotel will not move us to another room, told us to just live with it. Worst customer service ever. The city may never sleep but we need to. Never felt less valued as a customer than when talking to the front desk manager about the noise.;1
Nice place with some interesting history.  (Tesla lived here) There is also a 24-hour diner connected to it. Room was clean and had a nice view. Staff was very friendly and very helpful. This is one neat Hotel.;5
We've stayed here a second time visiting Manhattan and nothing beats the location. The rooms are tiny however you don't spend your stay in NYC couped up in your room so the size is acceptable. Be warned being in this location brings noise throughout the night even on the 25th floor. Sirens, garbage trucks, homeless people, cars etc etc echoes throughout the night so bring ear plugs. Beds are really comfortable. The service is top notch. The vicinity to almost everything is a short walk, shopping, bars, redtaurants, pharmacy, subway etc etc.;4
I was very impressed with how quickly we were checked in by the friendly front desk/ reception staff ,the hotel lobby is big but has an Art Deco old world feel with lots of character . The location is very good with plenty of transport links , penn station not being too far away and of course plenty of taxis ,buses and nearby subway stations. Good security  at the hotel ,you have to show your room key before you can enter the lift/ elevator area . My room was small ,but in my opinion, cosy and not overlooking the Main Street which made things  better in terms of street noise  The room was equipped with an iron and board , hair dryer , but no kettle or coffee machine and no fridge ,it had a safe . No power points near the bed  , two sockets on the wall opposite the bed which was;4
I truly enjoyed my stay at the Wyndham New Yorker. It is a charming old world hotel in transition to it's former glory days. I can't wait for the transformation to be complete, but to be completely satisfied, you must upgrade your room to one that has been newly renovated. I had friends stay on other floors, and it really is a world of difference, so I understand the mixed reviews here.  Again, you can't beat the location...close to Herald and Time's Square, across the street from Penn Station, and there are several coffee/pizza/gift/drugstore places all withing walking distance. The Tic Tock Diner is 24 hours, and the food is as decent as it gets in Manhattan.  I would not hesitate to come again, and look forward to it!;4
The hotel met all my needs as well as my budget. Lovely and clean. Helpful, friendly staff. Nice to have a 24 hr diner on site.;5
This is a historic hotel (Tesla used to live here), but the age shows in the rooms. Our room was spacious, very quiet (23d floor), efficient and quiet AC, comfortable bed, but otherwise bare bones. Even no coffee maker. The location is convenient to many places. The price seems competitive for Manhattan. I'd like to specifically mention the courtesy and friendliness of all personnel. When we arrived, there was a mistake in reservation, and we had a room with one bed instead of two. I'd like to specifically  thank Miguel Estévez, who put lot of time and effort to fix the problem in fully booked hotel. The diner downstairs offers good breakfast and other meals throughout the day at very reasonable price.;4
I stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel one week 8-15 may 2016. We were 2 persons at holyday. I reserved it through Hotel.com to a fair price.   Unfortunately the price for internet at $ 27.50 per day came on top when I arrived to the hotel.  And it was not optional. It made me angry, and the price was no longer so fair. The location was good, in uptown part NY.  But the room was small and old, and with a dirty window - without a view. The hotel is built in 1930 an have a glory history, which describes in the basement, where there is a small exhibition. The entrance hall is all right - but the hotel rooms in general could use an innovative makeover. The hotel advertise with breakfast for 1 dollar… It is a gimmick.  There is a small desk in the hall, where they have some sort of;2
We were recommended this hotel for it's location & it didn't fail. Although the rooms were rather small & the bathroom a little tired the views completely made up for this. I requested a high floor & 36th was fab. A very busy retro hotel with good facilities. Tick Tock great for breakfast & a self serve takeaway for breakfast very handy for breakfast in bed!! Will definitely return!;4
"This hotel is a very nice hotel close to Times Square.  It's retro, big and busy!  We were a bit disappointed with our room as it was quite small and the view out both windows was brick buildings.  However, as we spent most of our time out and about, this wasn't a big problem.  Another thing we were disappointed with was the fact that on the day we were leaving, we got a bill pushed under the door charging us $22 per day for services!  We already paid our travel agency a load of money for this holiday and don't think we should be paying a service charge to hotel after we'd already paid for the accommodation.  When we questioned it at reception the response we got was that the service charge was for water, electricity and ""free wi-fi"" and most holiday resorts like Barbados etc";4
We had a wonderful stay in New Yorker  Wyndham. The rooms are clean the location is great. Would stay at this hotel again!!;5
I just wanted to send a note thanking you for the service and kindness of your team-John and Fernando. John helped me multiple times while I stayed at the New Yorker and went out of his way to take care of me. Fernando picked me up and dropped me off at the airport. He was friendly, safe and a huge help. I will stay at the New Yorker again just because of the service your team provided.;5
"Had a forgettable one night stay earlier this week. I selected the hotel for its proximity to Penn Station and its price. The location is ideal. The hotel itself is dated - the lobby area is very nice but the halls were dreary and tired-looking. My room (a std. queen) was tiny and very basic. I did not try either restaurant and did not use the meeting/ event space.  Two reasons for my ""poor"" rating. First, the hotel tacks on a $29/night facility fee that is not in the advertised rate, supposedly to cover wifi, the business center and fitness center - amenities that are free in many places and should be free everywhere. Second, the only amenity that I actually wanted to use was the business center, to print airline boarding passes - unfortunately the internet was 'down' that";2
Check in was easy and the staff very friendly on the check in desk and they sent a bottle of champagne up to our room as we were celebrating my partners birthday and she was very happy with this kind gesture.    It's a perfect location and in walking distance of all the top attractions anf shopping. Very clean hotel, rooms are maybe a little small for some people but it was fine for us.   After shopping and walking all day we just sunk into the beautiful big bed and never missed a winks sleep.   There's no room service but there is a nice dinner in the hotel that we would recommend if looking for a quick meal.   Just be aware there is an extra charge for facilities/resort fee athy they say is for wifi and for use of the telephone in your room which you can use to make outgoing;5
The Wyndham New Yorker was a great place to stay in New York. The warm welcome and buzzing lobby was all very impressive in this Art Deco hotel. On arrival we were allowed to check in early and were offered the option on a larger room with two bathrooms in one of their rooms with a very limited view. We decided on the inside room which turned out to be very quite and great escape from the horns and sirens of New York. The greatest feature of this hotel is the location. Penn Station is on your door step and if you are coming from JFK take the Airtrain to Jamaica and then the 'E' subway to Penn Station and you will be within a few Yards of the hotel. There are three Pen Station subways on 34th street so access to both uptown and downtown destinations are at your doorstep as is The;5
I have visited many hotels. Some with resort fees and some without. This hotel has absolutely no reason to charge a resort fee. There is no pool, no jacuzzi, no lobby amenities. They don't even think enough of their guest to provide a drink of water in the lobby, a bottle of water, or a water fountain. This hotel is a 3 star at best. The rooms are tiny! The bathrooms are dated and in need of updating. There is no vanity, therefore, there is no where to place anything in the bathroom. They charge $25 a night for a rollaway bed. Although, our check in person waved the fee. The entire hotel is dated. Most of the electrical plugs are hidden behind the beds.;3
Had a fantastic time in NYC, great location art deco hotel with a fantastic views of Downtown from a Midtown location. We had room 3706 which is still to be renovated but it has loads of old fittings, clean and tidy, and quiet. Too much to recommend to do but a couple of must do's are: The Rockafella (better view of Central Park and NYC with the Empire State in), Take the subway to Coney Island, Brooklyn and walk the High Line.;5
I am a wheelchair user with some complex medical needs so when travelling hotel choice can be extremely important.   This was our 9th time in New York and our 6th time to stay in this hotel. It is expensive but well worth it for the service and the experience you have.   Wheelchair accessible room was great. There was lots of space for me to get around, I wasn't just stuck in one corner. Bathroom had a roll in shower. Room was perfect really but what makes this hotel even better for us is the staff.   Downstairs, the Tick Tock Diner is not wheelchair accessible but once you inform them that you are there, they will serve in the bar on the opposite side of the lobby.  The food is lovely, as are the staff - especially my friend Mike, a fellow Lego fanatic.   Want to give a special;5
Have previously stayed at the New Yorker some years ago and was keen to stay again. It didn't disappoint - stayed for seven nights with my mum and had a wonderful room. It was spacious and had a lovely view of downtown New York. The WiFi was brilliant and air conditioning very welcome as temperatures soared during our visit. Excellent location as everything is easily accessible and impressed with security. Looking forward to staying again when next visiting NYC.;5
Stayed here whilst attending a course held in the hotel. Booked a room with a double bed for 5 nights. The lobby was functional but no longer grand for a destination like New York. The staff were efficient and very helpful but with a small reception counter, only 3 guests could be served at any one time.   The room was comfortable but cramped. The double bed was decent sized and the bathroom sufficient though there was a lack of shelving for basic toiletries like tooth paste and stuff. The corner room I was assigned had a very small wardrobe and I was only able to put in shirts obliquely. There was little space to place my luggage too.  As its an old hotel, even though the rooms were refurbished, the piping wasn't. I could here every toilet flush and shower usage from the two;3
We love the New Yorker! The hotel and the staff are awesome. Special thanks to Muhammed Husan and Driscoll Gatou for making our checking in so great. Their friendliness, smiles, helpfullness and accommodating spirits made our day. All of the staff was wonderful.;5
Good location near Pent Station,restaurants and shopping malls.There are many Halal carts around for quick take away foods. I requested for upgrade into a newly renovated room and was given a room at the 8th floor.The room was spacious but overlooked into an air well and directly facing opposite rooms windows so we have to keep the curtains closed all the time.The bathroom is very small and the wash hand basin is very shallow and water splashes everywhere.The biggest problem is the foul smell coming out from the ventilation system.There is an extra fee charged for internet and calls.So you need to make landline calls to make your money worth.We did not have time to do that because we were busy touring the city.Otherwise the hotel is okay.;3
My husband and I stayed one night because we were leaving on a week-long cruise the following day. We took Amtrak to Penn Station and pulled our luggage one block to the hotel. It is beautiful and grand. An old, historic hotel that has/is renovated and updated. Still has some scaffolding outside.  At check-in there was a line of people waiting and when it was our turn the young lady checked us in and gave us our key card pretty efficiently. We had a confirmation for a Metro Queen room. We did not realize until the next day that we had been given a different room than we had reserved. Turn out we were in an Executive Queen which is much smaller than a Metro Queen because it is meant for a business traveler who is likely traveling alone. When we got to the room we opened the door;4
Loved the view of the Empire State Building from our 35 floor room :) this hotel is steeped in history and has some beautiful Art Deco features. Room small but adequate. Was an excellent location for sights seeing, a few blocks from Empire State and Macy's, easy walking to Time Square too. Arrived on LIRR from JFK airport, easy and by far the quickest way to get to the hotel as Penn station is just around the corner. Don't forget to check out the independent restaurants on 9th Hells Kitchen.;4
I decided to return to the New Yorker hotel after staying here two weeks prior to my visit. It was selected at first because of its location, just a few blocks away from where I was working. I stayed in an executive queen room on the 39th floor (after I was given a double room by mistake), and it was spacious and had a spectacular view. I could see the Statue of Liberty from my room!   I did not use any of the facilities (fitness and business centers), but I did make a trip down to the bottom floor to see them. The fitness center seemed larger than your typical hotel fitness center.  The staff was friendly and accommodating. I felt safe in the neighborhood. It was a quick walk to meet friends around Times Square. Added bonus: the artists from Ink Master were staying at the same;5
In general terms the hotel is good. Especially in terms of price/location. However it feels some somehow dated.   It has some very specific points that may annoy some guests.   Hotel Amenity:  -Restaurant, it has two. Not what you would call inviting. One is like a cafeteria the other is more upper scale.  -Internet/Free WiFi, it gives free wifi to guests. Normal speed.  -Front Desk, not so good customer service. It took us 12 minutes to check in. A bit slow. You will notice. Sometimes you come out of your room and there is, I kid you not, a line formed by around 100 people.  -Smoke free hotel, Yes.   Hotel Room:  -Air Conditioning, a bit loud.  -Cleanliness, very good. However (BIG detail), everyday when we came back the room smells weird. It smells between cigar and coffee.  -;3
We have just returned from NY and spent 3 nights at the Wyndham. Room was small but fine for two adults and one 11 year old. It wasn't cheap but it was competitive for Manhatten. AC in room was fantastic. The hotel is very old and a little rough round the edges but it was clean and even encounter we had with every member of staff was excellent. Great location, would recommend.;4
The hotel foyer is very grand - but our room for three people was tiny - not enough space for cases let alone walking from the beds to the bathroom - very disappointed.  On two days the room was not cleaned - I emailed the hotel with pictures of the dust on the TV screen and units but had no acknowledgement.    Room keys had to redone by reception several times - this was infuriating as the reception staff was not very helpful and rather unpleasant.   Door men were very pleasant!  Internet charge was a scandal and really unreliable - made to pay for a service which never worked !!!!  The only good thing about the hotel was the location - great for getting round New York;3
"The room is quite big for the price, compared to other hotels in NY. The people working there is nice. Internet works fine.  The room was not noisy at all, which is great, and the AC works silently and well.  I took breakfast everyday from the stand they put in the lobby, not so much variation but acceptable.  When booking you have to be aware of the ""hotel fees"" like the extra price per day for the internet access and the fitness center access and this kind of things (so, without option but the WiFi is paid).  Overall, a better experience than other hotels I was previous in NY.";4
Very friendly staff at check in and out. Great security at the elevator banks to filter in and out on who should be there and not. Very historic hotel property since many celebrity guests and other famous people like Tesla lived in that hotel.;5
We stayed for 6 nights 4 adults and 2 children. It was fine the rooms weren't big but adequate. We were out all day and night only there to sleep so it was ideal. Great location. Staff friendly and very helpful. Walking distance to most everywhere. Would definitely stay again. The tick tock restaurant was good ideal for children and very reasonable.  Great security as well.;5
I travelled with a group of friends and stayed here 1st week in May. The location is perfect with the majority of places to visit within walking distance, a subway around the corner will take you to further places. Times Square, Macy's and Empire State Building just 5 minutes walk away.  Renovations have kept the art deco features and although to rooms were a little dated, they were clean and comfortable with a view of the Empire State Building from our room on the 34th floor. The Tick Tock diner had a breakfast to die for but expensive to eat there every day. We found many deli's and eating places close by and much cheaper.  The cart on the corner serves great bagles and coffee with a smile.  All the staff I dealt were very friendly, prompt and helpful. I would definitely stay;5
We stayed here as a base for our honeymoon in NY. We were not looking for luxury. However, it is very basic. When you enter, it is lovely and grand but the rooms are very very basic and the bathrooms are very out of date. We were on the 22nd floor. The shower took a good 10minutes to become hot so had to turn it on as soon as we got back. The closet continually smelt of cooking. There was a vent inside it and I am not sure if this came directly up from the diner below but we had to keep our clothes out of there and on the chair in the bedroom. The bed was comfy enough. The doors are heavy and so you hear them slamming at all hours. We had a very busy and loud floor! As a base it was fine but if you are looking for a bit more from a room, or a quiet hotel, then do not stay here.;3
The room was small but adequate (European style), clean.  Elevators were fast, never waited, even a minute.  The only negative was that there were no empty plugs for my ipad & iphone, only in the bathroom (thank goodness it didn't fall into the toilet), had to unplug lamp. Friendly staff.  I liked the noon check out as my flight was later.  My initial flight was early, 11A, and they were able to accommodate me with an early checkin (their check in is 3P), amazing. This hotel was rated a 4 star.  I would give it  a 3 1/2.   Great location, close to Penn Station and the Highline and many other attractions.;4
"Great hotel with super lacation just ""behind"" Madisoin Square Garden. Nice rooms (31st floor) with great view. Very friendly service at the front desk. A super Diner just at the corner. And a very efficient Consierge!";5
My daughter and I stayed at this hotel 5/11-5/15/2016. It has a great history and 30s ambiance in the lobby. That is where the fun ends. Our room was extremely small, there was no coffeemaker or refrigerator, and the bathroom sink was clogged.  There was no functional ice maker within several floors of our room. And the housekeeper knocked on our door before 9 AM every morning! Definitely not what I was expecting for over $250 a night.;3
Stayed here for our 6 day trip. Location of this hotel cannot be faulted. Ten minute walk from Times Sq, Empire State and just a couple of mins from subway station. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Lobby and bar area are beautiful. Rooms could do with updating but were kept clean and fresh all week. Couldn't fault the price. Best booking through Expedia. We got a great deal.;4
"I chose this hotel because it's very close to the Penn station and nice accessibility.  However, the front desk of this hotel disappointed me. Our stay was redemption with upgrade for an executive double room; she tried to charge additional for internet and amenities. I showed the confirmation then she said ""okay."" Moreover, we paid additional fees for the room but got only a regular double.  I asked her again ""it supposed to be an executive room located from the 19th floor and above, I believe?"" She replied ""no."" My mom was so tired and I just gave up.";1
Was put off when they charged 2 dollars a bag to hold your bags after checkout I never heard of such a thing.  Also the bathroom was very small;4
My stay here in May 2016 brought back memories of May1954 when my husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon, although there have been lots of changes.  I'm happy to see it still has the same welcoming features and is still called the New Yorker.;5
I wanted to buy some photographic items from B&H and it is close to this hotel.Although room facilities are minimal for short period of stay , location is good .Room space is not enough for two people .;3
When first getting to the hotel, I knew I was a few hours before checkin time but they pre checked me in to save time when checkin time actually came around. They then held my bags so I could begin exploring the city. After getting to my room we discovered the shower head was broken and spraying water all over. We spoke with a manager who was very nice and upgraded us to an executive room. The executive room was great! Much more room to move around, updated, and a view of the Empire State Building! We had a great time and all the staff we encountered were very nice and helpful.;5
Room:  We had a standard room.  It was small by US standards.  The hotel has been around a long time, so we were not surprised with the smaller size.  We were in NYC to sightsee, so the small room was OK.  But let’s be clear, we had very little elbow room. Location: Wonderful.  Short walk to basically everywhere including Time Square.  Also easy access to the subway.  Active area for cabs.  Biggest appeal of this place is the A+ location. Service: Busy hotel. Service felt a bit rushed. Bit the concierge was just delightful.  Full of good tips and help on several requests.   Price: Given the location the price we paid was a great deal.  Small room sure, but a good value.  If I’m back in NYC looking for budget lodgings, I’ll return.  But honestly, for a few dollars more there are;3
A classic Art Deco property close to all attractions, this hotel was quiet, cosy and warm for my last night in NYC after a trip around the country. The room was well-appointed, elegant and very clean. The bathroom was a bit small, and so I got the floor wet when showering, but the fittings were authentico Art Deco and the addition of a large closet was welcome. Downstairs the Tick Tock Diner was good to revisit and experience some classic American diner food. The check-in staff were very friendly, and I really enjoyed my stay. The wifi signal was very strong, and the TV a good quality picture. One small issue was being booked onto the SuperShuttle by the hotel when I thought I was being booked onto their own airport shuttle service - I could have booked myself for less! Was a;5
Stayed here for 6 nights, 3 adults sharing a twin room. Easily enough space to accommodate us all. Check-in was swift and desk staff were really pleasant and helpful. The Art Deco finish is a really pleasant change to most modern hotels where everything is the same, the attention to detail here is fabulous, even down to the bathroom fixtures and fittings. This iconic hotel's location is very good, close to Penn Station, Empire State Building and even Times Square is only a 10 minute stroll away. The local tour buses all stop outside the hotel so it's easy to get to other parts of Manhattan. Tick Tock Diner is convenient when you've had a busy day and want something informal. Portions are huge. Bianca Trattoria is more formal but is still relaxed however it is considerably more;4
Great location good clean rooms really comfy beds need after twelve hours on your feet!  Good choice of breakfast in the adjoining tick tick diner would stay here again if I was lucky enough to Very central for The sights and the Subway;4
"Was in NYC for 10 days vacation and stayed here the entire time. Excellent location for doing all the touristy things. We went from the Statue of Liberty to Central Park to Coney Island & everywhere in between & either walked or used the subway for everything. Lots of places to eat & shop around the hotel and the subway couldn't be any more convenient. Staff posted at elevators checked room keys for security. One concierge not too helpful, second one was better. Check-in staff nice, friendly & very accommodating. Lobby was always hopping. Best thing we liked about the hotel is its LOCATION. Least things we liked was the non-view from the room; the size of the room (however this was totally expected so didn't come as a surprise); and the outdatedness of the bathroom BUT";4
This hotel was on a long, sad slide from it's hey-day in the 1930's and 40's, but Wyndham has done a sensible and thorough restoration, taking care to keep the Deco details intact, while thoroughly modernizing every aspect of the hotel, from hi-speed wireless to well-appointed bathrooms with excellent water pressure. (And flush-o-meter toilets for any plumbing fans out there!)  Close to the Garden and Herald Square, and a 1-minute walk away from numerous subway (that's the Metro, for the uninitiated) lines, with bus service, both crosstown, via 34th St and uptown,via 8th Avenue, right at your door. Excellent and friendly staff.;4
We stayed here for a few nights during the weekend and it was very nice. The staff was very helpful and respectful/kind. We were able to check in early, which was nice (thought the hotel does offer bag checks in the lobby for $2/ea.) The room was small, though that's to be expected in older hotels and about on par with other Manhattan hotels I've visited. It was all very clean and well kept, with a nice view. There was an odd whirring noise (possibly from a mechanical room? Unsure) during the day one day, but with the sounds of the city, it wasn't too bad. The hotel isn't cheap, but again, it's comparable to the area and wasn't excessive in my opinion. I would absolutely stay again.;4
Great location, but not cheap. Staff is much friendlier than before. There was a roach in my room, but when I told the staff, she quickly apologized and moved me to another (upgraded) room. It's  New York City, so I expect critters.;4
We arrived around 10 AM on Friday May 20th.   Pros: - We got an early check in at the desk for just a $25 fee (if your room wasn't ready, they did let you check the baggage with them) - Everything was clean - They make sure you have a room key before you enter the elevator area - They have a little museum downstairs from the lobby about the hotel (we didnt visit this as we didn't have time) - They let us have a late check out for no additional fee at 1:00 PM - View was pretty decent from 35th floor  Cons: - Our hairdryer did not work (we plugged it in and it made a burning smell) - we called downstairs and it took about twenty minutes to get a new one, which, didnt work well because we had a show we had to be at in ten minutes. - The room was a lot smaller than the picture. -;3
"After the shock of NY hotel prices in May (Graduation!!) wore off, I would say that this hotel was a bargain. Excellent service, professional staff and very modern, clean and comfortable rooms.   The cozy bed and Nespresso machine in the room were lovely. An unexpected treat was the history of this building. Nicola Tesla lived here and many famous people have spent time at this NY landmark. Watch for plaques around this building and others to learn more about the history of NY.   And yes, you hear the sirens and traffic, but it's New York; bring ear plugs!!";4
The Wyndham New Yorker is still my favorite hotel to stay at when visiting NYC.  The location alone is priceless.  There are many places to go, things to do and see in walking distance from the hotel.  Penn Station and the subway lines are also within a block or so, which makes it extremely easy to get around.  The staff is consistently friendly and helpful.  It is always nice to know that someone familiar will be there upon check-in and/or if I need something during my stay.  The rooms are quite clean and kept in quality condition.  I feel very comfortable each and every time I stay at The New Yorker A Wyndham Hotel.;5
We stayed a numberf of nights at this hotel while in New YUork City.  I hadn't thought of the arfea as attractive to tourist, but aftger I had a chance to look around, I saw that it was diagonally across the street from Penn Station, and perhaps a fifteen or twenty minute walk from Times Square,  There were plenty of crowds in the arfea, and the hotel itself seemed to host many visors and tour groups, from the U.S. and overseas.  We were able to get a refurbished room on a floor that clearly had been updated.  Try to get a room on such a floor.  New York City hotels are known for small rooms, but I can't really complain about our room.  Maybe because the hotel is not new, rooms were signed bigger in the past than now.  So a refurbished room in such a hotel is worth spending time;4
I went to New york for 2 days with wife and 2 kids (teenagers) and stayed overnight in this hotel. The hotel is within new your city. It is a walking distance from time square, broadway, central park  and all the city's tourist attractions. The building looked like it was an old hotel but when you got inside it was a different story. It was newly renovated and everything was new. The room was very comfortable, quiet and felt very safe. we had a small window that could see the street outside. When you are in the hotel already (groundfloor)and are checking in, you can take the escalator and go down to the lower ground floor where the bathrooms are located and it is like a mini museum. Old pictures and memorabilias are displayed and that floor was not renoveted. It was preserved.;4
My best friend and I stayed for three nights at this hotel - which, as we found out, was in the middle of EVERYTHING!!  Practically across the street from Madison Square Garden - where we were seeing a concert while in town - just up the stairs from the Penn Station subway station, so our commute to the hotel from the subway was, literally, steps away.  Nicely apointed, and friendly hotel staff  We were blocks away from Times Square which we visited every day (always something NEW to see...whether you're looking for it or not).  The bathroom was on the small side, but clean - so no real complaints.  Would I stay here again?  MOST DEFINITELY!!  ...just don't eat at the Tick Tock Diner...;4
The Wyndham is very well located close to Penn Station and right next to 34th Street subway . getting around New York from the hotel is very easy , just a few blocks away from Times Square , 42nd street and Broadway . The subway is very easy to negotiate  and very reasonably priced ($2.75 for a senior citizen) . Travelling by  taxi is  very expensive and frustrating , traffic is often grid locked and pedestrians ignore traffic signals which adds to the general chaos . The subway is the way to go. We arrived at the Wyndham late at night after an eleven hour train journey from Niagara Falls we were tired and looking forward to bed . We were greeted by a lovely young lady called Chrystal who immediately put us at ease and was most welcoming . when she learned we were celebrating;4
For NY hotels, this hotel was priced well.Had good service from needing a shower cap to in-room coffee maker.The Tick Tock Diner was an added plus with good food at reasonable prices.Cleaning staff always smiling & efficient.Helpful staff to help with loading luggage into van upon leaving.Convenient to subway.I enjoyed reading the history located on the basement level.;4
Stayed for 2 nights. The place looks historic but at least is kept well. No problem with service everything was good. The location is great right outside the NYC Penn Station. The room was a it small but it is nice I there and it was good enough to for me. I would definitely stay here again !;4
After reading glowing reviews for this supposedly 4-star art deco wonder, I stayed here for two nights. What a disappointment! The Wyndham New Yorker is simply awful. Dirty, old, musty, yellowed with age, inelegantly decorated, and not updated in decades.   I was given a room on the 20th floor, which on the face of it, altitude-wise, was great. But as I stepped off the elevator and traversed a couple hallways to my room, could not help noting the distress and filth along the marble base boards. My room was small, the bathroom tiny, and like the rest of floor, old, depressingly decorated (yellows and browns in my room). The door frames and moldings had so many layers of paint from cheap makeovers, they had acquired a distorted, misshapen, pimply aspect. The standalone porcelain;1
This hotel is in a perfect location - 1 min walk to the subway, 5 min walk to the Empire State Building and around a 15-20 min walk to Times Square.   The only bad thing I have to say is that the room we booked - the cheapest - was tiny so you struggle to fit 2 suitcases in and also don't shower with the door open as the steam sets off the smoke alarm!!   Other than that, an amazing pizza restaurant, Famiglia is just across the road.   Customer service from all staff was amazing. Guy on reception desk was lovely and so was the man who helped with our luggage. So all in all, a great time in this hotel!;4
My 12 year old daughter and I decided to head to NYC last minute during April Vacation.  I booked the Wyndham New Yorker hotel and was very happy, the rooms were small but very clean and was perfect for us.  Location was within walking distance to everything we wanted to do, Times Square, Theater District and Central Park (that was a little bit of a walk to Central Park but we did it)   There are 2 restaurants on site, we only ate at the 24hr Diner not the Italian place but the diner was very good.  We had a great time and will absolutly consider this hotel again next time we are planning a trip to NYC;5
Door to room and door to bathroom both rattled ALL night due to wind drafts. Horrible sleeping from that noise, as sounded like people were trying to get in. Bathroom window doesn't stay shut, letting in wind and cold air. Internet so slow we gave up.  Property is tired, especially hallways.  Overpriced given all of that.;3
The best part about the hotel is its location, walking distance for all the locations and near to A, C, E line on Penn station. But that's the only good part about the hotel.  The hotel is still looks very dated and inspite of all the makeovers there is still a lot of work to be done. The suite rooms are dated and not worth it, maybe the refurbished single rooms might be better. Considering the scale of hotel it's a pain to ask for anything be it fresh towels or coffee cups, they take ages to arrive. Wish they complete the renovation ASAP and regain there past glory;3
We took a trip with our two little ones ages 5 and 7 to see the sights.  Wanted to make things as simple as possible so we stayed at Wyndham due to its proximity to Penn Station.  Long story short we were sent to our room which was on floor 18.  The door wouldn't open with either room key.  Went back down and a rude front desk woman said my cell phone must have been too close to it.  We knew otherwise because the door seemed broken/loose.  We were sent back up again carrying all of our bags and our tired kids.  Wouldn't open again.  Everyone was tired of walking but went back down and was told to go security.  Security told us to go back up and wait for someone to help.  We went back up exhausted carrying all of our bags still and sat on the floor and wAited.  Nobody came.  The;3
My office recently booked me at the Wyndham near Penn Station. It was a good location but when I realized The Wyndham was the old New Yorker Hotel, I was a bit skeptical. The New Yorker had gone down hill and I thought it had closed after serving as headquarters for a religious group.  However, when I arrived I found the hotel totally renovated. It's a large hotel but I found the front desk personnel very helpful. I arrived a little before check-in and they didn't have a room but when I told them I needed to change to get ready for an event, they were able to arrange it. The room itself was lovely, totally renovated with a new bathroom and flat screen television and up-to date decor.  The location is great, near the theatre district, subways and TIme Square. The one issue I had;4
Just back from 4 days staying at the New Yorker. Had requested an accessible room via travel agent however this information was not passed to the hotel. Explained requirements to reception and the girl changed our room.. And gave us an early check in!! FANTASTIC.  Great room, spotless with loads of room for all the shopping.  Brilliant location - Hotel is across the road from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.. Couple streets from Macy's and Empire State Building..   Would recommend this hotel and definitely stay there next time we are in NYC 🗽❤️;4
A beautiful hotel with lovely Art Deco features. Though not in the very heart of New York, Times Square is an easy walk away and some rooms have great views of the Empire States Building. The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful - we even got a coffee/tea making machine delivered to our room within minutes of our arrival.;4
The new yorker is an old girl.  The rooms are small but have everything you need.   The bathrooms are quite poor and have definitely seen better days but to rip them out would mean removing period features so it's a bit hard to know what would be best.  The painted tiles aren't pleasant though especially where the paint is peeling.  The diner is probably the hotel's best feature.   We used this a lot and found it being on site very useful.;4
My mother who is Diamond member booked my husband and baby and I here for the weekend trying to do something nice. She confirmed multiple times including last night that we had the NY View Queen Suite. It even showed up online last night that was the room we were confirmed in. Unfortunately we got here and the reservation was changed to a double room. The management were rude and condescending kept telling me they were taking care of things. I am still waiting on Stephen the Concierge Manager to finish taking care of the things we were promised.   we did finally get the fridge it we were promised it only took numerous calls.  And after those calls They did replace the spoiled milk. Barry the operations manager told me he had no intention of trying at all to solve the issue.;1
Purchased the hotel room via Priceline on one of their secret deals. At first I was scared it was going to be horrible because it was one of their Art Deco rooms and the reviews on here were mixed but I was fairly suprised. I was traveling with my 3 year old so I didn't want to worry about anything.   The check in was quick and easy,  they even had a room available for early check in. We asked for a mini fridge for water and snacks as well as a coffee maker and they brought it up within minutes.  There is a CVS and a Duane Reade across the street so we bought water, coffee pods, creamer and snacks for our toddler.   The room was nice and clean.  The bathroom was a little outdated however it was clean.  Over all, great experience .  It was quiet, clean,  in a great location near;5
I can not say enough great things about this hotel and their staff they are truly remarkable. The rooms are clean and the bed are extremely comfortable.;5
My Grandson and I celebrated our mutual birthday with a stay at the New Yorker. He was most impressed with the spectacular view of the Empire State Building! I enjoyed the location and excellent desk agent who provided us with a complimentary breakfast in celebration of our birthday.;5
Very nice Hotel, clean rooms, the bathroom small. but is an excelente option for price, location an service. very recomended, If I ame back to New York , definilly i is my first option. Wi-fi  works excelente in the room;5
Stayed here for my birthday weekend. Didn't realize what a great location this was till I got there. There was some construction going on while there though that distracts from the exterior. Almost anything you need is within a reasonable distance, shopping (Herald Sq. Macy's), sports (Madison Sq. Garden), movies AMC 34th St.), food and also easy access to the subway. The Tick Tock diner, open 24 hours is within the premises and offers decent meals.   I think the staff, for being a very busy place, were always courteous.  The room was small, but manageable and overall, I had a great time here.;4
We landed lucky with the New Yorker for our first trip to NYC. We needed a hotel that was affordable but hoped for one that would enhance our visit, and this delivered both - thanks especially to a great bit of customer service. Our room, though not large, was clean and smart, with a nod to the building's heritage. However, we'd paid a small supplement for a view and initially had a pretty poor one. We'd arrived late that night but for our remaining two nights, Kristal at reception (apologies if I've spelled that wrongly) found us a high corner room with an incredible view straight onto the Empire State Building from its main window and a different vista from the side. Absolutely majestic: I sat looking out for long stretches of time. I didn't catch Kristal again to thank her;5
I stated her and attended sa conference about twenty minutes walk away .  I got here from LGA airport via Bus Q70 and then the subway. Then a short walk to the hotel. The NewYorker is older but classy older. Lots of marble. I love the look since I love vintage.  Nice workout room. I had a corner room two queen beds two closets and two full baths, wow in New Yirk this is luxury especially for the price.  I ate a burger at the hotel restaurant bar and it was fabulous. So much I could not finish and a great deal    Yes I will return.  Enjoy.;5
The hotel is a good value for money and the location is superb! . The rooms are comfortable although on the small side. There is no coffee making facilities in the room but there is a Starbucks and MacDonald's across the road The staff is very friendly and help full. The lady concierge is extremely knowledgeable and has excellent tips for eating places in different places in NY and also, what time is the best visit a specific location. There is a lovely restaurant next door to the hotel with an entrance from the hotel foyer. Will definitely stay there again when in New York;4
Easy location for walking Times Square etc , grand central station and shops. Clean rooms bathroom could do with a update . Healpfull staff , who pointed us in the right direction for a fantastic meal . At chans pipe house expensive but worth every dollar .  Also opposite the Madison square gardens;4
"the hotel is as you would expect for a central Nyc hotel . The corridors are like rabbit warrens and the rooms vary in size and noise level . My room was defiantly ""compact"" and a little worn ( especially the bath room) that said , it was comfortable and very peaceful which is a huge bonus in NYC . The tic toc diner in the lobby is 24 hours and is fairly decent . There are pletly of places close by to eat ,drink and shop . And it's a stones throw from Madison Sq gdns .   Overall I would say it's a fairly good choice to use as a base . If you are looking for luxury then this isn't the place for you .";3
Depressing, run down hotel.  I can't believe I paid 500.00 a night for a tiny, dark room with chipped plaster, peeling paint and plastic blinds.    Front desk personnel are not service friendly.   They were rude and unhelpful.    Check out chipped plaster around shower drain.  The photo of the door to my room is gashed across the width of it;1
Been here twice now and both times I have enjoyed my stay. The hotel is welcoming and classic in decor, the staff are friendly and will help with anything you need.   The rooms are clean and tidy whilst being well equipped for a short or long stay. The maids come in everyday and make the beds as well as replacing towels if needed.   Location is ideal, subway next door as well as Times Square and Empire State Building within 10min walk.   Will certainly stay again should I visit NYC in the near future.;5
We initially wanted to stay at the Waldorf (which we love) but it was booked out so looked for another historical hotel.  The New Yorker fitted the bill - great history, with a small museum display, and an iconic building.  Our room had a postcard view looking straight at the skyline including the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings. We were close to many subway lines (including the PATH to NJ), 3 blocks from the Empire State, next to Madison Square Garden (where we were going) plus close to many shops including 7th Ave (Fashion Avenue). It has a 24 hour diner, Tick Tock - not the best food but handy for late night snacks and drinks.  We got everywhere we wanted to go very quickly.  Will always stay there from now on mainly because of the convenient location.;5
"Good location ( near Penn Station /Madison Square Garden, Macy's, Empire State) but noisy!   I booked the hotel at website and prepaid it.  During my checkout I asked the hotel bill receipt to check it and everything was okay! It wasn't a ""great experience"" but it was okay. The next door room noisy bother me a little during the night and early morning.  The hotel room's soundproofing needs to fix.";3
"If you enjoy the hustle and bustle of New York City, then you will love the location of this hotel. We took the train from Newark Airport to Penn Station ($13.00) and this hotel is only a two block walk. Access any location in New York from Penn Station for only $2.75 (one-way). This is definitely not the upscale part of New York, but it is affordable and hip. The hotel is clean and safe and accommodating. Private elevators for floors 20-40 with really amazing city and harbor views. Walk to Best Bagel and Coffee before you leave. Look at the menu before arriving because patience is not their virtue__but you will feel like you are getting a real ""New Yorker"" experience.   **Just a side note for families with little ones: They do not offer refrigerators or microwaves, so I was not";4
Fantastic hotel for location!! Central to almost everything - it's a 15-20 minute walk to Times Square and when you come out the hotel turn right, walk to the end of the street and look left you will see the Empire State Building! We arrived to the hotel after 11 hours of travelling, the receptionist was lovely and very helpful - gave us lots of information and let us check out late for a fee. We booked the New Yorker suite with 2 double beds and sofa bed for the 5 of us. The receptionist said she would send someone up to make the sofa bed which was fine with us. By the time we left the suitcases, went to get something to eat and came back up the bed still wasn't made. We found the linen in the closet and made it up ourselves which isn't ideal after travelling all that time, all;5
We stayed here for a week, and the location was fantastic, easy walking to all the sights. Hotel had its own diner, which was open 24 hours, and a restaurant as well. We were on 36th floor, our room was quiet small, but it was clean and room service changed towels daily and made up beds. Would definitely stay there again, but maybe upgrade our metro room to something slightly larger.;4
The New Yorker with its elegant style was a great hotel for a business trip!  Everything was very nice, very clean and very quiet!   I would particularly like to point out how friendly and helpful Anianna was in the checking process. She was very nice after a long trip for me, and extremely helpful.;5
Hotel very central.  A bit dated.  Cracked tiles in bathroom which has caused DAMPNESS in bedroom. We booked a double queen suite and never got the room we booked . Got $25 a night off for as a result.  Still wasn't happy though.;3
A hotel of good standard with good size rooms. that is close to Penn station, a main tube station, and Macy's  department store. 8 blocks south of times square, on 8th avenue. ideal for short transfers from Newark Airport. a la cart restaurant and bar, also a typical New York diner attached to the hotel.;4
Great location - near buses, subway, taxis.  Good price, beautiful art deco lobby, large rooms. Very helpful staff - particularly Mohammed- who promptly cleared up some confusion about our room.  Have stayed there twice and intend to return again.;5
We chose this hotel due to its proximity to Penn Station - this made it really easy to find after getting the train from Newark Airport. I thinks its always a good idea to minimise time faffing around trying to find the hotel and maximise time spent enjoying the holiday!  The room was not large, but plenty big enough for a weekend break in NYC. The bed was comfy and the shower was hot. The staff were exceptional and always went above and beyond to help us out. This really made the stay a lot more enjoyable.  Don't bother with the diner that is attached to the hotel, we tried it for breakfast one day and it served the purpose but there are plenty of better places to eat nearby. Just ask the concierge!;4
Wow what a hotel, the hotel is key location when staying in New York, it's great distance from every where, time square, tube station. The tick-tock dinner that is within the hotel is very good.  When we arrived at the hotel the check in was very easy and very fast, our room was cleaned and bed turned down every day.  We would stay there again in a heart beat;5
We stayed for a friend's 30th for a week. This was a fantastic location. The rooms where basic but very clean and the beds where so comfortable. We had an amazing view out of both windows in our room. Would definitely stay here again!;5
This hotel opened in 1930 so is older but very well kept. Many of the rooms have great views. You can't beat the location. You can easily walk to Broadway/Times Square, Central Park, Penn Station, 5th Avenue and many other great places. You do have to pay to valet your car, but parking is onsite and you can park your car prior to check in. That's a huge advantage for getting around in the city. This is a great value and experience.;5
"Years ago, when I first dreamt of going to New York, I decided I wanted to stay at the New Yorker. Don't know why, it just appealed to me for some reason. My wish finally came true this month. What a great place to stay. Friendly & helpful staff, clean & comfortable room - a little small, but it is NYC & we barely spent any time there, apart from sleeping!! The Tick Tock Diner is great! As is Trattoria Bianca, the bar & restaurant. Great Cosmopolitans!!! ;) My only small disappointment was that we booked a Metro View Room & there wasn't much of a view, even though we were on the 28th floor. Even so, I wouldn't hesitate in staying there again.";4
My in-laws, Wendell and Virginia had their honeymoon at the New Yorker in 1952. The entire family recreated the weekend for them. Joe stein , keeper of the artifacts gave us a private tour of the hotel's historical spaces, the manager , front desk, room staff and restaurant staff treated us like royals.  I would recommend this beautifully preserved Art Deco hotel to any traveler who wants a bit of class and style and service.  Or just stay in New Jersey like all the other travel lemmings. Just sayin, class in travel is still available for the average traveller;5
The hotel was lovely. Our floor was a little older looking but they were in the middle of renovating other floors and the room itself was perfect. Check in took quite a long time but the staff came and apologised and were very friendly and helpful so we didn't mind. The rooms are kept immaculate and it was cleaned every single day. The bedding was changed and there were loads of towels, also changed daily - they even folded any clothes that were left on the bed!! Very impressed! The diner downstairs was excellent. Are there twice, once for breakfast and once in the evening - the food was lovely and service was quick. Didn't go to the bar though. Security was excellent too and you had to show your room card before going to the elevator area. The only negative was on our last day;4
very clean, good location.  in-hotel restaurants were excellent.  no coffee maker in the room which was a disappointment, but we didn't stay in the room that long.  But it would have been nice to enjoy a cup of coffee while preparing for the day;5
The Wyndham New Yorker Hotel is the best choice anyone can make who wants to be in the middle of it all in the big apple for an affordable price! Friendly staff , quiet rooms , safe stay! Every activity we went was in walking distance. The 24 hours restaurant in the lobby made it a must for my 24 hours hungry belly.;5
The Hotel was very clean   tidy. Staff very helpful. Very busy yet got sorted with our room quickly. Staff near the lifts asking what room and looking at our room cards was very good as anyone can just walk into a hotel these days. Our Room was very small but clean and tidy. Was very dark only had a small window without any view only the other side of the hotel all windows. Bathroom clean tidy again very small and old fashioned. Slept well and it was very quiet from all the traffic from the city. I would have liked  a room with a view But if we did we would have to wait a few hours. After a long flight from the UK just wanted to have a shower and a rest before evening meal. Yet a room was booked I do think they should have had a good room and we did pay a lot of money for just;3
We wanted to see a broadway show and needed to find a clean and economic place to stay.  This was it!  This hotel is an oldie but a goodie.  Sure I have stayed in high end hotels in NYC but if you want to save your $$ for enjoying the city, this hotel is great.  It was clean, quiet, nice view, a good security.  The hotel staff were very polite and helpful.  The bathrooms need a bit of updating e.g. no vented fans.  Overall, a pleasant stay and an reasonably priced.;4
Best features of this hotel are the clean and comfortable rooms, Art Deco architecture and the happy staff. Stayed here 5 days and walked to everything within 30 minutes or so. Great food at the attached diner, Tick Tock diner. Enjoyed the hotel history in the basement display area.  My workout was  in the clean and spacious fitness center. Nice stay.;5
Location was great, view was an awful brick wall, room was tiny and a bit dingy. The location for us was the highlight of the trip. During the spring it allowed us to walk everywhere we went without the extra cost of cabs always a plus 😀;3
Rooms are outdated and small, but what to expect from the old building.  Location was perfect for us since Penn train station is just one block away. Not too far from Times Square, and Broadway theaters.;3
The rooms were small, like many New York City hotels, but the bed was comfortable and the room nicely appointed.  The lobby.  Oh my.  I met my future brother-in-law at the New Yorker in 1969, and I remember vividly the gold elevator doors in the Art Deco lobby.  The shape of the hotel room doors were concave, then.  It was a nostalgic trip, quite comfortable.;4
We booked two rooms with my family, and we enjoyed our stay. The location is great and is close to almost everything. We could walk to almost all the attractions. The adjacent restaurant was wonderful. The rooms are clean and reasonably spacious. The lobby is quite big for NY. I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone who is looking for comfort during your stay in NYC.;5
I can tell that this hotel is art-deco, however being art deco does not mean being not well maniatinned. My faucet licked water and was hard to get rid of the water once I used it. They did not offer water (at least one bottled water) as some or most hotels do now, phones were old and hard to use, the good thing is that now with their extra fee they gave me unlimited international calls, internet and it was easier for me. Samira the front desk clerk is practically a non-desirable person to deal with, rude, arrogant and with zero sense of service and i think she should be in another position. The Front Desk manager on the other hand was very gentile, understood my complain and assisted me with all details needed.;4
Well kept hotel. Our room was plenty big and well decorated. Staff were extremely helpful. Location is good for Broadway shows/subways/time square. Security was extremely careful regarding people being able to have room floor access and lobby area. restaurant in hotel has good food at reasonable prices for NYC. Great value for the price all the way around.;4
The location is very central which is the best part of this hotel. We did luck out when we booked two doubles, the room came with two bathrooms and two closets which is perfect for a girlfriend get away. The downsides were the dimly lit room which looks old and tired despite some attempts to update. The front desk and baggage check-in clerks have attitude, but I think that's the NY customer service. The worst part was when it came to pay, there were so many additional fees on top of tax at 14.75%, there was a resort fee, city tax, etc. Be prepared for a shock when you get your final bill.;3
I really don't understand the negative comments on here.  For the price, it was a great hotel.  If you want perfection then you pay for a five star!  We stayed here for a week starting May 7th and had a great time.  The wi fi was fine, the room although basic was perfectly adequate and the food at a The Tick Tock Diner was brilliant.  Yes it was a tad pricey, but this is New York and unless you are living on street food you should expect to pay a little more to eat.  The central location of the hotel is perfect and the staff were very helpful. Jessica who checked us in was lovely ( a welcome relief after the 2+ hours wait to get out of JFK airport!).  We arrived feeling exhausted and disappointed with the NY people after our dealings with the JFK staff, but Jessica proved that;4
I chose this hotel because of its excellent location, and because it was a Wyndham brand so I expected a certain level of service. Unfortunately, this was the biggest mistake of my vacation. We arrived at the hotel around 3:30 and there was an extremely long line to check in. A gentleman behind us mentioned that he had stayed here before and seen similar lines even at 9 p.m. so this was not unusual. When we finally arrived to the front, the woman at the desk was extremely rude. She rushed through everything she was telling me without looking at me once, so it was hard to understand her mutterings. I realized I agreed to the dreaded hotel fee everyone on TripAdvisor mentioned without the desk agent even mentioning that she was charging my card. She then, under her breath,;1
Huge lobby that tends to be over crowded due to the immense amount of people that the hotel can host. We stayed in a double bedroom, on the 21st floor, very very small without fridge, cold due to bad windows that can't keep the wind out and as a result it becomes cold over night. As we got in to the room we noticed it is not properly cleaned, it is dusty and not hoovered. The airco works fine but is loud. The shower drips constantly which can be irritating over night when one wants to sleep. Plastic glasses and no bottle opener, no fridge too but there is no place for it as room is too small. Decoration is out dated and dark, maybe to prevent from seeing how dirty it can get. Housekeeping is not very efficient. Room had a safe, it's own ironing board and iron, which i could say;2
We stayed here twice, a week apart during late April and then mid-May. On arrival the hotel has a big lobby area, but was clearly very busy, with masses of bodies filling the area, checking in, and out. There was also a curious smell in the Lobby area, that existed across the hotel to a lesser extent.  We were unable to check in early, and in fact not even on time, we had to wait an additional 30 minutes the first time, and longer the second time. Checkin is reasonably straight forward, however the delays in getting rooms means there are often queues of people waiting.   We booked a two room suite each time, and although the first suite was cheaper, for the same number of days, it was far better, on the 22nd Floor (of 40). The second suite was much smaller, and less comfortable;3
Close to bargain shops food and drink establishment approx 100 metres away from Madison Square Garden and not too far from Times Square Penn subway station just round the corner. The room was clean and tidy very compact room with very little space for storage besides the wardrobe. Old style bathrooms which provided a lot of character. MacDonalds right across the road for late night eating if you don't want to go to far.;5
"The good: good water pressure in the showers; great location and train/subway access; professional and friendly front desk staff, particularly Crystal and Jose; pretty good WiFi in Lobby; in-room safe; security to confirm people are guests before boarding elevator.   The bad: really crappy WiFi in rooms, at least on the 27th floor (disconnected every 10 minutes, inconsistent performance when it was working) and bad offshore tech support (meaning, they will tell you to reboot your device or pretend they did something when in fact nothing usefull is done); slow housekeeping which means rooms may not be ready for new guests by checkin time.  If in-room wifi is important to you then I recommend you consider an alternative place to stay. No filtered water cooler in fitness room.   If";3
My friend and I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights recently, Metro View Double Room @ £159 (GBP) per night.  Please note there is a $27.22 (USD) per room per night non-optional resort fee payable upon checkin, even if you do not plan to use the other facilities.  Breakfast can be added on for $28 USD per person per night but we found that the 24/7 'Tick Tock' dinner in the hotel only ever came to a maximum of $15-18 USD per person (not including tip), we loved their chocolate chip pancakes.  The room was very very small, barely could accommodate the twin beds with enough room to walk around them without doing yourself an injury.  The bathroom was even smaller but it had the basics you might need. However after the 1st day and our use of the provided toiletries they were never;3
We spent three days at the Wyndham New Yorker and found it very clean and convenient for transport. It's within a block of Penn Station and the Amtrak, and even you have two different metro stations with 6 different lines within two blocks. It also has a number of decent restaurants nearby and is in easy walking distance to the empire state building.   The room was clean and comfortable and you had to show your key card to staff to access the elevators, which is a nice security feature for women traveling alone.  They hold you bag for free the day you check in if you check in early and the room is not ready, or you can store your bag with them for $2.00 a bag the day you check out.;5
The Wyndham was right in the middle of things, a short walk from Penn Station and Madison Sq. Garden.  The room was small but clean and neat.  The Tick-Tock Diner in the hotel was open 24 hours and the other restaurant was good too.  Highly recommended!;5
This hotel was good value for money and a great location, not too far from Times Square but far enough for a peaceful nights sleep. Our room and bathroom were just like the photos on the web, small but not cramped. The decor was lovely had a 1920,s feel about it and the staff were very friendly, helpful and pleasant. The only downside is you get billed for the amenities  even if you don't use them ! (This is apparently on your booking paperwork). As a good will gesture the hotel wavared the bill as we  didn't use any amenities and weren't aware that we would be charged anyway. I would definitely return to this hotel if I was to visit New York again.;5
Stayed at this hotel early May brilliant location and great service highly recommended ,only there few days but did a tour  'New York in a day ' couldn't believe how much we covered our guide Gill was funny and informative .pizzeria flamagios opposite for inexpensive fresh Italian food;4
Flew into Newark, took train to Penn Station under MSG, hotel was right there, about a block away- easy way. Went to convert at MSG, great location for it. Had a diner at hotel that was open 24 hours. Friendly staff. Time Square about a 10 block walk, can see Empire State Building down the one street not far away. Room was fine, needs updated.;4
The hotel is a landmark and there were pictures of the way it looked through the years.  That was very interesting.  The hotel overall was nice, and the staff was friendly.  The room we stayed in was very small.  I wouldn't stay there again, unless there were larger rooms.  The internet was also very slow.;3
"This hotel has several pluses none of which are related to rooms:  • great location literally across from Penn station • historical exterior • impressive lobby  We got one of the old rooms which was in urgent need of refurbishment and in its current state can only be described as horrendous. It was small, noisy, dark and dirty with a décor straight from the 1970s. The bathroom was equally bad and tired with old uneven tiles painted over by green paint.  And the final insult was their ""resort fee"" which is basically a $27 mandatory charge per day for Internet access.  Avoid this dump, there are lots of better hotels in Manhattan.";2
Just returned from incredible trip to New York. We stayed at the New Yorker where we were upgraded to a suite in celebration of our 15th wedding anniversary.  The room had spectacular views of the city.  Our upgrade also included breakfast at Tick Tock Diner which was good.  The hotel is located within walking distance to Macy's, Empire State Building, subway, Time Square, Penn Station and AMC Movie Theatre.   We used the exercise room a few times which had lots of equipment. The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I would stay here again.;4
We booked this hotel at a great price for 5 of us sharing, we were there to celebrate a 50th birthday and had told the hotel this. We expected it would be a bit tight and knew there was extra charges to pay for services. However on arrival we were told that our room wasn't quite ready and given drinks while we waited in the bar. we were delighted when we got our room to find it was very spacious, they had left a bottle of Gin, a fruit platter and a birthday cake made of towels. In addition they waived all service charges. The most amazing part was looking out our window at the views of Empire State, Chrysler and Madison Square Gardens! The hotel made our trip, it was ideally located and the staff couldn't do enough for us. The hotel is under renovation but none of that took away;5
Great trip and wonderful visit with Wyndham Great help getting a cab back to airport which meant a lot being I have never traveled;5
For me its all about the people, and the staff at the Wyndham New Yorker are the best!  We are a group of 5 over to celebrate a birthday and not only were we upgraded to a fantastic suite with terrific views, we arrived in our suite to a lovely display of towels made up into a double layer birthday cake with a Happy Birthday banner and a bottle of gin & a few bottles of tonic (the birthday girls preferred drink).  We were also waived all extra fees for wifi and facilities and given a late checkout FOC!  That was just the beginning!  What a staff...you should all be proud of yourselves nothing was too much trouble and we loved every minute of our stay with you.  As for the hotel...location is fantastic, beds are big and comfy, rooms are spacious and shower is powerful.;5
Rooms are really small. Two people can not walk by each other. The hotel is old and run down. Service is the worst I ever experienced! The hotel is run down. My major problem is on 5/10/2016 we never got room service. We had the do not disturb sign on the door until 12:15 pm and then remove it. At 3pm I came back they told me the do not disturb sign was on the door I told them it was not, either way, the room is not done and we have no toilet paper. he said we will send it right up and clean your room at 9 pm still nothing! No one would answer the front desk phone. I went down and talked to JB or GB he was rude and ignorant. I called national Reservation desk they could not help and sent me to customer care 4 times no on answered the phone. I had o call prince line to get help 9;1
When we checked in we received a nice gift from the hotel staff because it was our anniversary.  We also received an unknown  upgrade charge upon our exit.  we did not ask for an upgrade, nor were we told we were receiving an upgrade.  I did not report the additional charge as we had to leave to catch a train;3
I'm all for retro style but these rooms and corridors are just grim! It saddens me to walk into such a tired dreary room. The windows are drafty too. The paint peeling off the bathroom which is tiny. Nowhere to rest the hairdryer except on the toilet seat. In this day I expect much better from an alleged four star in New York.;2
On Priceline this hotel was advertised as a four-star hotel.  I would rated this hotel between a two or three star.  Although I received a great price it was run down and did not meet my standards.  I personally would not stay here again.;2
when we first stayed here the room was great we even had a balcony 2 time was also ok but third time was rubbish the room was really tiny and the bathroom was even smaller just enough room to get in ,it seems since the wyndham has taken over the hotel has gone backwards they now charge a resort tax or as they now call it a facility fee with tax is 29 dollars which they never used to charge so save your money and stay else where;2
Hotel is in a great location. Near Penn Station and Subway system.  Ideal when you train into NY Penn.  Rooms vary in size from Small to reasonable.  Great Gym but you do pay for it in your bill but worth it if you travel.  I stay here often mainly due to the value and location compared to other hotels.;3
The location of the New Yorker is phenomenal !!  Incredibly central to shopping and the subway.  The hotel is very busy with international tourists, American tourists, business meetings, and people staying over for in town business.  Even with the continued flow of people throughout the hotel, the common areas were always clean and neat (I have no idea how they could keep up).  The front desk people, the doorman, and the concierge were pleasant, helpful, and wearing smiles at all times.  Our room was a city view double on the corner.  The room was quiet, spacious, clean and decorated in a comfortable yet minimalist vibe.  The bathrooms are very small when compared to current hotel trends but I have to say the shower never ran short of hot water!    Our view was incredible - The;4
We stayed in this hotel wich is in a great location .. the first room we had had a weird smell , so they moved us to a better bigger room thanks! the only complaint is hidden fees : stayed for two days and the fee was $90!!! I complained but they said this is the fees sooo that was it! comeon that does not say in their website or any other place! overall good but please let people know what you getting!;3
Location was amazing, close to Macy's and Empire State Building  Close to subway station  Tourism desk available  Room was a bit tight, no fridge (though it was cold enough outside that I put my fruit and yogurt by the window and it would be cool by morning);4
I have stayed here a couple times for work. Beautiful location. close to everything so that's a bonus. The rooms have always been great too, very clean and comfortable. The only complaint is that the customer service could use a bit of improvement. I understand it's a busy hotel but guests should always come first and be treated with the utmost respect since we are basically the ones paying their wages. Still not a bad place at all to go to and see all that NYC has to offer.;4
The hotel was lovely, staff friendly &  the rooms were clean & inviting. I had read the reviews before we left & did not see any of the things that people complained about. Wi-Fi was free & dependable. Coffee was easily found, within a 1/2 block of the hotel, Dunkin donuts, a local coffee company & Starbucks on the other block. The hotel was central to all of our travels & Madison Square Garden across the street. The Tick Tock was perfect for breakfast. Thanks New Yorker our trip turned out even better because of you!;5
Its a great place to stay. But they do not have proper water, tea, coffee availability in the room.;3
Stayed here for 4 nights, good location with easy subway access, nearby Penn station made it an easy journey from Newark airport. We were able to get our room early which was great as we'd had a long journey from London. High resort fees are not justified by erratic WiFi and $2 charge per item to leave your luggage. Rooms were very small and poky, we had a double double and there was very little room left with 2 suitcases etc, had to do the ironing in the bathroom as the ironing board would not fit in the bedroom! Although it being New York we didn't spend much time in the room. The bathroom was small was a bit grubby although clean towels were provided daily. The 24/7 diner was great for breakfast and late night snacks when needed. So great location for seeing the sites but;3
Having stayed at this hotel previously I was excited to return. Upon check in a lovely lady named Crystal greeted me and we started to have a conversation about the rooms and how last time I didn't have much of a view, she immediately offered to upgrade me to floor 37 and room 3705! The views from this room were incredible, you could see MSG, the new world trade centre and over the hudson! It was so nice to wake up to those views every morning and really did make a difference to our trip!  We spent so much time in the Tick Tock diner as it is so reasonably priced and has such a vast menu! The service was always good and the food was always so quick which meant you had plenty of time to continue to explore NYC. I also love how safe the hotel felt as each time you enter the lobby;5
Would have been a very fine visit...location is fantastic and the hotel room although small was very clean and comfortable (for 2 people).  Only problem was that I had an error booking the room online and accidentally clicked the reservation twice...thus booking 2 rooms instead of 1.  I realized this upon checking in and was told that I had to take it up with the application that I booked through...the advice given was not the problem...it was the attitude of the manager at the hotel that rubbed me the wrong way.  I did get the refund...but it felt like I had to fight for it rather than them gladly helping to fix the problem.  Bad bedside manner for someone in hospitality.;4
I would not stay at this hotel next trip. Very outdated and room is small. There is a foot between bed corner & dresser... banged my leg to walk around to get in bed!! Bed was comfortable though. Didn't get a call that room was ready...finally got room at 10PM!;3
We were on a long weekend break with our family and had booked a family room. The location is great, at walking distance from Penn station, Macy's, Empire State Building and 5th avenue.  Staff is friendly, hotel has the old grandeur, though could do with some refurbishment. Family room was quite spacious, beds rather narrow and bathroom a bit small, though sufficient.;3
stayed for 10 days. This hotel is ALWAYS busy, reception workers are always friendly and willing to help, if you are not pleased with your room ask to change it! we did, and it was great! some of the rooms at the higher floors had an amazing view.   The only thing I didn't like is the fact that you have to pay in order to leave ur luggage (2$ per one suitcase) and the high resort fees.;4
Conveniently located near Madison Sq Garden. Old style and room could be better maintained but clean. Note that the rooms are small, as is the closet. Well equipped gym as well. I am not sure that I will stay here again but some would enjoy it.;4
Staff was helpful and friendly, great lobby with good wifi.  Good location, 8 blocks south of Times Square, subway entrances on streets either side of the hotel,  Instead of eating breakfast or lunch at Tik Tok Diner adjoining the hotel, we liked the Bistro Cafe short order cook or buffet mid-block on 33rd, just past Lowe's Movie Theater. The hotel room doors need pneumatic door closers so they don't slam shut.  If you want soft Kleenex and TP, bring your own.;4
I found this overall a very good place to stay. All the employees I spoke with were very polite and professional with accurate information. The room was very clean and nice. The size was fine for me. Valet parking just took one of the most stressful things about the city (IMO) off of my plate. Best part was the location for what I paid. You are in the middle of everything. I go to NYC a couple times a year and unless something changes, this is where I will continue to go everytime.;4
Great location, average accommodation, really good experience overall. The location of this hotel more than makes up for any shortcomings. I would definitely stay here again. If you want luxury, luxury, luxury then don't bother but for travel on moderate to budget income its great. Two restaurant/cafes on site to choose from. The Trattoria Bianca is very well recommended. Staff are great.;4
We had a wonderful service at this Hotel , Cedris a the réception was very helpful and professional. Thank you for our great stay The rooms are Clean and have Nice views. Near everything. We recommend this Hotel to everyone who wants to be near the action.;5
the hotel is in good location, close to few points in Manhattan that are must be visited. the room is clean and the service are grate. The bathroom need  a stand or shelf for personal things. Total we felt grate to stay.;4
"Guest Services was nice , room was decent , i received an upgrade , "" because a better room was available at the same price "".  All around good experience. Great Location!";5
Several times in the last couple of years I've had to stay overnight in NYC due to trains not making their connections. Each time I've had a great evening either dining out or going to see a broad way show. I highly recommend the Tic Toc Cafe for dining out. It was located in the hotel we stayed at. I highly recommend watching the Lion King for a night on Broad Way.;5
I'm in NYC once every couple of months for some business and some pleasure. If I'm going to have time, I get tickets to a show, plan on a nice dinner and then afterward retire to a room at the New Yorker.  I've stayed at other places, and they're fine. Really. But for me, the New Yorker is just a step above. From the front entrance, the beautiful lobby, a helpful concierge and some very nice front desk people. I always get a room with an Empire view, there's something about opening up that window, having a glass of wine and just knowing you are truly in New York City. The Hudson view is fine, a metro view is ok, but nothing says NYC like that Empire State building.   My room is always spotless, the shower is powerful and hot, the location to various show venues around Broadway;4
Once you get past the very nice Art Deco, the hotel quality is very basic. Rooms were 'very small' and showing their age.  Unplanned extras on the bill for phone and internet services which we were told was manditory and we diid not use!   However, great location for a short trip to New York;3
Driss, front desk staffer, was welcoming and warm! Professional and accommodating. The hotel has old world charm. Clean if small rooms. Friendly staff. Great rates and centrally located. Good 24 hour diner downstairs. Twenty-four hour drugstore across the street. Pennsylvania Station (subway...) one block away. It was a good choice!;4
"I travel to NYC every month and stay at the New Yorker each time; this has been over the past 8-9 years.  I love the hotel, its staff (particularly the very helpful Mohamed) and its great location.  Lots of history and beautiful art deco touch.  Love this hotel!";5
I can't say enough good things about our experience here!  Krystal at the front desk made all the difference! We got a free upgrade to a large, room with a king size bed and a beautiful view of the Empire State and Chrysler buildings.  She also waived the resort fee.  The hotel has a lovely art deco,  glamorous feel.  Parking right across the street is a very reasonable $40. I would certainly stay here again and would definitely recommend this place!;5
This hotel is in an excellent location- walking distance to time square and the subway. Directly across from Madison square gardens and one block from Macy's. Rooms are really comfortable and clean and staff are always helpful. Tick tock diner on the ground floor serves good food and is open 24/ 7.;5
"Had booked for 5 days, and at the time of check-in, I was told that the room was upgraded.   Staying in New York,  you do not expect big rooms,  but ""upgrade"" made me think it was a slightly better room.   There was absolutely no change, same 2 feet clearance around the bed and bathroom which was tough to fit even a person less than 5' 9"".  Except that there was coffee machine in the room.  The only advantage was that it was just 10 minutes walk to the office.";3
Stayed 4 nights in a basic room on holiday. Great location, great staff (front desk and info/security - concierge could use some work). Really enjoyed our stay. Lovely, beautifully redone hotel. Small rooms as most are in these big cities. Very clean, great atmosphere. Would absolutely come again.;4
Booked this months in advance for a special birthday trip and then contacted the hotel explaining that it was for a special stay. The hotel replied but not saying they would help me with my request  Hugely disappointed to find the room we were given had a damaged bath with flaking sharp coating - given another room that was basic and smelled strongly of fresh paint and was far from anything special and certainly not worth the money The reception staff in general seemed to look upon the guests as just more people bringing money to the hotel and certainly didn't feel valued Refused to let the way they looked down on us ruin a great trip to NYC but having stayed in another hotel on a previous trip where I felt like I mattered, I couldn't recommend this one sadly;3
I thought this hotel was fine on a recent visit to NYC.  The location is excellent, especially if arriving by train.  The room was on the small side, but typical for NYC.  Clean, but a bit tired.  Bed comfortable and it was quiet.  Given the price paid, not an especially good value.;3
I thought the location was great and the room was nicely done.  The staff was very pleasant and was located right outside Penn Station which was very helpful.  The room was quiet, but small and served the overnight stay I was looking for.  They will charge you a mandatory fee when you walk in the door for internet, so be prepared for that surprise.  They claim it is mentioned when you make a reservation, but if you book on an outside website you will not see the charge ever mentioned.  It is around $30.    They also offer to keep your bags while you walk the city after your stay is over.  It is $2 a bag, but comes in handy if you want to explore at the end of your trip.  Overall, I enjoyed the stay and would probably stay again due to location and quietness being so close to the;4
Just returned from our trip to New York.   Location of this hotel is a big plus to get around the city for shopping, transporation,. shows,  Great staff to help you.  Nice clean rooms and nice beds for us to get some rest at the end of day after seeing the city Ask for a room with a view it is well worth it because of it's location.  Go the extra for it.;5
Great location and great deli restaurants in the lobby. However, the hotel is OLD, dirty (as in ragged carpet, scuffs on all the walls, etc) and loud. Once they give this place a face lift it will be fantastic - and expensive. There were a few floors on my side of the hotel that were school dorms - weird. I think some of those kids were on my floor as well because it was LOUD. If you get a good price and really don't care about your hotel then stay here for the food and location. If you are the least bit of a hotel snob, then stay somewhere else!;2
I stayed 6 nights with 2 friends in a double double room. The room was just big enough for us but there was nowhere to sit/relax except on the beds. The bathroom was a decent size with full bath, shower and usual amenities. There was a small cupboard for hanging coats which also housed a good-sized safe. We kept all our electricals (ipods etc) and documents in it no problem.   There was no tea/coffee making facilities or fridge which would've been nice, but the Tick Tock Diner is joined to the hotel, and there is a restaurant but we didn’t use it. The diner has a good range of food but a bit expensive. We did tend to use it for breakfast and late-night food because it was convenient.   The staff were wonderful and always happy and helpful. You had to show your room card at night;4
Every time I go to to NYC I end up staying at the New Yorker hotel and it's for a couple of good reasons: it's much cheaper compared to the other 4 stars hotels in Manhattan (even cheaper than 3 star hotels sometimes!) and it's so central: same street as the Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens and just a few blocks away from Times Square, the Public Library, Rockefeller Center and 5th Ave if you're are going to have some crazy shopping during your trip!  Also if you're lucky enough you can get great views from the rooms on the top floors, including landmarks like the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings.  The only glitch is that some rooms can be quite small, but if you're not spending much time at the hotel that shouldn't be an issue. Also internet is NOT included,;4
"During our stay we lived on the Wyndham New Yorker hotel in the middle of Manhattan. I was very excited to visit this hotel based on picture and information I`ve found on the Internet. When we arrived I was a bit confused. The hotel is rather old and not what I call ""up to date"". I was also a bit shocked about the fact that there was no ordinary breakfast restaurant at this hotel, only a small diner where you could buy traditional american dishes for breakfast. The placing of the hotel was rather good. Short way to the Times Square, Empire State building, Macys, different shopping etc. But due to the very high price, I was a bit dissapointed about the hotels condition on the inside.";3
I researched a lot of hotels before coming and luckily found this! The price was right/affordable with 2 queen beds and my AARP card--which allowed it to be cancelled with a refund if needed b/c I booked directly with them rather than a discount site-and my price was better! The hotel has and is being renovated. Mohamed checked us in, was extremely helpful and pleasant. We got a 35th floor room with a gorgeous view of the Empire State Building! We slept with the curtains open just to see it lit up so beautifully at night! The room and bathroom were both very clean, linens, carpet and furniture in great condition. The staff were unbelievably nice, polite, and eager to help. The Lobby had plenty of staff on hand to assist you, the concierge was very knowledgeable about Broadway;4
The staff is very friendly, the place is clean, they keep you luggage if the room is not ready and when your flight is late at night they can keep your luggage there while you visit. Our room was pefect. The lobby is fabulous. You are near a subway entrance and walking distance from a lot of activities,;5
I stayed here in 2010 and was going back to NYC as a party of 5 which included 2 teenagers. I chose the New Yorker again as I knew the location was good and it's a nice old style traditional hotel. I booked a suite which has 2 double beds and a double sofa bed. Upon arrival, I saw the hotel partially covered in scaffolding and I know they have been doing some refurbishments so if this would bother you ask when it will be taken down. Check in was easy, credit card needed to register and room keys given. Unfortunately, the 'lovely suite' they had for us was tatty, a bit smelly and had no view. I was disappointed as I recommended the hotel and the trip was for my Sister's Silver Wedding Anniversary but this room was below par. I went to reception and Krystle listened to my concerns;4
We were looking for a girls holiday for a few nights, flying from uk. Couldn't believe we could go to New York for 4 nights for under £500!  The location was so great, very central and walkable to all the touristy parts, couldn't fault it.  Just be aware as everyone else keeps saying that the room charge is $22 dollars per night per room, you have to pay upon checkout. No way round it.;5
We went down early Saturday am via train.  Got to the hotel and check in was great.  Fast, efficient & friendly.  After our long day, we each took a shower, with plenty of hot water.  Unfortunately (and maybe concernably) 20 minutes later, the smoke detector activated in our room due to the steam of the shower.  My question, why 20 minutes later after the last shower?  Everything was taken care of within a few minutes.  The rest of the stay was great.  The diner attached is a definite must visit.  Check out was great, and it was nice to be able to leave our baggage with the hotel while we went to the Rangers game.  Extremely convenient location to Penn Station.  Don't think the cost of the room was worth the size, even with my employee discount.  Would definitely stay here;4
Upon arrival we did not receive a warm a welcome.  We stayed for 7 nights and never felt welcome (the only people who actually said hi were the cleaners in the morning!) but it seemed to be a running theme in the city that everyone was extremely rude.  Check in and check out the staff were unfriendly and I felt like I was bothering them by asking checking in!  Tick Tock diner served good food with a few friendly staff.  Room and Bathroom were small but adequate for what we needed.  Facility fee is a joke (why not charge for use of the gym/ office rather than charge EVERYONE whether they use or not?).  Everything seemed like it was in need of a good refurb. Location brilliant.;3
Rooms are a little small though it had all the necessities you need. The TV remote worked intermittently during our stay, which probably is due to it's age.   The location however, was perfect. Walking distance to attractions like Times Square, and with many food options around. It is very central too, which made traveling about a breeze.;4
Four adults in room with two double beds.  Room was small, but clean and could accommodate us. We chose the most affordable room and it worked out well.  It's price point compared to other NYC hotels is really good and it's reliably clean. The location is great, right near Penn Station.  It's great if you are taking Amtrak in to NYC, and it's convenient for taking public transit around the city.  Staff are professional and friendly.  The bag check is great for early arrival and final day's stay after check out.  We ate at the Tick Tock for breakfast and got a decent quick breakfast.  There are a few good places around to grab quick eats.  We visited NYU and did some sight seeing so we didn't spend a whole lot of time at the hotel.;5
We travelled into NYC via train.  Staying at Wyndham New Yorker hotel was the best decision we could have made.  Excellent location, room was clean. Hotel staff pleasant and helpful. Security was fabulous.;5
We came to NYC for our son's wedding and arrived early to explore the city.  The hotel was conveniently located and walking distance to many of our destinations.  The staff was friendly, helpful, and made our stay there quite pleasant.  Rooms were clean but quite small, although I heard this is typical of Manhattan hotels.  Older building but well-maintained.  Tick Tock diner on site was a real treat to experience.   Our room was surprisingly quiet for being on such a busy street.   Wi-Fi was provided but it was very slow.I would stay here again if I wanted to be close to Penn Stations and the Theater district.;5
"There is no better place to stay in NYC!  We wanted a view and  Art Deco and did they deliver! From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed by Hector who kindly took care of our car and valises and Miguel who checked us in and gave excellent service from A to Z. I even passed by a couple days into our stay and Miguel  remembered me by name and ensured everything was excellent which it was. Now THAT is personalized service and impressive when the hotel's hundreds of room are full! Our room was glorious and provided a million dollar view ""Right through the very heart of it, New York, New York "", the worlds greatest metropolis. All amenities in room were perfect - comfy beds, great furnishings, lovely toiletries. The cleaning staff were very accommodating and did a fantastic";5
Room with queen size bed was super small - not much bigger than the bed. But I have to say the room did have all the essentials. Service was very good. Loved having the 24 hour diner connected to the hotel. Great location to Penn Station and subway.;4
Great location very close to many attractions and stores,  very good restaurant, free wifi at lobby and rooms, clean rooms with nice art deco design, great connection with the subway lines A C and E and Penn station.;5
We've reviewed this hotel on two other occasions... always giving it 5 stars.  And another 5 stars we give it again!  We travel as a family, and by far this is the best value for a reasonably priced suite we've found in the city, especially being so close to main attractions.  We had a GREAT corner room with TWO spectacular views of the city (Empire State Building out one side, and Madison Square Garden on the other). This time we made a visit to the lower level to check out the history exhibit of the hotel (displayed near the gym).  Fascinating! If you have a chance, check it out.  You're staying at a true piece of history when you book a room at The New Yorker!;5
Ask for room with view and higher floor - good hotel in a great location easy to walk to time square - empire state and not to far from  Grand Central and just round the corner from Pen Station.   Easy check in an managed to get a late check out till four as flight back to UK not till midnight. Room as on the small side but warm and fine for our needs as good central base to see all the sights.;5
Hotel is always busy and rooms were not available on arrival, despite arriving after hotel check in time of 2pm. Second room was not available till 5pm. Nor did we receive the rooms I had originally booked. Hotel upgraded use to the new Queen bed rooms with inter connecting door as we were a family of 4. I had originally booked a suite for the 4 of us in 2 double beds. I am not convinced we actually got an upgrade at all as the Queen rooms though nicely renovated are on the small size. 2 bathrooms a plus but no living area just to sit, I  hate hanging out on the beds.  You can not fault the hotel staff who are very friendly and always under the gun. The location is perfect to the subway and Penn Station and walking to the main tourist sites. We walked to 42nd street, saw a show;5
Excellent location, clean room and not too small by NYC hotel room standards. Clean, beautiful lobby, great staff. However.....a resort fee??? For a hotel room next to Penn Station?? And, it was unexpected - the website I used to book it did not mention a resort fee.  Also, bathrooms and showers need to be updated. Clean, but old and tired.   Not perfect, but I will stay there again.;3
"This hotel is ideally close to the Garden and Penn Station. The staff was welcoming and the room was clean. I was super impressed by the workout room. My only complaint was the ""smokey smell"" of the hallways.";4
Kind and courteous housekeeping staff -- especially a woman named Ana.  Very convenient location.;4
I have stayed here once a year for the past 5 years in March or April to attend an Exhibition at the Jacob Javits Center. It is very conveniently located, there are restaurants, shopping, a drug store right across the street. There is also a great bagel place about a block away.  I book the suite with one queen bed every year, and the front desk staff is great, and has given us the suite with 2 bathrooms one year when we had an extra guest with us. They can't guarantee early check in, so we had to book an extra night to be able to get into the room at 9 am this past year, but they can hold your luggage for you at $2 per bag, if that's all you need. The queen suite is spacious, clean, and has an updated bathroom. The mattress is very comfortable, and this past year they upgraded;4
fantastic hotel, great service ideal for tube,bus route and easy walking distance to main attractions, a diner onsite and also a quaint restaurant and bar attached to the hotel. lots of history in this hotel which can be seen in the downstairs area;5
We liked the location of the hotel, right next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Also, having plenty of small places to get food in the immediate vicinity makes it very convenient. Our room was bigger than we expected, and even had a little bit of a view. Some of the furniture if obviously a little older, but still good. What we did not like was that fact that there was no caulking around the bathtub. This just looks ugly, and is something that could be fixed in less than 5 minutes. Not sure why management does not care about this. Also, the three of us only had two sets of towels. Again, if you have a reservation for 3, it should be easy to prepare the room accordingly. To make matters worse, we called for more towels, but none were ever delivered. We picked some up;4
A beautiful sky scrapper property located at the heart of NYC. The property is located at just 2 mins distance from the famous Penn station, 5 mins from the mesmerizing empire states building and 2 Km from the happening Times square .  At first sight it seems a old heritage building (it is quite old) but as soon as you enter the lobby its a whole new World with world class amenities. A beautiful lobby awaits you as you behind the door. The building has loads of floor with each floor hosting 100 rooms which quite astonishing!!. We were given a room on the 23rd floor had a good enough view but felt a bit cramped for space but considering the count of rooms it had on the floor that could be understood. The staff is courteous and was quite supportive for the entire stay. The best;4
No problems. Few amnenities. This and other Wyndham properties offer litte in the way of movie/netflix alternatives. I used my tablet to watch Netflix.;4
This hotel was in the perfect location. We had a really nice stay and felt it was very clean and comfortable. The tick took cafe had to be the best part. We felt like we had been transported back in time. Would really recommend this hotel. We're able to sleep in the city that never sleeps!;4
We have just returned from 4 nights at the Wyndham New Yorker hotel. Lovely hotel, we were given a room on a renovated floor and the room was clean, tidy and everything you need for a base for exploring the city. It had a coffee machine in the room too which was great.  The only grumble I had was the $29 a day charge for wifi and use of the business and leisure facilities. Well we didn't use the business centre or fitness facilities so $29 a day for wifi was a cost we could have done without. They do tell you at check in about it so it's not sneakily done but as far as I'm aware it's compulsory so we didn't have a choice.  The location of the hotel is excellent, walking distance to everything. We have never been so tried exploring a city!! Madison Square Garden is opposite and;5
Great friendly service, the staff was always pleasant and friendly. A 10 minute walk to Times Square, Empire State, Herald Sq...Rooms were modern and clean. Highly recommend. Only downside was the traffic noise all night long;4
We stayed for 3 nights at the end of our honeymoon for some retail therapy 😃  Hotel is ideally suited for location to everything. 2 minute walk from penn station. 10 mins walk into the heart of time square.   All in all perfect place to lay your head after a new york shopping day 😃;5
I have just returned from New York and stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker. I can honestly say the hotel is tremendous  value for money and the location was perfect. It is not posh but extremely clean and friendly .Especially John the concierge who was very helpful and had time for people and always had a smile. Everything on hand and great food on site at the tick tock café open 24 hours . I would thoroughly recommend this hotel;5
Perfect location,  lovely staff,  clean, BUT shower was  at best poor and the $190 charge for facilities fee for a week  is a complete con !! We didn't use any of the facilities that they charge for. You have to pay it regardless. Unless you're up at daft o'clock you'll struggle to get in elevators,  in mornings especially. We had breakfast in tick tock every morning and it was adequate enough and friendly. Struggled to understand receptionist when we checked in as her English was poor. Grudged every cent of facilities fee;2
We loved this hotel. The location is great for tourists because is near to everything you want to see in NYC. You can walk to many places, such as Time Square, Empire State Building and the Madison Square Garden, and you can take the subway to everywhere else. Service was great since the moment we arrived.;4
Excellent location for all the best New York has to offer. Excellent service from the minute we arrived, from reception, security and cleaners. On arrival the room reserved wasn't quite ready so Mohamed on reception ensured we weren't left hanging round after a long flight and found us a great room with a great view. Thanks mate.  Rooms are small but comfortable. Definitely coming back soon;4
Very clean room and bathroom, excellent central location. No kettle to make tea in the room! Had to go to McDonald's across the road every morning! Tick-Tock Diner in bottom of hotel good food and value for money.  ***Booked through booking.com and when we arrived we were told we had to pay a COMPULSORY fee of 27 US dollars per room, per night for Wi-Fi, use of the business centre and gym, whether you wanted it or not. Not clear on our booking.*** Very disappointed. 😤;4
"Location is perfect. Such easy access to subway and trains. Lobby is attractive and busy! Paid extra for a view and got it on the 29th floor looking at the Chrysler Building. Not too much street noise except when window was cracked. Nice to have a room where the windows open. Room was very small to the point I was not sure where to open the two suitcases we had. Bed was definitely not a queen-size; at best it was a large-ish double. I booked a queen but did not want to move after seeing the view and the long line at check in and wasn't sure if this actually WAS their ""queen size."" Bathroom was ok but also small.I don't use much make up or product so the small shelf was okay but if you like a large counter top you won't get one.  Water changed from scalding hot to cold in an";3
My husband and I had to go to the city for business. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon. Krystle at the front desk was awesome. She made sure our accommodations were perfect. We arrived and my husband upgraded to a suite. My husband was not quite happy with the suite since the view was obstructed. Krystle was so accommodating and made sure we had the best suite in the house. The views were spectacular. All of the staff at the hotel was very friendly and the location of the hotel could not have been better. We will most definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and we will be back when we return to NYC.;5
Great place to stay if you will be traveling from Penn Station.  It's right across the street.  Lots of places to eat, great shopping and the best customer service.  Ask for Mohammad at the front desk.   He is kind, efficient and very helpful.;4
"The hotel is conveniently located and the lower floors are very clean and secure. The check-in process was very slow, however, and there was always a line and a wait. We were told our room would be ready by a certain time and then it was not; this happened three times. The room was small but comfortable; however, the bedrest/pillow smelled horribly. It was obvious that it had not been cleaned, which is a bit disgusting, especially when the high price of the room is considered.";3
My wife and I gave our kids a trip to NYC for Christmas, and we went this week (MA school vacation week). We had a great time and the staff at the New Yorker helped with that. The stay was great, rooms are clean and comfortable and the price was right. The rooms are small, but most rooms are in the city. The only issue we had was on our check out day, we received a call at 11:00 asking why we hadn't left yet (checkout is at noon). Apparently we were checked out erroneously. The clerk on the phone was a bit rude about this situation, but it was rectified and all was good in the end. Highly recommend this hotel.;4
The Pros:  Location was close to Penn Station.  Bed was comfortable. The windows open to cool off the room.  Security in the lobby checks for room keys at the elevator bay.  The Cons:  Bathrooms were old and the shower went from freezing to scalding hot every couple minutes.   Elevators took a very long time to come in the mornings.   a $25 Maintenance Fee?  Are you kidding me?  For wifi and a fitness center??  Who charges for wifi anymore?  I would never stay here again for that reason alone.;3
This was a great location to stay on a recent weekend in NYC.  My only complaints:  Mattresses were very, very firm. Sink in bathroom did not drain. Long wait time to check-in on a Saturday afternoon.  Otherwise, the hotel was clean and centrally located.  I'd stay there again.;4
I have stayed here many times and love the lobby. I think that Superman may come in at any minute.  I was sorry they redid the lobby bar. I loved the old world charm at Coopers Tavern. The Ruby Red Martini is a great bet.  The rooms are typically New York and the bathrooms are small. It is always clean if not getting a little worn. They are refurbishing rooms all of the time so I expect that will improve.  The security is very good and I always enjoy my stay.;4
I stayed here with my teenage daughter as her first trip to NY!  Someone had recommended this hotel to me however I was really disappointed:(  The hotel is out dated and over priced for what it provided!  The only thing it has going for it is that it is in an ideal location!;1
Stayed at the New Yorker for 4 nights.  Location was the key to this Hotel.  We were able to connect with the hop on hop off bus and walk to many of the main attractions.  The New Yorker was a Hotel to lay your head.  The room was very small and the bathroom was dated with very little moving room.  If it is a little bit of luxury you want you won't find it at the New Yorker but if you want s basic hotel in a central location the New Yorker is for you,;3
Great location. Tick tock diner served great food. Room average... Very small. Found that once we'd booked and came to pay for the room once arrived there were 'hidden charges' which we were not informed about upon quote and booking confirmation had been received. Over £400 additional cost for 5 nights. Discussed with the concierge desk who advised it was an error, but we would have to complain in writing. Sent an email upon check out and still had no response nor refund. Not impressed and wouldn't return!;2
Just a block from MSG Penn Station and walking distance to time square.  Easy access to subway and many places to eat and see. The price was reasonable for NYC. Had been asked several times to see room pass by security before entering elevators.  At first it was annoying but then my gf commented on how safe this made her feel.  I was happy to fish the room key out after that.  The shower pressure was incredible!!! Clean comfortable bed.  I would stay there again.;4
I have used the Wyndham New Yorker for many years and find it to be perfect for my visits to New York. The central location allows me to come up by train and walk from the station to the hotel. The proximity of the hotel to the garment district and broadway shows is ideal and it was easy to walk to Time Square and several areas of interest. If we chose not to walk, there was easy access to subway station on corner. I used the Tick Tock restaurant for breakfast each morning and found very pleasant atmosphere and friendly wait staff. I would definitely recommend it!;5
This hotel is the best for tourists, it is within a walking distance to a few attractions inlcuding Macys as I love my shopping. The breakfast area has a beautiful view of the city, you can see the statue of Liberty from there;4
"We stayed for a weekend break in NYC and enjoyed our trip.  Location: 34th St/8th Av, across the road from Madison Square Garden and a block from Penn station (easy access for the Amtrak trains), and there is a subway station just opposite the hotel.  Fantastic location - walking distance to the Empire State Building... and if you like walking, Times Square and Broadway aren't too far away (otherwise one subway stop).  There were renovations happening, so there were a lot of scaffolding structures on the pavement leading to the hotel.  Exterior: a beautiful Art Deco style hotel, and the ""Tick Tock"" diner is right on the corner with old-style furnishings and booths.  Lobby: spectacular and grand with an enormous chandelier!  Staff: prompt check-in, parents were given an upgraded";5
"I stayed here for two nights this week. Literally at the southwest corner of the hotel is the 34th St / Penn subway station. There was a very friendly and courteous doorman who was quick upon request to hail a cab for us. The lobby is enormous and beautiful, very comfortable atmosphere.  The check-in process could not be easier.  We were upgraded to room 724 from a single queen to a double queen. There are numerous elevators, each group assigned to service different blocks of floors; timely and spacious, barely a wait-time. The room was surprisingly roomy. The beds on the firm side but would not complain about it.  The TV is a flatscreen that is situated oddly within the room but again, we are not in NY to watch television.  There were two closets, a safe and a sitting area with";5
The location of this hotel is great. Located right across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. We walked to Time Square from the hotel and it was not that far. There are a lot of places to eat and shop right in the area.   Check in process was seemless, no waiting and friendly service. Security is very good at this hotel, no one is allowed to the elevators without a room key. The room was small. We traveled with 2 children so it was a little tight but it worked. The room was clean and the beds comfortable. I paid an upgrade fee for my room but not sure that I would do that again. The description said it was updated however the bathroom was very dated. We had no issues with hotel staff during our stay.  Tick Tock Diner is very convenient for breakfast as it is located in;4
"Not surprised by significantly small room, as that seems typical in NYC. But the condition could be better. The hot water handle on the sink came off, a lot of chips and cracks, the shower would go ice cold then scalding hot every few seconds. I paid extra for a ""view"" room which was nothing more than a view of the brick building next door. So disappointed.";3
The New Yorker hotel is a classic hotel. With all its pros and cons. Pros: great location, nice atmosphere ... it's living history. Cons: It's old, could use renovation, tiny rooms. Everything is clean though and the beds are comfortable. Bathrooms could use proper renovation. Still a good hotel if you get a decent price. Location is top.;4
The hotel was great. The room we had was large enough and very clean. Nights were noisy because we were in the city.  At the Trottoria Bianca Restaurant, the service we received was very slow and there were not many people in the restaurant. Went there twice and had two different servers.  Had to get the hostess to get our server both times.;5
I got a good deal and a wonderful room.  I loved the location and it has been a pleasent stay. I would come again.  The facilities were very nice and I especially liked the museum  about the history of this vintage art deco hotel.;5
Believe everything you read this charming hotel....I feel rested and nice comfortable rooms..The Service was excellent and the food was all very nice..We so enjoyed our stay there and i hope to return.....;5
They have a lot of rooms. Their hotel is not bad but the area especial the restaurants in from like Mc Donalds is so iffy. I arrived late and was so hungry so I have to cross there.  But the hotel in general is ok;3
"Stayed in-town for a convention at the Javitz, and its great because you can walk right down there quickly! The rooms on the other could be disappointing. The first room we were in was a tiny tiny box, with a ugly bathroom. We got switched the next day to a bigger room which was fine.  So beware of the room size... I would say ask for a bigger room if possible.. say ""i may have a third party, so we may need room for a rollaway bed"" The rooms are not anything nice, so remember that.. its no Dream or intercontinental.";3
This is my second time staying at the New Yorker Hotel.  The location is fantastic.. near everything I need: Starbucks, Shopping and Subway! We were also able to easily walk to the hotel from Penn Station.  We ended up parking in NJ and paid a lot less than we would have had we parked in the city. This was my first visit since the hotel has been operated by Wyndham. I didn't see any change, it was good the last time we visited, too. Amenities are nothing to rave over. The room was tiny (last time we lucked out and had a HUGE corner room), but we came to NYC to see the city, not a hotel room! Do be aware that the walls are paper thin, so if traveling with children, pack some earplugs. Great place with a ton of history! I will definitely be back!;4
Marvelous, central location in a heart of Manhattan. It is so easy to walk from here to so many of the iconic sights of New York such as the Empire State Building.  The staff was friendly,room comfortable (and quiet), service immaculate and the TickTock Diner served a true American feast. The hotel itself is a true icon with a colorful history, Tesla himself resided here for years. If you would like to immerse yourself into the true hustle and Bustle of New York, stay here and you will not be disappointed.;4
"Overall the service, room, restaurants and location were great. I only give the hotel an ""Average"" rating due to the beds. My wife and I received a room with 2 twin beds, no problem. The problem was that not one, but both beds had mattresses that were totally broken down, making sleeping uncomfortable. Both mattresses seems to have a metal band going around the perimeter, but as soon as you sat on the bed you almost sunk to the floor. Fortunately, we only stayed 2 nights, but those were some long nights. Not what I normally expect from a Wyndam property...The rooms are also small, but we did not spend too much time in the room, so that did not matter to us.";3
Stayed here from 9th April to 15th April. Nice hotel in a good location. Rooms a bit on the small side but adequate enough as only spent very little time in them. The security guys can be a bit intimidating when you want to go back to your room but just show your key card and the reception area gets very busy at times. We ate next door in Tick Tocks a few times which also gets busy at times too. All in all a good base for spending a week in New York.;4
"After visiting the Big Apple back in August and loving it so much I just had to return and this time bring the mother. We opted to book our travel and accommodation through Expedia.  On my previous stay in the city, I stayed in the Wellington Hotel which was rated less than the Wyndham New Yorker in all departments so I thought this hotel was going to be the real deal; how wrong was I?   Upon arriving we asked for an upgrade if there was anything available (at a fee of course, we were obviously wanting to pay for it). We were rudely told no and that there was nothing for the duration of our stay and when we asked if they had any king beds we were also rudely and aggressively told that they don't do king beds, only queen.    The main lobby was lovely but I couldn't say the same";2
The location is superb. Very close to Madison Square Gardens, subway stations and within walking distance to Times Square.  We travelled (3 adults and a child under 2) for a long weekend. The room, with two double beds and a crib, was of an adequate size. It is New York after all! We made the hotel aware upon booking that we needed a crib and it was provided no problems. The check in was smooth and room clean upon arrival (2pm).  We left our luggage at the hotel when we checked out and it cost $2 a piece. A bit cheeky when you have spent out on staying at the hotel and daily 'resort fees'. The hotel had wifi that was an ok speed for surfing and I managed to connect to Netflix one evening (when staying in babysitting!).  Overall a positive experience. I would recommend and stay;4
"Susie the concierge was amazing! We wanted to find a place in Manhattan that served crab legs. It took a little while but she found it, and it you have the chance, the ""city crab shack"" on 16th and 5th is amazing!";5
After reading some of the negative reviews about this hotel I was pleasantly surprised. The location is amazing, a few minutes from Penn Station and an easy 10 minutes walk from Times Square.  The rooms were comfortable with an iron, ironing board, safe and hair dryer.  The only reason not given 5* as the wardrobe space was extremely limited.  This didn't effect us but could be a problem for some visitors. Also had a place to leave bags until our flight.  $2 per case. Would definitely recommend.;4
"Recently stayed at the New Yorker with family and friends. Although the hotel is in a great location and it is a lovely historic building, the charges made were ridiculous! We were charged $25 per night for ""facilities"", business centre, fitness centre and local phone calls - woopie do! We had no need of any of the services, just another way to get money out of you, then to top it all, we had to pay $2 per piece of luggage to have it stored. I have stayed in a fair few hotels all over Europe and NEVER had to pay this. I even had to go in to the luggage room as they couldn't find mine. It isn't a cheap hotel to start with, but the extras made it too pricey to go again - such a greedy shame. The room was ok, but coffee making facilities would have been better. The bathrooms are";3
Was upgraded on arrival to the 35th floor. 4 adults (me & 3 adult kids) shared a room - more than comfortable in the room. Fabulous views over the Hudson River. No street noise facing this direction. Bed super comfy. Enjoyed watching the free TV with movies at night. Shower good. Good cupboard space for all our shopping purchases! Definitely got a good nights sleep after a hard day pounding the attractions of NYC. The location was superb, across the street from Penn Station where we got the Amtrak to Newark Airport. Couldn't have asked for better. This was my 4th trip to NYC and for location & comfort & price I would definitely come back to the New Yorker. Loved the Art Deco of the public areas and rooms - felt like a step back in time! Hope you enjoy and if you want big massive;5
This marvelous historic hotel with great service made it easy to get to all the NYC sites we wanted to see. Our room was small, but we didn't spend that much time there, so it didn't matter. Easy access to subway system. Short walk to Time Square and show theaters.;5
We arrived here on my 50th birthday and had put in our booking and had e mailed the hotel to ask if it would be possible to have a nice room with a view as it was my actual birthday. We arrived early morning as we had been on a cruise the week before and sailed into New York very early morning. Our room on arrival wasn't ready so we were invited to leave our cases where they would be securely stored in the hotel and told our room would be ready early afternoon. We then went out for a few hours sightseeing and returned around 3pm and told our room was ready. I expected to have a lovely room and maybe a bottle to celebrate with as I had read previous reviews on here where that had happened, unfortunately we got to our room which was really small, very dated and no bottle or;4
"I would have given this hotel a 5 rating except for the attempt to charge us an extra $22 plus tax a night ""facility fee"", when we had already paid in full through our travel agent. After I complained they removed it, but it left a sour taste in what had been a most enjoyable stay. Apart from that, the hotel is beautiful - but then I like deco. We had a large room with two comfortable double beds looking straight at the Empire State building down 34th St. The Tick Tock Diner is a delight, and we found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The central location is ideal for the tourist. We really enjoyed it, and we would stay here again.";4
I stayed at the New Yorker with my mum and two daughters, we were given a room that was a little small for four adult women so went to the desk to see if they could do anything for us and the wonderful woman on the desk found a bigger room with two bathrooms which was amazing.  All the staff were friendly and the hotel was clean.;5
"This is an excellent hotel, staff very pleasant, great location. It had been recommended to me and I was not disappointed. Will definitely stay here again when I return to the ""The Big Apple"" great value for money.";5
Hotel had everything we needed. The only downside was that there was a mouse in my sisters room and then ran into her 2 children's joining room. She rang down to reception in the middle of the night and got no answer. She had to get dressed and go down herself. The Manager took her to one side and said they would investigate. we were moving on next morning and was told that they would ring us. No phone call or apology.  My sister asked for a refund through out travel company but this was refused. She was offered a free nights stay in the hotel if she was to return, as if!!.;3
Arrived Monday April 11th to see David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. Got to the hotel about 10:30. Very nice lobby. We had a quick check-in and a miracle - our room was ready! Official check-in is at 3pm. I expected to leave our luggage with the bell captain for the day. We went right to our room, #2633.  Security was near the elevators, checking everyone's room key. The room was small but was recently renovated, everything in good order.  The bed was comfortable, bathroom was small but everything was updated. The view out the window was of the next tower, but hey, it's NY!  Best thing - the room with all fees and taxes was $205.   Location is just across the street from Madison Square Garden and just a few more blocks to Macy's and the Empire State Building. MSG was very nice, my 1st;4
"Hotel was clean and adequate with a reasonably comfortable bed and decor reminiscent of American Horror Story, Hotel (am I mixing up my art styles?).  In any event, I was ready to love this place.  Great, interesting architecture, good energy among the other guests, etc., but was quite surprised by the $25.00 daily ""Facility Fee"" that was tacked onto the price identified on the booking site that I used.    I am very aware of the steep fees and taxes that the City charges in connection with a hotel room.  However, those were always represented as ""hey, not our charges, the city imposes them,"" which I understand.  Looking to exploit the situation, it appears that many City hotels now charge a ""Facility Charge"" or similar add-on fee  -- for phone, gym, wifi, etc..- with no opt out,";3
Historic hotel. Clean, convenient, and central location. Very helpful staff. No complaints, other than valet parking a little steep at $60 a night, and add a tip each time the car is taken out :). Dris at the front desk was phenomenal. He made us feel very welcome and comfortable.;5
We came to see David Gilmour and this is conveniently located near Madison Square Garden. It's also accessible to Penn Station which we took a train from JFK and it worked out great. Staff is friendly, room was clean and taken care of everyday. They will ask for your room key every time you come back in but I think that is a good thing. Nice location and reasonable pricing compared to other places in the city.;5
Stayed two nights and were very happy with our stay.  Centrally located.  2 blocks from penn station and walking distance to other areas such as Chelsea and Rockefeller center.  Lobby could be a bit of a zoo but no problems checking in/out.  Also liked being able to store our bags several hours after checking out due to a late flight.  The rooms were clean and quiet.  CVS right next door was also super convenient for snacks or anything you may have forgotten.;5
"The hotel is conveniently located and the rooms are adequate for overnight stays. Chose a suite if you will be there for an extended period. The only issue I had was with the ""mandatory"" Facility Fee of $25 plus tax for each night which supposedly covers internet access and international calls, if you use them or not. I was able to have these charges removed, but that appears to be the exception. I feel that if it is a fixed add-on, it should be included in the advertised room rate, and not as a sneak-on adder.";3
Wyndham New Yorker did meet most of our expectations. Yes not large rooms but for 2 people ample space.  Small bathroom but sufficient for purpose, if a bit dated in the bathtub.  No iPod or MP3 facilities in our room but no matter we had kindles and I pad as well as phones.  Due to comments made by others I did pack an extension lead for recharging as well as a travel kettle as no in room facilities at all.  The sockets were actually easily located In our room but others not so lucky.     Decor is a bit dated but all in all ok for a 5 night stay. Check in was quick and easy, we had a small wait for our room but that was because we asked for room nearby our travelling companions, request sorted without issue.  The room was well serviced daily with plentiful supply of towels and;3
All I can  say is EXCELLENT!  Service, accommodations and old charm atmosphere were unbelievable.  The customer service of checking in is fast and friendly.  Especially having a 24 hour diner in the hotel is great.  The restaurant is superb.  The cleaning staff is polite and friendly.;5
Can't fault the location. Incredibly located to explore Manhattan. Everything is pretty much walking distance and for this reason alone I would stay here again.  The rooms and the service is adequate. Rooms are clean and comfortable. We stayed in a metro room which was decent sized. Bathrooms need some modernisation. There is a large turnover of guests so the front desk staff don't waste time smiling or being friendly. Expect short and tired responses.  John the concierge also tried to pull a fast one on me by trying to overcharge me for my shuttle at point of departure when the night before he'd confirmed a different rate!;4
This is in the ideal location for exploring NYC with Empire State, Madison Square and Broadway all a short walk.   Staff were friendly and helpful though it's a bit like being at Grand Central in the lobby!   Our room was more than acceptable but definitely a bit dated. That said, for city centre NY it didn't cost the world and was comfortable and clean.  There's a great diner - Tick Tock - attached which is perfect for breakfast and really popular. There's also a good Italian at the other side of the lobby which serves great food.   Given the price and location I'd stay again but it would be good to see the rooms being updated a little.;3
It had been 9 years since I last stayed at the New Yorker and I would definitely return.  Mohammed (sp) at the front desk hooked me up with a newly renovated room with two double beds (even though it was just me).  Great location.  Work out facility was very  nice.  Just on wifi a the gym was the only disappointment.;5
"Beautiful old hotel.  Really historical looking.  The hotel itself, the rooms, the hallways on the hotel room floors, the elevators, the floors in the lobby and the special entrance to the lower floor with other historical things; this is really a beautiful when you can keep the beauty of an historical look inside.  I don't usually go for the historical thing but was happy with this hotel.";4
Impressive lobby, check-in was quick but not very welcoming. Room was on the 22th floor,a bit small for the 4 of us (2 adults, 2 teenagers)  but this is New York after all. Bathroom was a bit small too but with nice historic details and a good shower, nice view of New York. Very close to Penn Station which was why we chose this location.;3
"I recently spent a weekend in the New Yorker hotel, in a ""room with a view"", however the view I had was very disappointing (picture attached). The room was tiny and the bathroom old and tired, with someone else's hairs remaining on the shower curtain!  It is not easy to order room service - a menu is not provided in the room, nor the number required to dial, so you have to go through the front desk each time. The food from the Diner is good, however on the final day of my stay I waited over an hour for my meal because the member of staff who took my order had written my room number down incorrectly and when it finally arrived it came with the incorrect bill.  To round off the stay, I found a large cockroach on the bathroom floor (picture attached).  For the amount that this";2
We had an amazing time in New York and the location of this hotel made the experience even better. We upgraded to a room with a view and it was worth the extra few dollars. New York is now my favorite city and i can wait to go back.;4
This hotel is centrally located for all the things you would want to do in NYC.  The staff was awesome and very attentive to all my requests.  The room was the perfect size for three people (even four) and the view was great.;5
Recently spent a night at the Wyndham New Yorker and the room was doable but mediocre at best. The rooms clearly need to be renovated. I can see where in past years this hotel may have been a high end hotel, but to me, it the room was just out dated and passable. I did not feel as though I was staying at a four star hotel. Beware of offers to valet park your car, it will cost you $75 per day, and you cannot leave and return. If you park your car yourself, you will save $35 per day.;3
Brilliant staff, very friendly and helpful. Location was fantastic with Times Square, Empire State Building, Madison Square Gardens and many shops including the biggest Macy's in the US all in walking distance! We were on floor 39 and the views of the city were spectacular and the room itself was clean and spacious. Would highly recommend and would stay here again without doubt!;5
From check-in to checkout this hotel was just perfect. We had a room with two double beds, as a party of three this worked fine, our room was on the 32nd floor and had views of Empire State and Madison square Garden. Staff were lovely very helpful and informative and brought us a coffee machine to our room when requested. We really couldn't fault this hotel at all, lovely clean room with comfortable beds,perfect for our five day sightseeing trip,would definitely recommend to anyone visiting this amazing city its so close to all the sights and Penn Station an absolute gem so glad we booked to stay here.;5
$400 a night for a room from 1960. Bathroom so small and bath looked like it was from 1950. Sheets felt like cardboard. Horrible hotel.How about management spending some money on your hotel for your guests.;1
Haven't even stayed at this hotel yet,but I had a few questions regarding my up coming booking. I sent an email the response was almost instant, Emily couldn't have been more helpful and the response I got was detailed and all my questions were answered. I also received a follow up email to make sure I had no more problems. Excellent customer service!;5
The location of your hotel is wonderful.  The Tic Tock restaurant attached to the hotel is great. The lobby is very welcoming. The rooms were clean and comfortable;5
Comfortable hotel in great location. Rooms are small but typical of updated historic NYC hotel. Single occupancy double bed and pillows were very comfortable. Small closet and adequate work desk in room. Bathroom adequate with tub/shower. Shower water alternates between very cold and very hot without warning...also typical of older, 30-floor hotels. Gym is adequate with barbells, machines, bikes, and treadmills. Clean facilities and friendly staff.;4
The room was smaller than my dining room at home, it wasn't very cleanly, they didn't even put a comforter or any blanket for that matter on the bed, just sheets!  They charged my debit card twice for the 2day rate as well as 200 more for a deposit I HAD ALREADY PAID IN CASH!!!!  I haven't received my refund on the deposit or the second charge for my room they say 5 business days but I have no clue what's going to happen with that and I don't know if they are going to reimburse the overdraft fees I encured due to there mess up!  Thee ONLY  good thing was the view of the Empire State Building;2
The hotel is location in a really good place - next to Madison Square Garden. The rooms were OK - average size, clean but very dated unless you love art deco?! However you only use the rooms as a base to sleep so that wasn't a problem for us. The lobby has a small take out coffee/pastries and the Tic Toc Diner is good. The $25 dollar a night fee when you arrive is a money making scheme by the Hotel. We were aware of it before we went - not really sure what you got for this mandatory fee- access to the tiny business suite and the small gym perhaps ?? You also have to pay $2 dollars for every bit of luggage you store once you have checked out !! This seems another money making scheme by the hotel. I must say though the staff were very nice and helpful. The only reason I haven't;3
Great location within walking distance of many attractions!  Our room was on the 36th floor and offered a gorgeous view of the Empire State Building and the top of the Chrysler Building.  Close to Macy's, Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and great restaurants.;5
If you are looking for a place to stay with a great location and aren't too worried about a smaller room then this is a good choice. Room had all the essentials including hair dryer and wifi but not much room for any activities other then sleeping! Room service very average. X;4
I took my sister to New York City for her 40th Birthday (a surprise trip) along with three of my cousins.  We stayed in the New Yorker Hotel for three nights.  This hotel is in an excellent location and it was one of a small few hotels that can accommodate five people to sleep in one room.  The hotel decor is a bit dated but aside from that the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. For the amount of time that we spent in our hotel it was overall a pleasant stay.  I would definitely stay here again for location and value for money.  The hotel is located right at Penn Station, Macy's Store, is very close to Empire State and is a 10 minute walk to Times Square.;4
Great central location and clean modern accommodation. Hotel had lovely interior design features nodding to the 1930's architecture. However we were stuck in a backroom with a view of walls and abandoned debris. We asked if we could swap rooms but were told this would not be a possibility. There was only a coffee machine in our room, no tea available. The coffee machine had no instructions and when I explained that I couldn't use it at reception, she asked me what I would like her to do about that!!! Rude. On top of this, the room was noisy at night with some air conditioning unit whirring or something- even if all controls were switched off. And there was only one thin duvet and it got cold at night. I didn/t get much sleep. Also we wanted to be able to access the skyline;2
It is such a terrible experience for me and my family as we have missing items after our stay at this hotel.   First one bracelet went missing which I left at my night stand. I thought I simply dropped somewhere did not think someone would steal it as I also have iPads charging in the room. But it would be too obvious to make an iPad or a bag disappear.  Then the day we are checking out my mom noticed one of her watches went missing then I started to think maybe this is too much for a coincidence reoccurring again.   I was going to make a complaint but my mom wanted to check her bag once again. As we could not find it, we simply called the hotel. I spoke to an agent from lost and found but the issue is there is nothing you can do.  I will never ever step into this hotel or let;1
I was nervous after reading other reviews, but my experience was great!  Easy check in, clean room, AMAZING view, convenient location, super nice staff, everything was great!  You can hear the noise of the city but it was part of experience and was nothing unexpected.;5
The hotel is in a fantastic place, we were just around the corner from the Empire State Building so we were extra lucky to be able to see the different lights at the top of the Empire State Building every evening!  The maids came and cleaned our room daily, she was lovely and liked to sing while she worked.  The staff in the entrance lobby were so friendly and immediately made us feel welcome!  They were always happy to answer any questions we had.  If you want somewhere to eat We recommend the IGK cafe that is just up the street from the Hotel, very reasonably priced and the food is nice too. Plus is does a good cup of tea.   Thank you to everyone from The New Yorker for a very memorable holiday :);5
Traveled to NYC for the Auto Show.  I have never stayed at this hotel, but it was close to the Javis Center.  And it was EXCELLENT!;5
We arrived early and stored our luggage until we could check in. The guy at the front desk told us to come back and check in at 2pm. When we came back, we were told that we had to wait half an hour for a room to be serviced. We did... But no room. We kept being told it would be ready shortly and waited an hour and 45 minutes, not checking in until 3:45. Staff were completely unapologetic despite wasting our time. We don't mind if check in is at 4pm, but don't tell us it's earlier and keep us waiting.   When we went to check out, a piece of paper had appeared under our door indicating they had charged us $27 for a processing fee each night we had stayed. When we asked what it was for, we were told it was Internet. So even though it says free wi fi, it's not. They actually charge;1
We went on an overnight trip (a concert at Madison Square Garden) and originally it was for the price that we chose the New Yorker.  The proximity to the Garden was GREAT!  Right across the street.  We were very impressed that the history of the hotel was kept.  There was quite a long line at check in but they made sure that there were plenty of front desk people available to make the wait was minimal as possible.  The room was small but impeccably clean.  They were doing some work outside our room on the 25th floor and it was a bit loud.  however, I feel that it is a small sacrifice for them wanting to keep the hotel updated.  Wherever we turned it seemed like they were cleaning.  Attention to that was evident!  All staff were friendly and we also enjoyed the diner and bar!  I;5
The Wyndham New Yorker Hotel is in a great place to explore the surrounding area of Manhattan. It is very close to transport links and some good amenities close by. The hotel is old and ornate, however the room although small was kept clean and well maintained. Madison square garden is over the road and there are some good Irish bars down 8th Ave just past the magnificent post office building. Macy`s and other shopping outlets are only a ten minute walk away. Overall a good stay and i would stay there again.;3
Worse hotel I have been with.  Very old rooms. Waited 45 minutes to check in and check out.  They charge 2$ for every bag you want to store while you are waiting for your room. No hotel I have ever went to, charged me for stored luggage.  That was the reason I even bother writing a review.  Stay away from this hotel. You can find better in the same area at the same prices.;1
Just got home this morning from New York. Fab holiday and we loved the New Yorker hotel! We had a lovely double room which was really big,always clean with fresh towels daily & the beds r so comfy,just what you need after a long day exploring New York. Staff were really friendly & helpful & the location was fab. Would definitely recommend this hotel & would stay here again.;5
We had an executive double room and it was large for a New York hotel room.  The beds were very comfortable and very clean.  The bathroom was very small and the shower was odd as you had to be physically in the shower to turn it on and of course the water was ice cold.  Loved the Tick Tock restaurant attached to the hotel.  Best pancakes around.;3
The hotel was reasonably priced and a great location if you are going to Madison Square Garden.  Typically sized rooms for a large city.  Bed was very comfortable.  Very nice gym and located near a lot of great restaurants.;5
Three night stay,  this hotel is in a great location near Penn Station,  very handy for the Subway and within walking distance of Time Square etc.  Check-in was a breeze,  we were given a room on the 36th floor.  The room was small but had a great view of the city and the Hudson River.  Bed very comfortable,  good storage space, TV and a decent bathroom.  The hotel has retained many features from the 30s,  lots of Art Deco features.  Sound insulation was pretty good but would recommend ear plugs to counter the odd inconsiderate guest etc.  No coffee in the room but a 24 hour diner,  which can be accessed from the lobby,  is handy.  Very good wifi and the room rate included free local and international calls.  Really enjoyed the hotel and would be happy to return.;5
Very very much people stay at this hotel. Long que when check in. The room was very small. WiFi works really bad. Room was not silent from the streetsound. When check out they debit a facility fee of 50 USD. I dont find any facilitys at all. On top floor they say it was a sky lounge. It was closed saturday and sundays. Hotel dont have any relaxing area at all. No, the pictures dont say the thruth. When go back i will never stay at this hotel again.;1
Great if you like the history or a bygone age spanning 1930's to present day. Highlight is room 2549 where my family stayed with photos of Mohammed Ali from the 60s and 70s when he stayed at the hotel. A 2 double bed + 1, 2 room suite plenty for my family of 5 with teenagers, bathroom a bit small, but, again fine if you don't all want to use it together. Love the art deco interior - a hub of activity in the centre of NYC with all amenities and sights within walking distance or take the Metro at Penn station 2 mins away. 911 sirens wailing away and large police presence add to the ambience! Not a fan of the separate charge of $29 per person for 'amenity' charge which is basically a charge for 'free' wi fi access. Tick Tock diner attached is not great, take a 5min walk for;4
Overall, an average stay in the hotel.  The location is great if you need to catch a train from Penn Station.  The room was a typical NYC hotel room, smallish, but ok for two people.  The only issue we had was that the bed was very uncomfortable.  There was a significant dip in the middle of the of bed, we didn't bother complaining because we were only going to be there one night. It did make for an uncomfortable sleeping night.  Additionally, the bed felt on the small side for a queen size bed, I would have thought it to be a double sized bed.  Other than that the service was fine. The hotel did have free wifi, which I had no problem connecting to, however my husband was never able to log on even after speaking with someone at the front desk.;3
I love this hotel , the only place I chose when I'm in NYC.  Perfect location, perfect service -front desk always goes out of their way to accommodate.  The rooms are always clean and fresh and beds provide a very restful sleep.  The Art Deco provides a  'must stay here' experience when you are in New York.;5
We stayed here as a family of 5. We stayed in a suite with 2 double beds and then another room attached with a sofa bed..room number  2030!  It was roomy enough for the 5 of us and had the added benefit of 2 bathrooms which was great as the bathrooms are very small!! We were 2 mins walk from Maddison square Gardens and Penn street metro. We could walk to time square and the Empire State building. We had read lots of good reviews and negative ones. The rooms were very clean and so were the bathrooms. There is no tea/ coffee making facility which is a pain, so take a travel kettle! There is a fridge though.Staff were very helpful and it is a busy hotel so you might have to wait to be seen!!! We would definitely return to this hotel. You are charged 27 dollars a day for;4
The hotel,when booking were really helpful especially cristine in reservations,once again thank you . The room was clean,tidy,cleaned daily,we were on the 7 floor,everybody was friendly,in the hotel and in tic tocs ,the breakfast was delicious . Hotel was very central for every thing,shops,bars,food,stations.;5
I will come back always! room is so big, clean and the location is the best. Close to Penn Station and right behind of Madison Square Garden.  Its so clean and the room is new.  I do recommend and i will come back soon.  I got all the items i bought online with no stress.  Only the wi fi was not good.;5
Great location close to Times Square and subway to get to other locations faster, fantastic views, helpful staff, the bathroom in the room looked dated but the room itself was cosy, welcoming and clean. Loved my stay and have recommended since.;5
We were greeted quickly and warmly as soon as we pulled up to the front.  Valet was easy, check-in was quick and easy, and the room was beautiful!  The happy hour was phenomenal and I will go back just to experience that again.;5
We arrived on a very busy Thursday evening and the hotel was full, however Miguel on front desk went to huge lengths to get us an upgrade to a newer and larger room involving the Manager and Hotel Director. Nothing was too much trouble and we were sent a complimentary bottle of Champagne to the room. The hotel is full of history and in the best spot for Time Square, boat trips, dining and is right next to Madison Gardens, walking distance of Central Park, Macys and the best of shopping. Miguel personally delivered the Champagne to the room, we were so impressed we bought a dozen doughnuts for the front desk staff who all greeted us by name. Get a more recently refurbished room if you can, the Tik Tok Diner is great for a breakfast, eat in or take away. Thanks to all the team;5
Beautiful old fashioned Art Deco hotel in a prime location. Staff super helpful, bed comfortable and yes, room a bit tight for space, but hey, you don't go to NYC to hang around your hotel room. Great value for money, no problem recommending.;4
Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights with 5 friends... We had a suite on one of the higher floors which was a great size and perfect for our needs. We also had a huge terrace which although we couldn't really enjoy as it was chilly, it was a lovely surprise with great views. The staff were friendly and the guys that worked overnight checking access to the lifts made us feel really safe (particularly with one of them kindly dealing with some unwanted attention towards on of my friends)!  Great location, with lots in walking distance... Also enjoyed the Tick Tock diner which was attached to the hotel..  Small downside is the size of the beds... Very comfortable but also very small!;4
the helpful friendly staff, the beautiful decor, the historic significance and the incredibly convenient location all made this hotel an amazing location from which to celebrate my birthday.  :) the view was outstanding, the room and bathroom were clean...it was WAY bigger than i had expected (a standard double-double).  And most importantly - not a bed bug in sight!!!;5
Spent three nights here with 3 kids.  Rooms were well appointed and we enjoyed the space of a suite.  The rooms were all clean and the hotel provided all you needed.  The location is excellent, in mid town and close to all the main areas visitors like to visit. I personally loved the Art Deco feel to this hotel. Also the TickTock diner is a must for a breakfast or 3 - you'll definitely put on few pounds.;5
Stayed here for 5 nights and was centrally located for all the main sights and close to bus stop for hop on hop off routes. We finally arrived at hotel about midnight after long day travelling and nearly as long on bus from JFK, tip if you can fly into Newark less traffic that route to city centre. We were upgraded to a room with a view looking at the Empire State Building and madison square Gardens, room had 2 large beds, 2 comfy chairs and desk. Not enough power outlets to charge electrical items, there were even 2 in bathroom. Bathroom was very small and dated but clean and lots of hot water and good water pressure. Diner next door good for brekkie though not cheap, but what is on NYC. Have to pay $2 per bag to leave after checkout and then another $2 to reclaim later. Most;3
Nice location but hotel looks quite dated. Rooms nice but very small. There are a lot of hidden charges that they add onto your bill such as a service fee for internet and other things which really should be included in the price. Fees such as this seem to me to be more of a scam. Wait time to get to the check in desk also took a long time with not enough people on.;2
"The hotel had about 40 floors located in a historic building. the standard room was nicely decorated and just big enough for one person. given the price i paid including tax and fee, i could not believe that there were several student groups could afford to stay at this hotel. one thing that annoyed me was that there was always someone standing by the elevator asking everyone to show their room keys. i don;t know if this is for security reasons or not. but the tone of voice of the person was rude and insulting. nonetheless, the hotel was in an excellent location with lots of restaurants and cafe.";4
rooms were small and a limited view.   location was great for travel by train. walking distance to nypenn. actually close to port authority as well. for those travelling by bus. subway entrances on corner. typical ny diner on ground floor.  a bistro on ground floor as well. felt safe. can walk to times square as well.;5
Hotel staff is very nice, clean room, and good atmosphere. We checked in before a concert and then took their recommendations on a place for dinner which was also very good. Highly recommend staying here.;5
I recently stayed 3 nights at this hotel and found the location to be fantastic! I took an upgrade for $15 per night to obtain a room on a higher floor and boy was it worth it, as when I looked out my window the Empire State Building was right in front of me..  The room was larger than I expected, especially for New York, of which I have stayed many times. It had everything I needed, a really good hair dryer/iron & ironing board and great wifi - a must for me when travelling on business. The staff at this hotel were lovely and I liked that when you were coming back into the hotel each person heading towards the lift were asked to show their room key - so for me good way to ensure only guests staying at the hotel were allowed up to the floors and when travelling alone is;4
"OMgosh, the best sheets ever!  I wanted to stay in bed, inside those starched magnificent sheets!  No problems for us, at all.  I adore historic hotels and this was the place!  The ""home"" of Inventor Tesla, his last 10 years.  Anyway, friendly staff, clean rooms, the price was right for NY.  Right in the heart of the city, for our purposes (tourists).  Adjacent to the Tick Tock, 24-hr. restaurant which serves REAL MILK SHAKES.    Upon check-in, the employee ""bumped"" us higher up and we had a pretty good view of the Hudson River.  I'll definitely stay here again, like this coming summer.  We had 2 double beds which ""enlarged"" our room somewhat and finding 2 beds in NY ain't easy.  I tried to get out of the $50 surcharge (we booked 3rd party), but no luck.  Have you read ""Heads in";5
An excellent hotel with a great location our room wasn't huge but was comfortable and sufficent as a base for us  . All staff were friendly and helpful . The Tick Tock diner is located on the ground floor of the hotel and is open 24 hours and has a varied menu. The subway system we found confusing even for the locals! We were asked for help by one of them .;4
This hotel is located a block away from Penn Station so it is very convenient in terms of getting around.  There is a great view of the Empire State building when you walk out the hotel.  The hotel itself is very large with maze like hallways.  The room was very small even for NYC.  It was a bit outdated, but overall an enjoyable stay for a list min one night stay.;4
Rooms were so small should have been informed prior to checking in got email day before to upgrade we did then when we got were not allowed too very disappointed;3
Room was nice but small and somewhat outdated. I was somewhat upset they charged $2 per bag to only keep it for a few hours after check-out! AND no room service! Would recommend Wyndham's TRYP hotel down the street. Much newer, bigger rooms, and friendly service.;3
Stayed here for three nights - great position In New York but rather dated and small. Stayed at Westin Grand Central two years ago and far better hotel. Bathroom very old not a great shower amazing view of Empire State Building. Security in hotel good and helpful staff;3
when in NYC you want to be in the centre of town and this hotel has definitely got the location, 2min walk from Macy's and 8 blocks roughly from times square.   On a map it looks fairly close to central park, it took us about 40min to walk it!   The hotel has free wifi, and offered to hold our bags as we get there before check in, so was able to drop them and go off into the city to explore.   The room itself was really quite dated, we had wall view! the elevators are like something out of the 1920s big brass buttons and many floors! so getting from the top to the bottom took a while when we kept stopping at each floor to pick up people. We were on floor 27 so was quite quiet. Having said all that we didnt spend much time in the hotel as we were out all day and evening, so i;3
The attached diner has had a total refurb making it bigger brighter but with the same friendly staff. Rooms are comfortable clean and safe (including a safe). Lobby security is standard. Rooms have a tv and ironing facilities though no drink facilities. The only down side was the service in the hotel restaurant. Though the bar staff were polite and pleasant some of the other staff had poor customer service attitude one even watching football on to whilst serving plates of food. One waitress made it clear she did not not want to be there. Tips were not optional they are automatically added otherwise she would have got nothing from me. My advice would be to avoid eating in the restaurant!;4
"I stay at the New Yorker Hotel several times a year. Every January, I ""live"" there for close to ten days. The hotel has been renovated over the past few years and the rooms are large and spacious. Several of the suites have balconies that overlook the city. The staff is incredibly helpful and the rooms are always spotless.  One of the selling points is the location. You are across the street from Penn Station and steps from several subway stations. The public transit line (bus) runs right down Eighth Avenue. If you are traveling to the City for business or pleasure, this location is perfect.";5
The hotel is very conveniently located 1 block from Penn station, USPS, Macy's and B&H Photo.  Lots of tour groups here so the lobby is always lively.  Gym is quite big and well equipped. Much better than many other Manhattan hotels.  Rooms are small but average for Manhattan... Toilet too close to wall making it a bit uncomfortable for those over 12 :)  Wifi free and good. 2 restaurants on premises. I tried Tik Tok, a diner type place. Good food and service.;4
After a long drive, I was welcomed graciously, and the service throughout the stay was top-notch!  The room ,and facilities were clean, and slick.  THANK YOU!;5
Lovely hotel, our room was a bit small though and a little dated. Still nice and clean with a good tv and safe. Well worth the price, great views of you have the right room.   Decent American diner on the ground floor if you want so good food without leaving the hotel.   Barely 10 minutes from Times Square and the Empire State Building as well. Highly recommended for a short break in New York as long as you're not to fussy about room decor.;4
Perfectly situated in midtown New York , friendly staff , comfortable accommodation, handy on site cafe style restaurant and regular Restaurant . The Hotel was refurbished to a good standard and had a wonderful history ! The security as we went to the lifts to access out room was comforting .;5
Stayed at the New Yorker for 5 nights! Great hotel! Spacious rooms, friendly staff and easy walking distance to everywhere. I have very high expectations and this hotel fulfilled every expectation. Free wifi, irons and ironing boards and hair dryers in every room. A great place for a city break.;5
The hotel is fine with a good location and our room was comfortable BUT it is the staff that makes this a really good hotel. Thank you to receptionist Carol for your kindness and professionalism. Your help during a difficult situation was kind, thoughtful and much appreciated. The management need to really value and hang onto such staff as Carol and I did take the time to tell them that.;4
Old, elegant hotel. Rooms with single bed small. Rooms with 2 beds adequate. Lacking for electrical outlets and space for toiletries in bathroom. Modern environmental units-can select heat/air conditioning at will. Not restricted by date. Staff was excellent. Rooms were kept clean.;4
The thing . that impressed me the most was your staff.They were helpful and courteousThey showed great respect for my military service;5
The New Yorker is a iconic hotel which is directly opposite Madison Sq Garden as well as close to Times Sq, Empire State, Central Station and Penn Station. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful but be aware of the compulsory resort fee ( I was but many are not). The rooms are small if having two doubles in there but are adequate. The bathrooms are small and tired but clean and functional. Would I visit again absolutely;4
"At first I thought it would be great to stay here for the ""iconic"" reason but bad idea. It's in such horrible conditions!! I stayed on the 34th floor to avoid street noise but everything can be heard because the windows are thin. The rooms are literally 10'x10' and paint cracked every where!! Then people are obviously smoking because it's coming through my vents!! My allergies are on level extremely high!! I'm so annoyed with the long lines for the front desk. I wanted to complain there but didn't want to wait at the line so I'm here venting!! The $25 ""resort fee"" is ridiculous!! The internet barely works and who makes calls anymore on regular phones?!!! Ridiculous to charge $250 a night without the taxes. Basically $300 a night now.  I do have to say the staff were nice. Just";1
i stayed with my family for 3 days, the hotel is old but i understand that it has several years. You have to pay a fee to use internet and call to anywhere, unlimited International free calls was good just if you are foreign. furthermore, you have a lots stores and places near. Good hotel;4
The good news.  Wifi is free.  The registration line was short.  They upgraded my room.  The room was big.  The location is close to the train station, bus station, and subway.  The bad news.  Parking is $60 per day. I forgot my  toothbrush before a meeting. I went to the front desk for a new one.  They told me they had them, but I needed to go to room and call room service. I left for the meeting unbrushed.  The bathroom was small and the toliet paper roll was akwardly place behind the door.  They had plastic water cups.  At night the room was cold. The bedspread was thin, and there were no extra blankets in the room.  In the morning, I was late for a meeting. I came down to check my bags but the line was 1/2 hour long. I walked 1 1/2 miles to my meeting with my bags. This was;3
Ultra small room and smaller bathroom. Good location, inexpensive, no issues other than wifi was so slow my email would not send.;3
We recently stated at Wydham New Yorker during our 1 week trip to New York. The hotel was approximately 45 mins from JFK airport. Uber cost approximately $65. The hotel is located on 8th and 34th- perfect location. From here you are able to walk to Macy's and penn station within 5 minutes and Times Square within 10. There are several food options around including McDonalds & Starbucks across the road, and an amazing bagel bar (on 35th). Both Duane Reid & CVS (pharmacies) are next door- also selling snacks and soft drinks. Most places around are open late, if not 24hrs.  The staff were very informative however beware- they will charge you a daily fee for phone use, wifi and gym access. We were told it was $26 per day but when we questioned this, it was quickly reduced it to $10.;4
I was only there so I dI'd not need to travel back to Eastern Long Island late at night and then return early morning. The room was small, but good price and I slept well. The staff was friendly and the front desk even gave me a drink coupon after being stuck in the check in line behind several buses of college students needing to check in. The staff was accommodating and friendly and helped make quick stay very nice.;5
This is a no nonsense hotel that knows how to look after its guests.  Everything is clean,efficient and works.  I expect a good bed, clean towels, sheets and carpet, this hotel always delivers.  They have state of the art Keurig Coffee machines and a clock.  Seems like every room has a good and unique view.  This time, I saw the river in the distance.  The staff are nice.  Most important, the rooms are quiet in busy NYC.  The plumbing works and the security seem to know who belongs in the hotel.  I been staying here for the last 20 years and will continue because of good value, quality and service.;5
Its the perfect location for my sales calls, right in the heart of the city.  I can easily walk or walk across the street to Penn Station.  Although the rooms are on the smaller side the staff is very nice and helpful.  I would recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.;4
We came from the UK to stay at the hotel for a family xmas in NYC and were very impressed by the hotel, our rooms had amazing views of the empire state building and the decor of our rooms and the foyer was very nicely and recently done up sympathetically in the art deco style of the hotel.    The large xmas tree and decorations equally added to the effect, which as xmas guests was lovely, we even on xmas eve had a visit to the childrens suite with a handmade wooden sign put onto their door for them with their names on, which I thought was a lovely touch.   Housekkeeping was excellent as was all service and nothing was too much trouble and we felt very well taken care of.   The only criticism I have of our entire stay would have to be the room service which I have to admit I;4
"The hotel was nice and well located. Staff were friendly and the room was clean. Price was relatively cheap for a nice hotel until they hit us with some bullcrap resort tax. On top of the city tax and some other tax, we ended up paying closer to double what the advertised price was. As my wife was pregnant at the time, we weren't really able to make use of the ""resort"" facilities they had available, which featured a business centre (so resorty) and a fitness centre (just what I look for in a resort). Wyndham New Yorker, lose the resort tax. You are not, and never will be, a resort. Cut it the f out.";3
Mohammad was very helpful at check in, made it possible for us to check in early by upgrading our room to a gorgeous executive suite on the 30th floor, the room was clean, comfortable and had a great view of Jersey. The staff was personable, always making eye contact, speaking regularly, even joking with everyone in our group. The staff made us feel very welcome, the hotel had a gorgeous old world feel to it!;5
Staff is was very nice and room service was great! It is also very convenient to Madison Square garden!  The hotel is very old and needs some major updating! Bathrooms were small and VERY outdated. Window in bathroom would not close but maintenance came and fixed it. Average hotel.;3
Arrived here on sunday 13th march for a 5 night stay. We had a junior suite withv2 double beds in one room plus sofa bed in the other. Really nice hotel. We had one bathroom could have done with another separate toilet as we were 5 but we managed. We had a room on 21st floor so had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. Hotel itself was very central to all we needed to see with a subway station just across the road. The rooms were lovely and clean with lovely crisp white sheets and white fluffy towels. Reception needed more seating areas as this was a very big hotel with lots of  people staying here. All in all we had a very good stay here .;4
I paid a good amount for a Queen Executive.  I didn't think it was worth it at all. The room was small compared with what I usually get for how much I paid. The bed was uncomfortable. The pillows felt as if they were inflated. The sheets were itchy. The bathroom sink was so small, there was water splashing everywhere. And finally, the hallway outside our room did not quiet down until 4 or 5 in morning.;1
Very busy hotel with ridiculous security. They are not friendly or pleasant and can be difficult when you want to enter the elevators. God help you if you do not meet their profiling standards. They will stop you and make you wish you were staying somewhere else which you will do after you stay there just once. I learn from my mistakes.....Do you?;1
Stayed in better hotels and stayed in much worse. This is a well used hotel and is clean, tidy and does what you need to it to do . It lacks lounge areas and good restaurants but is definitely suitable as a base to enjoy NYC. The value for money is very good and the staff are helpful .;4
I've stayed in many hotels in New York, and never felt less excited about one than this Wyndham New Yorker. it's a factory, not a hotel. I am with a group so it wasn't up to me wehre to stay but I wish I wasn't here. The city has sooo many cooler places even at this price. Yes, the Lobby is nice, and it's close to Madison Square Garden, but they hassle you for your key every time you go to your room like British school masters.. I don't know what they think they are preventing.. hotel security used to be smart, intuative, now they hassle everyone, three guys block your way to your room at times, always at least one making you show them a white piece of paper or key.. it's just dumb.  It's hack like a TSA inspection and not why people come to new york. why not use the money spent;2
Our stay was great! From reservations to front desk, each person that assist me plan this birthday trip for my boyfriend was super helpful and friendly. They even refrained from mentioning the room number to maintain the Tesla Room surprise for him! As a Tesla nerd, he was stoked just to be IN the New Yorker.....staying in room 3327 was the perfect gift!  The room was a tad small (considering the price) but as it IS Manhattan, it was to be expected and did not at all take away from the stay. The room was clean and comfortable with a view of Empire State. My boyfriend gave thumbs up to the deep tub in the bathroom too. We would definitely stay again and recommend!!;5
I have stayed at this hotel twice, the location is great for getting around the city, being close to Penn Station for subway access, as well as walking distance to Madison Square Garden, Times Square, Empire State.  The rooms are small, but sufficient, the hotel was clean, and the staff were friendly.  If you are after convenience without too much cost, this is the place.;4
If you can afford a better hotel, please do. I booked Wyndham because it was rated a 4 star and the price was relatively lower.  There was smell of weed on my floor, which was an executive floor. Requested for a floor change, though was upgraded to a bigger room with a direct view of the Empire State Building , however the experience with the smell of weed left a bad taste.;3
We had tickets to see Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden and wwere taking the train into Penn Station. Since I was just recovering from a back injury we wanted something close and this hotel was less than a block away. We loved the old New York feeling in the lobby but the long walk to our room and the size of room reminded us of what we didn't like about that old New York feeling. The room was clean but worn. Finding a place to plug in our phones was interesting when after crawling around my daughter realized an extension cord was being used for lamps and house phone. The room served it's purpose and I would stay there again if the price was right. There was a $25 room fee that I have no idea what was included. If it was the Internet it was a waste since we couldn't access it;3
Stayed here for 5 nights and on check in was told we have to pay $26 per night facilities charge . This is for wifi in hotel use of business facilities and the gym . What if you don't want to use the facilities . You still have to pay for it regardless . Not good if you are on a tight budget like myself . Only helpful person was the concierge . No tea or coffee facilities in room . Only decent thing about hotel is the location right by madison square gardens and empire state building . Would not return .;3
Great Staff..they were very helpful. The rooms were clean and spacious. it was sl farther then I like to stay from TIME SQUARE and my business meetings. It rained the days I was there and even getting a cab was difficult because of where I was. All in all it was a nice stay.;4
I am not a huge fan of NYC, so take this with a grain of salt. The hotel itslef was OK, not super fancy or luxurious. The location is very good if you want to be in the heart of things. I found the room to be quite small and a bit dated, especially the bathroom which made me feel like I was staying at a friends place.   A couple of things that got under my skin was the noise from the street and the thin walls. I could hear everything from the surrounding rooms, a bit of a pet peeve for me. The other thing was that there were not nearly enough outlets to plug in our things.   Anyhow, now that I know I may stay there again, but at least now I know.;3
We stayed here while in the city for a coffee show.  The rooms are very very small, but clean.  (Which seems to be the norm in NY).  The bathrooms are beyond tiny, and it only took us 3 days to figure out how to temper the shower and not get scalded.  And good luck finding an outlet to charge anything... They are few and far between.  You can tell there is history in this hotel though.  Our room had a lock on the inside of a closet door instead of the outside and our friends down the hall had 2 bathrooms. It was definitely a unique experience.  I would stay here again, but definitely going to ask for a corner room. They are twice as big.;3
Great location , very basic hotel , clean and warm , a little tired looking but as we were there to explore the city we didn't spend too much time in the room , would have liked tea and coffee making making facilities though!   Very difficult to get hold of once you've departed , we have lost our camera and have tried several ways to contact , but still waiting !!;3
I have had nothing less than outstanding experiences with this hotel. The accommodations, hospitality, management,  especially  Madeline has been great. With all the terrorist threats looming, I feel very secure with lobby security always being alert to suspicious  activity.  My number one hotel in NYC!;5
Room was clean and nice. Hotel was beautiful  with lots of character.  Staff was excellent.  Tick Tock diner wonderful.  Did not expect everything to be so nice for the very reasonable price of my room.  Great location.  Excellent service.  Would recommend New Yorker Rides for your transportation needs -- see Louis right in the lobby. Great for solo or family.  Will definitely go back.  Only negative was a slow-draining bathroom sink.;5
Hotel situated in good location with easy access to transport system and Times Square is a few blocks walk. We were given a tiny room in the old section of the hotel but rejected this and were upgraded to a newly refurbished room which was reasonable. Hotel was average. Breakfast is superb authentic American! Great! Restaurant in the hotel has superb meals on the menu.;3
Good hotel at prime location! Our room can see the Empire State Building!  Close to  Time Square, convenient to go uptown and downtown. Staff are extremely friendly.;4
The New Yorker a good hotel in a centralized location. The rooms had great views that allowed you to see the NYC Skyline clearly.;4
"Tiny room had neither coffee or ice close by . Room generally old and not attractive. ""Facility Fee"" merely added 25% to advertised low rate, quite misleading. Location is good for MSG, Times Sq Spend a bit more and enjoy your stay somewhere else!";1
We stayed for 5 nights from 3rd March on the 36th floor.  Room was not too big but quite adequate and comfortable - large closet and bathroom with bath and very powerful shower.  Shower head was not high enough for my 6' husband. We had two windows both with excellent views, one looking down to the Hudson River and the other looking north towards Times Square but this window was unfortunately always covered with condensation so couldn't really appreciate this view!  Would have appreciated tea/coffee making facilities in the room but an excellent location for exploring Manhattan and we very much enjoyed our stay.;4
Just stayed here again,,,,fourth time and it is always very nice. Great rooms,clean. Very good security staff. Nice bar/restaurant and a 24 hr diner..............Subway ,trains across the street. Walk 8 blocks to Port Authority for a bus.... Price is also very good and there is a nice gym.......I was looking out the window from my bed and can see the Empire State bldg. looking back at me,,the Chrysler bldg. is to the left.  Great place to start for walking NYC.........;5
Great location, clean rooms if small but only stayed 5 days and was sufficient. Rooms clean, great bathroom and has a TV and good bedding. Bed was huge , very comfortable and able to adjust room temperature.   New York its self is amazing, lots of places to eat and visit. We used the subways and booked some excursions.;4
We stayed in room 2550 for 1 night and could not believe how shabby the room was. For starters the bed was hard there was no coffee or tea making facilities which is a basic necessities in 2016. The bathroom is In Need of desperate repair as you can't take a bath without water leaking the seal around the bath is mouldy and had pubic hair around it and needs re-tiling there is no shabby chic about this hotel. Very disappointed tourists.;2
Love this hotel - central location close to Macys Times square Subway . Taxis are easy to get .   maids are excellent - great staff -  Great security ! Elevators always work quickly business centre and Gym are great no waits ! Great wifi connection .;5
First the problem we had. During our stay some of our belongings were missing. Not a lot of value but we decided to call security. In less than 5 minutes a manager came to our room. He was very professional, asked a lot of questions. He asked he same questions many times. I am sure he was double checking our story. He believed us so he said probably it was not necessary to check our belongings, but we agreed it was the best thing to do. We start opening our luggage and we end up finding everything. It was our mistake. We were all happy that the was not issue. He was a real professional. We found the most of the staff was very courteous. Now for the rest of the hotel. It is located in the fashion district very close to MSG and subway. The hotel is art deco and a little old. They;4
Perfect location very close to subway stations and Penn Station, walking distance to Empire State Building and several other sites. The rooms are small but the value for money is very good. Several good restaurants close by and 10/15 min walking from times square.;4
We appreciated the size and condition of the room, the friendly and helpful staff, the beautiful lobby,  the views from our windows, the comfortable beds, and location of this hotel.  We would definitely stay there again!;5
The rooms were great! The service was wonderful, we requested extra pillows at 11:30pm and they arrived with a smile. They made a three tiered 'towel cake for my daughter's 12th birthday, which was waiting for us when we arrived. It was a very nice gesture.;4
This is a good hotel it's being refurbished and it needs doing although it good it's showing it's age hence the work. Be aware we were on the 35th floor with a great view. The room was fine but dated. But here's the thing Monday to Friday there was constant drilling really loud drilling. Which started at 10am till 5pm.but this didn't really bother us as we were out mostly but if you wanted a late sleep in your going to be unlucky. Don't bother with the tick tick Dinner food was awful and over priced. But as I said the hotel is okay and we'll placed for everything.;3
Fantastic hotel in an excellent location. Our rooms were beautiful and spotlessly clean, with a stunning view of the Empire State Building. The rooms were also very quiet. Friendly & attentive staff. Would definitely recommend. Love the building too.;5
- good location near PennStation & Herald Square (A C E subway on the corner). - small rooms and old rugs. - great shower pressure, bathroom is average. - standard cleaning. - got this room with special Jetsetter price.  - friendly and helpful staff. - can leave luggage after check out for a 2 uds fee/bag.;4
Great location as it is close to Penn Station and subway. Friendly and helpful staff, rooms are not great but you are not in New York to stay in your room. The Tick Tock diner is attached and brilliant great stay would come back;5
The rooms weren't overly big or fancy when we stayed (I understand they have been remodelled since)but has a prime location near Madison Square, Penn station and other sights that are within walking distance if you don't mind walking to explore the city. A short cab ride from the Port Authority (bus,subway). Nice little reataurant/cafe attached. Times Square and 42nd street (busy commercial area near Times Square)not too far away. I was really impressed with the friendliness of the people of New York, not anything like they're made out to be. Loved the city,the people,the sights. Tip. Take a tour of the city (hop on ,hop off type)  We took City Lights 2 day tour but there are others and you can get these online or from street guys (they have traffic vests and ID, a lot on 42nd;4
"The location is great, you are in the  middle of everything. The staff was very professional and friendly. Mohammad at the registration counter was super. The internet was the only problem, but we were not there for the internet.  We were very satisfied and if in the area ""The New Yorker"" will be our future choice.";5
Room can best be described as dated, but it needs more than a fresh coat of paint as fittings are v old. We booked a double double room which sadly was not clean (hairs on/in the bath and dusty ledges) and have moved the furniture to get more room, as its v cramped and badly laid out. The room is simply not big enough for all the furniture.;3
Great hotel with great service! I hate to say it but the rooms are tiny but clean and the Queen size beds even seem smaller but the location beats it all! we were hardly even in the room with everything so close around this hotel you it won't matter that the rooms are so small. apparently this is normal for New York hotels. We didn't have a coffee maker so we asked at the front desk for one. They told us someone will be up right a way it sure wasn't right away but they brought a small keurig with a few bottles of water and a big variety of k cups and sugar and powder creamer, napkins, cups, etc.  All in all we were very pleased and would choose this hotel again!;5
I stay at the New Yorker every time I visit New York. I go about two or three times a year. The location is key and a great value for price paid. The staff is great, always helpful and knowledgeable about the area and helped greatly with directions on the subway. The rooms have always been clean and plenty of towels.;5
Stayed in a double room on the 8th floor. Great size to the room, much larger than a typical room in NYC. Bathroom was a little small but clean, def felt like these rooms have been remodeled recently (past 2yr). The bar downstairs is very friendly and welcoming for a quick drink before heading out! Front desk unfortunately is a little rude during check in, check out, any questions. Maybe thats just the style here? I'm from Texas so maybe i'm bias towards some southern hospitality. Overall for the money a good stay, 3.5 star style hotel. The location is great, easy to walk to MSG and several restaurants.;4
Overall a nothing bad to say. desk went above and beyond. Used my points so room was free and cant speak on the value. The guards at the elevators was quite annoying having to drop everything everytime to show I have a room key before I could pass him.  Good security reason but still irritated me with a young daughter doing the pee pee dance;3
The hotel is located next to Madison Square Garden. Just go outside, walk 2 steps, and see the Empire State Building down the street. Nice view.  MTR-entrance is directly next to TickTock-Diner. Hotspots and Landmarks also easily to explore by feet. Enjoy NYC!!;5
Booked this hotel based on location and wow has it got the location. It is two blocks from Empire State and seconds from Madison sq garden. It's about 15minutes walk to top of the rock, madam tassauds, theatre district, Times Square and many other great attractions in any directions and right opposite LIRR line or subway station. When we arrive Mohammed on the front desk surprised us by giving a comp up grade to the 36th floor which had been refurbed and had a great view of Empire State Building. Room was average size but knew in advance that rooms not big in NY so this certainly was not a down side. Besides we were there to sightsee so couldn't have cared if we had been in a broom cupboard but room was really clean and bed was very good after hard day of walking. The tick tick;5
Bathroom looks old and it is chipping. We found hair on the floor and in the bath tub. I have lived in NYC for 3yrs and returned for a mini vacation. The room size was fine for a hotel in NYC but the quality of the bathroom was very disappointing. I was in a standard metro hotel room on the 21 floor. Our friends also had the same complaints in their hotel room.  Service was great. Cleaners were very nice and prompt.;3
This hotel has been renovated and is now very comfortable. The location is is brilliant - near Macy's, Penn Station, short walk to Times Square. The reception staff were extremely helpful and eager to please.   The bedroom, whilst rather small for 2 people - there was nowhere to put the second suitcase - was clean and adequate for our short stay.  Quite honestly in New York you're out all day so it really is just somewhere to sleep at night.  The bed was quite comfortable but quite high - a bit tricky for a short person so I just had to take a running jump to get into it!! I love the location and will stay there again.;4
"A nice hotel with a very good location. About 30 seconds away from Madison Square Garden, awesome view over the Empire state and around 15 minutes walk to Times Square!   We were four people and paid 134$ per night for a room with two queen-sized beds that were very comfy. The room wasn't that big, so we were a bit tight but it wasn't too bad. The bathroom was nice and clean and the showers very hot (nice). There was no breakfast included and the ""hotel breakfast place"", (right next door, connected to the actual hotel), was ok. The WiFi in the room was actually pretty good, so we didn't have to go down to the lobby for once. Overall a good stay, even though it has a few things that could be better!";4
The location is top in terms of access to Amtrak, subways and Midtown.  The Hotel is priced right, which is why I stayed here for half a day while attending a conventional down the street.  At the end of the day, the staff is very nice, the room and furnishings are average for New York, but the hallways and overall rooms are just plain old.  I realize it's a very old building, but it served it's purpose well for my one day in the city.;3
Very nice room in the Wyndham New Yorker.  Great place to stay as we went to a concert at MSG and the location is excellent!  Recently renovated rooms, small but suits the purpose.  The bathroom not as updated but it was fine, hopefully they will redo the bathrooms at some point.  Beautiful view of the city!;5
Reasonably priced, historic hotel perfectly located in midtown. We had the cheapest room but it was clean and comfortable with gorgeous views of the city. The windows, which were the original ones, were a bit drafty in the bathroom but I kept the room warmer than I usually would (at 70 deg) and we were fine. We LOVED this hotel and plan to return.;5
The hotel and staff were great, both the location and the service.  The room was clean and well maintained.  However on the final day we received a bill for around $130 for 'facilities' which completely put a downer on the whole experience.  $130 for essentially using the internet for 5 days, as we did not use the gym or other facilities (which we were not offered or informed about).    Without this the experience would have been brilliant.;1
The New Yorker has great location, service and rate.  We had a room on the 37th floor with a great view of the city. Yes, the room was small but it was spotless and the bed was super cozy! The staff was friendly and attentive. We would definitely stay again. Also, be sure to check out the Tick Tock diner for breakfast and New York Pizza Suprema nearby.;5
I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. My boyfriend and I spent 2 days here and were not disappointed. It is a great location. One block away from Madison Square Garden, a short walk from Herald Square and about 10mins Times Square. There were some great restaurants nearby, 2 within the hotel, and stores such as CVS and Duane Reade close as well. The staff was friendly and the rooms were very clean! The room was a little small but it was perfect for the two of us. Great view as well!;5
Love the location of the New Yorker hotel ... Staff were very polite and helpful. The housekeepers were the sweetest  . Our room was very clean and the sheets smelled so good . We enjoyed our stay and will definitely return .;5
First off, this really is a historic hotel with an incredible story to tell, unique architecture and style that somehow feels New York even on the first visit to the city. The location is incredible: walking distance to Empire State Building, Times Square and Broadway (by European standards walking distance, at least). If that's not your thing, Penn Station is literally across the street with all sorts of local, long-distance and subway trains available as well as cabs, ubers and whatnot in abundance. The hotel itself is clean, the staff helpful and polite.  Now, the first time I checked in, I got one of their new corporate suites: up to date, nice and exactly what this sort of hotel should look like in my opinion. Unfortunately due to some plumbing issue (leaky shower), I was;3
Second stay at this Art Deco Hotel location is fantastic so convenient and a good base for exploring New York  Upgraded to refurbished room free of charge very nice room with modern shower and lots of room very clean and service good. Definitely stay here again. On site Tick Tock Dinner a great place to each;5
Good location friendly staff stayed in a few different rooms and they all have been good decent size, bathroom on the small side, nice warm rooms especially during the winter months. Bar attached to hotel is good too & the diner joint on is excellent for breakfast!;5
We booked in here at 4am because the hotel we were staying in was terrible. The staff were lovely and gave us a free room upgrade. We had a great corner room. Watch out for the the $25 per day charge for internet and phone calls though! The Tick Tock diner is great.;4
The perfect location to reside while visiting Manhattan! Sorry Uber and Taxi drivers, there is little to no need for you in this area!   This hotel is beautifully decorated and clean! A lot of historical figures have stayed here.;4
Location couldn't have been better for my needs. Room clean and comfortable, great view of Time Square. Internet connection was not consistent. Would have been nice to have a coffee maker in the room.;4
Great art nouveau historic hotel once owned by the Monnies, guests have included joe DiMaggio Mohamed Ali woody Herman etc room was lovely and staff superb, yes there is a 25 dollar service charge per day but most New York hotels so this thang! Loved this place, will return.;5
John was great sharing insight of the hotel. He toured us on the property! Tick tock dinner fast and delicious. I could see New Jersey past the river from my view. Great place for my birthday! Was given a gift which I really appreciated for my birthday. Couple of blocks from Empire State Building. Walking distance from Timesquare. Beside Madison Square Garden. Only 59.00 taxi fare from JFK airport. No complaints. Would prefer fridge and microwave in the rooms.;5
Decent location but don't be fooled by low room rates. You pay a $25 charge every day for the privilege of being in the hotel! So whatever your rate is add $25 a night min! Staff on the desk are rude and blunt. Not very helpful.  Rooms are small but clean. Gym is ok and Internet in the rooms but at $25 each day plus your room rate there are better places to stay for business and vacation as a regular visitor here;2
The staff is helpful, the rooms are clean, and the location so close to Penn Station is ideal for travelers.  It is also secure, as there is a hotel employee stationed at the elevators to ensure that only hotel guests have access to the floors of the hotel where the rooms are located.  A great value for too!;5
a nice hotel in a first class location.our room was very comfortable,but did not have any sort of view.very busy even in February.this was first visit to new york ,and wasn't sure what to take in the way of clothing,but found a ski type jacket bobble hat and a scarf,perfect,no need to take anything to smart.;4
We stayed in room 3042. 2/29/16-3/2/16. Had a good view. Was able to see clear into jersey. Got a free upgrade. So we could check in early. Only complaint was needed a better show head .. other than that. Would definitely stay again.;4
Hotel is very Central everyone was very pleasant rooms were clean however a bit small and could do with being updated the rooms are very dated the best thing is the location as you could go shopping and sightseeing and go back to the hotel for a rest and a cup of tea or just to drop off the heavy shopping.;3
It's been 20 years since I've been to NYC and we thought a trip could be cost-prohibitive. However, we took our two pre-teen kids to the city for a look around (their first trip). We found this hotel in our online research and were pleasantly surprised by the reasonable rates at its location across from Madison Square Garden. Could the favorable rates be affected by our visit being in February? This hotel may not fit our budget during a warmer season. Online photos show the exterior wrapped in construction scaffolding, but we were pleased that the interior is renovated and nicely appointed. The hotel has a long history in NYC, and has seen some rough times. But you wouldn't know it when you walk through the doors. We felt comfortable and happy with our choice.  The staff was;4
We stayed here for 3 nights, the central mid town location was perfect - a five minute walk from the Empire state building and walking distance to most places, but subway stop next door also. The twin room was a decent size with 2 queen size beds and the history and grandure of the hotel were compelling. A 24 hour diner in the lobby of the hotel was excellent and a great addition. If you like the Art Deco style you will love this hotel.;4
I got this hotel on Priceline for 75 bucks which is an absolute steal for NY for a 4 star hotel.  However, when I got there they said I had to pay a facility fee for 27 bucks or something which I thought was stupid.  They coldly said that Priceline should have let you know, which they didn't.  Anyway, the front desk man was very nice and gave me a two queen bed room, which is rare for NY and the room size wasn't huge but for NY it was.  The room looked like it hadn't been renovated since 1975.  I mean come on. Bathroom was gross.  Definitely not a 4 star hotel like the travel sites claim. But all in all, if it weren't for the good location across the street from Penn Station, this wouldn't be an ideal choice.  That and the upgrade is the reason I'm giving this a 3 star view.;3
Stayed here for Westminster 2016 (as overseas visitors). Room was a great size and had plenty of room for the roll away bed we needed. Speaking of the roll-away - by far the worst thing in the hotel - plastic, hard and very uncomfortable.  Rooms a little outdated but clean and tidy. We forgot to leave a tip for the maid the first morning and came back to the beds made (just) but pillows not picked up, no towels in bathroom and no toiletries. 2nd Morning we remembered and place was perfect when we got back in the evening.  Very close to Maddison Square Gardens. Starbucks and McDonalds over the road.;4
Stayed with my family for one week in Feb 16.  Location is everything for this place. Check in smooth and lowered the 27 dollar hotel fee to 15 dollars. 4 adults staying in the smallest room possible after being told at check in we had a spacious room with excellent views. Mmmm. Tic to diner is good value but there is a McDonald's and Starbucks literally across the road. We walked everywhere form this hotel and although the room was dated and cramped you only need the room to rest your head after a busy day sight seeing. Location made it worth it.;3
My sister and I shared a nicely appointed and relatively spacious room with 2 queen beds.  The bathroom was a bit drafty and had not been recently updated and could have benefited from more counter space.  We had an excellent lunch at the Trattoria Bianca.  Due to it's mid-town Manhattan location some rooms have traffic noise.  Request a quiet room to mitigate this issue.;5
Hotel very convenient, walking distance to many attractions.  Our room was of reasonable size, a bit dated and in need of some refurbishment.  Having said that beds very comfortable and clean, staff very friendly and helpfull, would recommend hotel to anyone going for a city break and would stay here again myself.;4
Stayed in the 38th and 40th Floors in Large Corner Suites, Great View, Large Room, 2 Full Bathrooms ideal, Pet Friendly for our two cats, adjoining bedroom with a Queen bed. Only negative was our Veranda was closed due to construction and noise from workers in the early morning each day in the Veranda.;4
I went to this hotel because I had unused rewards points that were about to expire through Wyndham, and I thought I would try it. Frankly, my experience with Wyndham hotels in upstate NY was terrible. So, I lowered my expectations. However, I found this hotel to be beautiful and the staff very customer oriented. I had requested an upgrade and ended up on the 30th floor. The room was great and I loved the decor.;5
Beware about staying at this property. They add new charges on top of a prepaid reservation. The clerk at the front desk has obviously dealt with many people like me who were surprised at the charge, so it is clear the company knows its marketing strategy involves deception and nevertheless stands by it. Also, after checking in, checking my reservation documents and such, and then calling the front dest to discuss, it is impossible to get anyone at the front desk and to get a return phone call.;1
Had a free night from Wyndham rewards that was going to expire so we decided to spend a night in NYC.  The room was small but newly refurbished and clean.  We were on the 8th floor, there was a view of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden from out window.  There was a kuerig coffee maker in the room.  The bathroom had a fully glass enclosed shower and was very pretty. The downside was the traffic noise.  Our room was facing 8th avenue off W.34th street.  Horns honking and police car sirens went on all night.  I would return.;4
The location is great, very close to Penn Station, MTA subway lines, Macys and other sites also a short walk to Times Square. The staff is friendly. Great security, you need to show your room key to use the elevators. No one can just walk into the hotel and go upstairs. They have the most comfortable beds and nice decor. The bathroom was large and very clean. I had a very reasonable price for my room considering it was NY. The Tick Tock Diner stays open 24 hours and the food and service is good.;5
"I stayed for a single night on the 40th floor in a west facing room - beautiful view!  This part of the hotel has not yet been renovated, but the room was clean and pleasant.  My room was small, but comfortable for single traveler. The lobby was always very busy and ""smoky"" for some reason - perhaps there is a ventilation or air intake issue.  Price was extremely affordable for the accommodation and location.  I would stay here again.";4
Hadn't been here since the 70s when the hotel was in serious decline. What a great surprise too check into such a warm, inviting space with a Tic Tock dinner attached. Friends had made the reservation and I was skeptical. So close to Penn station us a bonus. All the comforts of home and a wonderful lobby with speedy wifi. The room is ample. Adequately appointed. Wonderful, bright bathroom. Good water pressure. Toilet flushes smoothly. Separate rub and shower controls. Nice! Heading and air system is responsive. I love  this place. Subway tunnel is right outside the door. Heavily subscribed, so check-in, though friendly, may be slow.;5
To have dogs and people staying during Westminster, the stay couldn't have been more enjoyable with efficient service. The staff was extremely helpful and addressed everything we asked or needed during our stay. Room was lovely and clean. View was the best.;5
Little rooms, no space in double double room. Old shower, it's impossible to wash. No coffee maker, no refrigerator. Very small wardrobe, no space for closes. Long wait for Porter (40 min). Good location.;3
Beautiful hotel, nice rooms, super friendly staff! I love that they offer arrangements for parking our car. And it is so centrally located we walked almost everywhere we went. This was our third visit, and we will definitely be back!;5
This was our sixth visit to NYC and our fifth stay at the New Yorker hotel although our last stay was 11 years ago in 2005 when the hotel was owned by Ramada. On this occasion there were three of us, myself, my wife and my adult son so I booked 5 nights in a Metro double room. On our previous visits we have had a variety of rooms all of which have been reasonably spacious.   So to start with, we arrived in the afternoon after our flight from London, on previous visits, the bell-hop usually comes out with a luggage trolley and loads it up for you but not on this occasion probably because it was pouring with rain, still, no big deal. Check-in was fast as there was no queue and the friendly receptionist greeted us with a smile and gave us our room keys. Our room on this occasion;4
I have going to WKC since 2000 and very little has changed EXCEPT the cost. Rooms are tooooooo old & not cleaned well.;2
This was the best hotel I have every experienced. It was vary responsibly prices forit's style of rooms location and quality.;5
Excellent location.  Room was a little small but that is to be expected from a building built in 1929.  Otherwise everything was great.;5
Great location for Times Square and all amenities and all the top shows. Very good security you must show your room card before you can get the lifted. The rooms are good and clean and the people who comes in to make you room up are very good. The Tick Tock restaurant is brilliant but that's not apart of the hotel.;5
The room was adequate.  It was not one of the renovated rooms.....old carpeting and the original bathroom.;3
The staff was friendly, the service was quick, even when the check-in line was long. The room rates were great, and the view from 39th floor was amazing. I felt secure with the key monitoring at the elevators, too. The room was clean and well-kept, and the cleaning staff was very friendly. We'll be back!;5
Hey, the title says it all.  While the rooms are really small, they are also very nice, clean and comfortable.  The staff has always been friendly and helpful.  The location is right in the middle of everything Manhattan and since I like to take Amtrak to New York, the proximity between Penn Statiion and this hotel couldn't get any better.;5
I had a early check-in but the room was a closet.   I asked to be m9ved to a larger room, which I was and was pleased.;4
"Pros  Location: Brilliant location. Within walking distance of Times Square and all the flagship stores on Fifth Avenue. Metro right next to hotel. At the same time, the area where the hotel is not Times Square noisy.  Quality of Bathroom Amenities: The soap, shampoo and conditioner are of high quality.  Tick Tock Diner: Loved the hotel diner which is open 24hrs.  Room: Room was small but comfortable. Adequate number of hangars.   Cons:  Hidden ""Facility Fee"": Published fares are non-inclusive of an extra $25/day ""facility fee."" Given there are no facilities in the hotel, when I asked what this fee is for, I was informed it was for and I quote, ""premium Wi-Fi, domestic/international calling etc."" If the hotel wants to charge for the Wi-Fi, then please don't advertise free Wi-Fi.";2
"We arrived an hour before official check in but our room was ready for us. We had a room on 19th floor, lifts were fast, room was clean and the bedding was very comfy. We were never bothered by room maids but they did a great job. Hotel itself is very well located and has everything you would need near by. Overall we had a pleasant stay but the service ""resort fee"" lets the reputation down. For this fee I was suppose to be able to make international calls, well I tried a number of times using the instructions but kept getting a message saying the call could not connect. Wifi this was very week if worked at all, Our devices would say it was connected but when wanting to use it nothing would load, as soon as I switched over to 3G messages/emails came flying through. We were most";4
Small room. Major construction going on outside of my window. Outdated interior room. Bar downstairs was the best part of the hotel. Good location across from Madison Square Garden. Close to trains. Front desk checkin was fair. Not very personal. Security was around and checked for room keys in evening. I won't be back.;3
The only drawback was the room I had, was very small it was 2514. a queen size bed was about all that fit in this room. You got out of bed and the desk chair was right beside the bed... other than the room size, it was spotless, everything worked.;5
Stayed here in December a year back with my sister and love it. The rooms were warm and cleaned daily. Very spacious. Had a fantastic vie as we were so high up. Big double bed each.   5 min walk to Times Square. Great pizza take away right across the road is a must visit.   Asked for a kettle to be provided in the room but ended up getting a coffee machine. This wasn't a problem and was a Godsend after coming in from a cold night.   We didn't really have any dealings with any staff except on checking in and out, but they were very pleasant.   I wouldn't stay again only because I'd like to try somewhere different on my next visit. Couldn't fault the hotel at all. Very clean and adored the Art Deco.;4
I have stayed at the New Yorker for over 15+ times. I look forward to staying there when I travel to NYC. I always remark that it is good to be home. From the time you enter the lobby to check in until the time you check out the stay ensure that your needs are looked after. It is so refreshing to see all the familiar faces when I arrive. to me that speaks volumes as to how good a place it must be to work. Thanks again to all the staff who made my trip wonderful.;5
We stayed here from 23rd nov-30th Nov on the 38th floor with spectacular views of the Chrysler building, empire state building and Maddison square garden. Our stay was brilliant the room was spacious and skimming clean and any requests were promptly dealt with. The staff were lovely and friendly and I felt very safe and secure during my stay. The hotel is just a few minutes walk from macys and the empire state building which made it very easy to find our way around. The tic tok diner Downstairs was also very nice where we had a big breakfast the pancakes are huge. I can't speak highly enough of this hotel it made my first stay in new York just brilliant. There was myself husband mother and daughter and all loved the hotel. My daughter was 8 at the time and loved that there was a;5
Been 6 times now. Very clean. Nice and close to shops. They have now introduced a facility tax. Nothing on the web site Its yet another way of getting tax out of you. $25.00 a day plus yes tax. Beware this bumps your bill up Apparently its on expida web site    ALL BEWARE💰🔫;4
The lobby looks great. The staff is terrific. The restaurant serves a great breakfast. The elevators are fast. The bed was comfy.... Only thing that surprised me was how small the room was. Not much space. Closet small. No problem for a weekend stay. I think it might be cramped if you had a week there.;3
We had a fine experience at the Wyndham New Yorker. Although it is an older hotel, it has all of the amenities of a newer one. The service was excellent, from the front desk to the bag check. Security is tight and it's in a great location, accessible very easily from Penn Station/MSG. The rooms are a bit snug, but not the smallest I've seen in NYC and the room is clean. We were pleased with our choice;4
I recently returned from staying at the New Yorker for the Westminster Kennel Club show.  Presently, I am unable to walk because of a broken foot.  I have to say that everyone on the New Yorker staff--the doormen, valets, bellmen, front desk staff, security staff and even the General Manager who kept me from falling off my hands-free crutch, were exceptionally helpful and service-oriented.  We stayed in a renovated room, which was spacious enough to accommodate us, our dog, his crate and dog show gear, our luggage and my knee scooter.  The bathroom was tiny, but I managed it OK.  The room was clean, which is very important to me.  We ate in both hotel restaurants (the Trattoria and the Tic Tock Diner).  We found the food very good and reasonably priced considering the market.;5
Check in a night mare, other then that when you finally get to your room, I had an updated one it was nice and clean;3
I have stayed at this hotel for a number of years, attending the same annual event in NYC. The Tick Tock Diner has expanded during the last couple of years and is always busy, reasonable and open 24 hours for that quick eating experience.  We did notice one long time waiter had completely lost his cool on Monday morning which was unfortunate.  Also the Oatmeal on Tuesday morning was like water.  Hopefully they will get their quality back in their service.  Otherwise it was fine and convenient.  The room we had was smaller than in the past but was adequate one we were able to obtain a second suitcase rack. . Otherwise the Hotel continues to be efficient, clean, and welcoming.  I found the exercise room to be in good repair as was the business center.  Security was ever present;4
We checked into The New Yorker after a horrible stay at The Pennsylvania.  Our room was 100% nicer, the staff was great, loved the heated floors in the bathroom!;4
"For simplicity, this is a copy verbatim of the letter I sent to the General Manager after checkout. The management last night wanted to just say ""well, hotels have mice, we try. We moved you half naked at midnight, scared you.. Wasn't disruptive.""  Hello, After a long day in the city I was relaxing after a nice bath. I had not even gotten dressed yet, when I saw a mouse sitting atop my suitcase. This set a course of action in place which disrupted my night, embarrassed me, and made very uncomfortable. I requested first that someone come up as I feared it may have run into my suitcase. I also requested, as all my clothes were in my suitcase, that the person sent be female as I was in my room alone and scantily dressed. I received a call letting me know only men were available at";2
Our room was typically small but was updated, clean, and quiet as one might expect in New York City.  Would have been better for just one person, rather than two.  My wife required special needs and the staff was very pleasant, professional, and accommodating, upon each request.  Overall a very good stay.;5
I think the New Yorker will always hold a special place in my heart as when we were in New York my fiancé popped the question ! However the hotel itself was lovely. The security was good not allowing those into lifts without showing your card and all staff were always more than happy to help. The hotel was clean in all areas and I loved how they have kept some of the old school features of the hotel. It was a perfect location to be out of all the madness and relax of a night time but still only a do minutes walk to all the desirable shops and tourist attractions. When we return to New York I would 100% stay again. Thank you for an amazing and memorable stay.;4
our first time staying here, we got a room on the 7th floor . it was super clean, shower was spot on and soo awesome!. only complaint is people in room beside ours banging against wall every night for hrs  and smoking in bathroom blowing into vent came in our bathroom. over all it was a great experience.;5
Only complaint was that we stood in the check-in line for a long time before discovering Wyndham Rewards expedited check-in line. The latter should've been more prominent...;5
After looking at the hotel website before travelling, lets just say I was hugely disappointed on arrival.  The photos on the website are really quite deceptive.  Walking down the corridors to the room, I already didn't have a good feel about the place.  Despite the sign displayed outisde the hotel advertising a new look for the hotel, I failed to see where there had been any renovations.  The carpets where worn down and grubby looking and the walls were the same.  It was the same once we entered the room and the bathroom was not very clean, dust and hairs were visable.  The place definitely needs updating!  I was quite angry on arrival as my husband had honestly thought he'd booked a decent hotel, to the point that we considered booking another hotel, however we decided to spend;2
The Front Desk staff and Manager were very nice, professional and made me feel welcome as a valued guest at this hotel. The Trattoria Bianca has some of the best dinner meal specials with variety. The Italian Shepherd's Pie was absolutely delicious. During our business stay, we took advantage of many of the amenities. The New Yorker would be my number one choice when I return to visit NYC, based on prime location, classy hotel, good food and safety.;4
We stayed here as part of a lastminute.com package. Hotel is in a great location, just a short walk from the long island rail road and right next to Madison Square Garden. Hotel was perfectly clean and the service was good. Only downside were small rooms and what was sold to us as a king size felt more like a double, but hey you don't go to New York to sit in your room! The hotel is absolutely massive so it may feel impersonal to be one of hundreds of guests, but we didn't really mind. In need of a bit of a refresh but that seemed to be underway whilst we were there. Would stay again.;4
The hotel staff, bell hops, concierge, and maids were all fantastic. The valet parking was a nightmare.;4
The sheets were very scratchy and the pillows were lumpy. The room was very drafty and small. I drove and had the car parked, attendant said allow 45 to 1 hour for pickup. I called in plenty of time and it took them 1 1/2 hours to deliver. They said it would be there in 45 minutes! Car had small scratch on it.;2
Not at all what I expect from Wyndham Hotels. Very small room and even smaller bathroom. Upon entering our room I noticed that the smoke alarm was wrapped in plastic. I notified the front desk who sent two security guards who took pictures and said they would send someone to remove it. I removed it myself several hours later before going to sleep. Apparently my smoke free room wasn't for the previous guests.  I was never notified that I would be sharing this hotel with over 100 dogs. It seems the dog show was in town that weekend. I should have been told this when I booked the room and I would have booked somewhere else. Dogs in the lobby dogs in the elevators is not what I expected when paying that kind of money!;2
Stayed here for one night to meet friends for an evening in New York. The hotel is set up for volume and is obviously extremely convenient for Madison Square Garden, so gets a wide variety of clientele from tourists to show-goers to business conference people. Rooms could use some updating but the views from upper floors can be good. Unfortunately the night we were there the people in the next door room were having a major party, with at least half a dozen people clearly getting drunk, screaming and laughing, banging things around, TV volume turned up high, slamming doors. The walls are very thin so we could hear everything.  xThey did not stop until 3.30am and then we could hear them retching and coughing in the morning at 8am. Worst night's sleep I have had for a long time.;2
The building is old but the rooms are a nice size and seemed clean. I loved the suite it had 2 tvs which was awesome traveling with children. Its in a convenient location and the staff was nice. I would stay again.;4
On our final day of a 4 day break in New York.  The New Yorker is an excellent hotel for both location and service.  Staff in all areas including the restaurant, bar and tick-tock diner are extremely friendly and helpful.  Security near the room elevators provided that extra assurance which was appreciated. Rooms are clean and of a good size for a New York or London hotel and views, if as lucky as we were (see photo), are amazing 😄. Location is a big plus being 10 mins walk to Empire State Building or time square and just across the street from Penn station.  Overall would highly recommend.;5
Stayed here for the second time for business. Ideal location for quick access to all kinds of public transportation. Although it is a big property, the rooms are pretty nice and - for NY - quiet. The wifi is very fast!;4
Stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker for five days and had a great time the room was very comfortable and also kept very clean and we all slept well.The tick tock diner was very handy and also great food so we had a great start to the day every morning.The location of this hotel is excellent as it is a short stroll to the empire state building and just across the road from Madison square garden with Times square about ten minutes walk away.The subway for uptown or down town at Penn station is also right on the hotels doorstep.Great hotel and will stay here on our return to the big apple.;4
"The best thing about this hotel was the staff.  Each and every one was always helpful and greeted me with a smile.  The ""elevator monitor"" was appreciated for added security.  The concierge desk was always willing to help.  Check in was a bit slow.  Internet connection in the room was practically non-existent, in the lobby it was better.  As this is an OLD hotel, the windows were cold (middle of winter - to be expected) but convenient for storing yogurt, etc.  The bathrooms were small but had everything you needed.  The bed was very comfortable.  The housekeeping team was wonderful.  The location (near Madison Square Garden) was convenient for the Dog Show events we attended, and there is a subway stop directly under the hotel.  The Tick Tock Diner was OK.  Always busy there.";4
After getting delayed at the airport, we checked in at 2am and the staff were most helpful and caring for our tired children, they took us quickly to a lovely room on the 26th floor with a view over the Hudson.  The room was spacious for New York with two very comfortable double beds and a small but nice bathroom in art deco style.  Super location close to everything in midtown. Macy's around the corner, Madison Square Garden opposite. Great breakfast everyday in Tick Tock diner. Had nice cocktails in the lobby bar.;5
Location wise this is a superb hotel, close to Macy's and only 7 streets along to 42nd Street/Broadway.  My room was on the 27th floor, the room was cold and draftie, I could putting the heating on but it was so noisy that it kept me up one night.  The room was basic but clean.  I spent a lot of my time out and about so if you're looking for a lush pad this is not it.  The staff were friendly and incredibly helpful.  I'd go back there because of the location but nothing else. Remember to watch out for the facility fee at the end of your stay, it was $25 + Tax so worked out around an extra $110 for a 4 night stay.;3
The hotel staff was awesome! The location is great. I'm from NY & picked the New Yorker mainly cause of location & an awesome staff. You can walk almost every where or catxh any train line at Penn Station.;5
Road Scholar booked this hotel for me on the initial trip to Westminster Kennel Club Show. I could not have been happier with the accommodations and the location. The room was clean and comfortable and just the right size for my needs. The staff was friendly and efficient as well as courteous.;4
Aside from not having amenities of common standards to hotel across the country,  THIS hotels methods of unethical operations as ot pertains to erroneous charges to my credit card for room service and restaurant meals that were in fact never had or received to my credit card is despicable.  Needless to say that I will without fail dispute ALL charges made without warrant. I will NEVER recommend THIS hotel to any colleague or individual .  Completely annoyed, Dr. K'jerrel A. Smith, PhD;1
Stayed here for 5 nights it was great, good location nice room , free upgrade! Lovely friendly helpful staff.  The breakfast in the hotel was expensive, there was a nice restaurant close by at half the price and better food.  Would definitely stay here again xx;5
"Fortunately or unfortunately we were only able to stay one night.  I realize this is New York City, but it is not an inexpensive place to stay.  When we arrived, we checked in and when we got to our room, it was the size of a closet.  One double bed, and barely room to walk around it.  I was also traveling with a dog for a show, which they knew ahead of time.  A ""potty area"" was set up in the basement for the dogs, and the front desk was very anxious to take my money to use it, but not so anxious to open the room when it closed at 10:00 p.m., which was rediculous.  They did give us a larger room, so I have to give them credit for that, but I'm not sure why anyone would think a room that small would suite double occupancy.  We had a family emergency and had to leave the hotel";3
My stay at the Wyndham New Yorker was very pleasant. Although the hotel was very busy and the lobby was cold (record sub-zero temps outside, so their wasn't much they could do), the level of service was exceptional and the room was very nice. As busy as the hotel was and the streets outside, my room was amazingly quiet.  The location, right next to Madison Square Garden is right in the heart of Manhattan, a very easy walk to Times Square, Empire State....  Their computer had a glitch and accidentally double charged my credit card. At first, I was very frustrated and intended to leave a negative review. However, as soon as I let them know, I was quickly contacted by the Director of Operations. He was very apologetic, courteous and quickly refunded me the overcharge plus some;5
Stayed in the New Yorker hotel  , in shabby old room, with impolite staff, and dogs barking in the room next door at all hours!!! Will not recommend this hotel. Asked for late check out and was told it would be $150  for 5 extra hours! Do yourselves a favour and stay in hostel if you want this kind of room and service! Only rating two due to location  and that was generous! Good luck if you go to this hotel...;2
We stayed here as a couple for 3 days. Overall the hotel is very well maintained, the staff is very friendly and willing to help the customers. Our room was clean, the restroom was ok, the sink and the curtains were clean. We would stay here definitely again.;5
I stayed at this hotel last week for 3 nights. The customer service was second to none on check in, huge credit to Mohammed for making us feel so welcome and he upgraded our room for free as a birthday gift to us which was very generous. We had a stunning view of the Empire State Building and our room was very large with two big, comfy double beds. The location was spot on, opposite Madison Square Garden and a short walk to Fifth Avenue and Times Square. The lobby area and lifts were beautiful and very art deco period which we loved, there are two eating places attached onto the hotel on the ground floor. One is 'Tick Tock Diner' which served delicious food 24/7 and the prices & wait staff were great! The second was Bianca Trattoria which we had some fab cocktails in. Again the;4
We had a wonderful four night stay.  Everything was perfect.  I will definitely stay again.  Only thing that we has difficulty with was connection with the Internet . It disconnected and consistently asked us to reconnect with the wifi and wouldn't save the hotel password which was a little bit of a hassle but nothing we couldn't handle.  Wifi was free and that was wonderful;5
The hotel is dirty and rooms are outdated the staff is really nice and helpful but I would not recommend to another person;1
The location of the hotel is great, just opposite to the Penn Station. Walking distance to Macy for shopping, Empire State Building for a great view of the Big Apple if you like. And around 10 minutes walk to Time Square. If you want to take subway, definitely convenient as it is in Midtown Manhattan. You can have a lot of choices for food, no doubt. No matter fast food, e.g. McDonald's, or a coffee at Starbucks, or some restaurant to sit down and enjoy. The hotel also has a restaurant offering breakfast, but we didn't try. Back to the hotel itself, the lobby is very beautiful and the room is big compared with other hotels we live in Manhattan. A little bit old fashioned room but very clean. Staffs are friendly, no matter the counter staff or the room service staff. And the;4
Very unpleasant. The images placed online are very misleading. The rooms are tiny, bathroom is very old fashioned and lobby needs some major cleaning. Not to mention, my sheets had hair that did not belong to me nor my boyfriend. Seems like the housekeepers aren't doing their jobs very cautiously. I also had an incident in the lobby where as any other guest should go up to their room waiting in the elevator banks an employee,a middle aged African American lady, approached me. She asked me to pull out my state issued id as there were about 10 other people surrounding me. Then she also asked me to show her my hotel room key. This made me feel extremely uncomfortable because she did not asked anyone else for identification but me. Unprofessional much? I called the manager regarding;1
Beds, linens and towels were good quality. Maid service was excellent! Bathrooms need to be updated.;4
All of my stays at The New Yorker Hotel have been great experiences. I typically visit the hotel a few times a month. The staff members are pleasant and quite helpful. The guest rooms are always clean and inviting. The overall atmosphere in and around the hotel is lively and fun. Visit The New Yorker Hotel ... you won't be disappointed!;5
Stayed here December 2013 just reviewing now the hotel when we stayed it wasn't wyndham it was just the new yorker. The hotel is very clean very close to empire state building. It's location literally across the street from Penn Station is very convenient.  Quite a small bathroom we had a queen room the rooms are not very big but clean and comfortable and who goes to NYC to sit in the hotel room so for us this hotel was great,;4
"The Wyndham New Yorker has a lot going for it.  It's location literally across the street from Penn Station is very convenient.  The hotel has been renovated since I stayed here about ten years ago, with many of the old art deco features retained.  The lobby is especially nice.  The hotel also has an interesting history which you can read about in a exhibit.  My only complaint, and the reason for my rating, is that I was charged a mandatory $27 ""resort fee"" for services that I didn't use such as wi-fi.  I don't think this was disclosed when I made my reservation through a hotel booking website and had no option but to pay the fee.  I think the only way a mandatory resort fee can be justified is if it's at an actual resort, for example, in Hawaii, not in New York City.";3
I am partially sighted. Barry was ever so helpful to overcome my obstacles. My only problem was the hotel room is very dark and that it was very hard for myself as a partially sighted person to identify dark objects in this environment, for example furniture.;4
I took my grandson to New York for his 16th birthday. We enjoyed the weekend (from check in to departure). The service at this hotel was phenomenial. The view was excellent of the Hudson River and New York's skyline. The front desk clerk provided this room and request after the original room was smaller and no view. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. The hotel is in an excellent location. We were minutes from Madison Square Garden, Macy's, Garrett Popcorn, and New York Transportation Authority.  The restaurant was reasonably priced and great food (taste and selection). The hotel did not have a refrigerator or microwave (did not take away from the quality of the hotel). It would have been great to warm leftovers or to store beverages.  I am planning to return for;5
We stayed at the New Yorker because I wanted to be near the Javitz Center for a trade show in October of 2010. The staff was helpful, but the rooms were a little small. I'd stay here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.;3
Location excellent ,hotel very good bedroom small but adequate, Times Square  around the corner, Maces across the road if traveling there take the train from JFK its quicker and a lot cheaper. Used tour bus to get around and see all the attraction's.;4
We stayed here in Oct 2015. After previously staying at the San Carlos, we had decided we wanted a decent size hotel room like we had had previously, and booked the New Yorker executive double room. We got this at a good price considering the location and size of the room. It had 2 queen beds, and was a large room. Disappointed at the fact we had no real view apart from the back of the building, but that was a small inconvenience. The staff were very professional, but not warm and friendly. Nice location, McDonalds is just across the road (handy for a quick coffee and breakfast to take back to room!), and also a cinema and Five Guys is very close by as well. Duane Reade is just a hop away which was handy for the band aids I required for my blisters after all the walking I did!;5
We stayed here again in july and before we went we got an email saying they are changing to wydnham, we didn't like the hotel this time, it was different, grotty and not as nice smelling as usual :(..;3
I ask for a renovated room and the clerk was very happy to accommodate me with no extra charge. The bathroom is tiny but remind me to keep my diet going. Very clean and it was the first time a hotel left my towel hanging for the next day!!!;5
Lovely Hotel..Location is great . Near Penn Station and Times Square..Nice rooms and all the staff we encountered were excellent. Easy check in/check out. Only in NY for 2 nights so didnt spend a huge amount of time in the hotel . Did i mention location !!!! Recomended;4
"Made a last minute reservation at this amazingly located hotel. I mean ""amazing"" walking distance to subaway, shopping , bars and restaurants. The room was so comfy (and surprisingly big for NY hotel) the view was right up there with the customer service ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Thank you Cristina (who made my reservation) you did not disappoint!";5
One step into the lobby and you can feel the history at this landmark hotel. Built in 1929 it was a showcase then and is again after a restoration. Many rooms have wonderful views of the Empire State Building. The location near Penn Station is ideal for train traveler and Times Square and midtown are an easy walk.;4
everything worked gerat, the room needs a little refreshment, but it is very clean and safe. Location is perfect for sightseeing, hoping etc. Hells Kitchen in walking distance, mmhhhhhh. We had really a great time and very quiet sleep.;5
We stayed at the hotel at the end of January 2016 and were there for the big snow storm when Manhattan was virtually closed down and traffic barred. There was a very short line to book in and the lady on the desk kindly suggested that we would get a special room. It certainly was, situated at the top of the hotel with a large lounge and bedroom with an excellent full bathroom. There was a view of the river and the city. One of, or the oldest hotel in Manhattan, there is a small display of photographs through the ages. We were due to get the amtrak sleeper to Chicago and the Penn station was conveniently across the road. If you want a central hotel, this is the one to choose.;5
We visited New York last year as a family and the best thing about this hotel was having a family suite were we could all be together, as opposed to two rooms! Spacious room with two bathrooms meant plenty of room for the 5 of us. Love the iconic Art Deco feel running throughout The location is excellent, staff are extremely friendly and there is a great diner attached to the side of the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel and know people who have booked since our return. I wouldn't consider looking anywhere else!;5
We stayed for a week in this hotel. The room was clean and quiet, with AC,  flat screen TV, 2 queen size beds that made it very difficult to go from the door to the other side of the room.  The bathroom was tiny. Food at the restaurant was OK.  Located 10 min away from Penn Station and a few more minutes from Macy's, the location was perfect.  The only complain.... extremely pricy!!!!!!!!;4
Me and my husband recently stayed in this hotel for 6 nights.  We found the room to be dated but was very clean and spacious.  The bed was extremely comfortable which ensured we slept like a log after all our walking!  We found it to be very quiet in the room with no noise at all.  The hotel staff were always smiling and helpful, particularly the chambermaids. I would definitely recommend this hotel as it's very central.  The only downside is that there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room.;4
The room we received was a good size for New York, clean and well kept. We had a view of the city which was great. It's located on 8th and 34th across from Madison Square Garden, 10 minute walk to Times Square and 10 minutes to Bryant Park. It's central to Manhattan, easy to travel from on the subway. We walked everywhere though and found it perfectly located. The Tick Tock Diner is a real find too, great food at a reasonable price.;4
Great hotel 10 mins walk from Penn Station and Maddison Square garden .very clean hotel stayed one night here .very comfortable room with 2 queen size beds en-suite room with flat screen TVs .no coffee making facility . 2 restaurants tick tick 24 hour and Italian restaurant very good in both . For $2 per piece of luggage they will hold it for you when you check out to continue exploring if waiting for flights etc;5
Beautifull old fashioned hotel. Our room was lovely as were all the staff. Central to everywhere...shops..subways..places to see and food to eat. A great place to stay if you only want room only. Would deff stay there again.;5
A good sized room with a small bathroom.  Two queen beds, air con, flat screen and wi-fi. The hotel has undergone some refurbishment - our room was standard, had not been refurbished but was very good. The bathroom did need updating. Location is perfect and staff very friendly. The 'Tick Tock' diner is superb for breakfast - great French Toast. There is a daily fee for use of the wi fi and other amenities which is quite expensive - this will not feature as part of your nightly rate.;4
My daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights whilst making a weekend break to New York.  We didn't really use many of the facilities, because the idea of our trip to was see New York City.  However, the room was great - 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms!! The staff were all so friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again!;4
Awesome location at a great value. Right next Madison Square Garden and the garment distric. Rooms are kind of small. Staff are friendly. The hotel restuarant is open 24/7 and has a large variety of food.;5
Convienent midtown location @ 8th Ave & 34th St. Older art deco hotel, undergoing renovation. Good for one night.  Small, simple room for lower rate ($95), although I saw lower rates available the next day, which also was one day before I needed the room. I learned that rates vary by demand for the particular date(s) you want a room. I could not change the reservation because ir is prepaid. Also the bedding did not include a blanket.;4
Was very pleased, well friendly and clean, got a suite on the 38th floor with lovely City view. Walking distance of all the sights. Super good food and friendly Hotel. Will stay there again!!! Thanks to all the staff!!;4
My Room was very comfortable, all the things I needed to spoil myself. Not too far away from the shopping areas, with access to multiple Restaurants & multi cultural foods. Staff was friendly,  the lighting could have been a little brighter.;3
We had an awesome stay .The front desk helped to secure a room with great Wi-Fi for business and the room was great....;5
I stayed at the New Yorker for one night on a business trip. When I arrived I realized my reservation hadn't gone through - a dicey place to be in NYC - but this is where the fantastic service and great experience began! Mohammad at the front desk seamlessly booked me a (gorgeous) room and turned what could have been a stressful moment into the beginning of a restful night, with a beautiful view, before a long hard day of meetings. I remain SO grateful to him and will recommend this hotel because of my experience.   The hotel also has a beautiful lobby, cool deco decor and a restaurant/diner attached. Also, and I always note this when it's the case because it's truly critical information, the wifi is good.  Stay here!!!;5
Me and my partner stayed here for 4 nights last week and very much enjoyed it, the location is great for a city break maddison sq garden is across the Rd and lots of the NYC must do's such as empire state, rockafella, macys, time square and Broadway are just a 5-10 min walk away, we found the hotel and room very clean with a 1930s art deco feel to it, we found all the staff very helpful and polite the only negative point was the compulsory $22 a day charge for the facilities regardless of if u wanted to use them or not but seen as we had paid we made the most of the WiFi in the room and the unlimited international calls;5
Stayed here for 1 night due to it's attractive price and proximity to Penn Station. The location is great - we walked 20 minutes to Central Park, and 20 minutes down to Soho. When we arrived, the front desk told us we will be charged 25$ for the WiFi and gym. Once I showed him that information was not on my receipt, he waived the fees and also gave us a bigger room. Beds are comfortable and the hotel is connected to the Tik Tok Diner if you are hungry!;4
I stayed at the New Yorker while conducting business in New York. The reason I chose the hotel was its location. It was a walking distance or a somewhat short taxi ride to the places that I needed to be. Check-in was a breeze, I was hardly at the check-in counter for a minute before I had my room key and was on my way to my room. The check-in clerk was very efficient and courteous.  This was about the only very good thing about the hotel.	  There were supposed to be renovations which have taken place so I didn't expect to be greeted by old stale carpet smell when I got to my floor (I stayed on the 29th). Perhaps the renovations didn't include carpet replacement or deep cleaning. The furniture in the room looked OK. The room however didn't look 100% clean. I could see some debris;3
Nothing to recommend. Service was poor and staff was hostile, and the rooms were very shabby. Beds are small, there are few amenities, and nothing is very clean. Internet is slow. There really is nothing good about this place, and the paint was peeling all around the bathroom. For the money, you can do MUCH better.;2
Stayed here for a 2 day 50 th wedding anniversary. The hotel gave us an excellent room overlooking Madison square garden. They also provided us with a complimentary bottle of wine. The hotel staff and management were very attentive and efficient. The location was very good and we were able to walk to all attractions. If we come to New York again we will stay here again The hotel has a lot of history with celebs and politicians staying there. Go on the elevator to the basement to get the very interesting history of the hotel.u;5
It seemed a lot of people like us had paid for internet and free phone calls which is extra and you have to pay it. but until you moaned several times the hotel didnt fix it. The rooms need updating and the windows are very old so you can hear a lot of noise from the city that never sleeps. Cleaners were fantastic and very helpful. I wouldnt stay at the hotel again.;2
This was our first visit to New York, I read reviews on trip advisor and choose this hotel. On first impression of the hotel wow !!!!! Clean , friendly and very helpful, the room was very big with two double beds , and the view was fantastic, Empire State Building out of one window and Madison square garden out of the other. It's central to all the places you go to see and close to the subway with time square well with in walking distance. The room was always cleaned well and we always left a $2 tip. The tick toco dinner a winner for breakfast too and it's open 24/7.  Would stay here again loved it.;5
The New Yorker was the perfect hotel and location. The room was cozy and the view was great. Everything was in walking distance, too. The hotel restaurant: Trattoria Bianca was excellent and service was good! I would definitely come back!;4
First off the hotel is in a great location, just 2 minutes walk from Penn Station which is very handy if you are getting the train from Newark airport, which I would definitely advise doing as it's cheap and easy. It's also about a 10 minute walk from Times Square as its pretty much central to Manhattan, making it easy to get to any location.  The hotel is nice, done out in a 1920's art deco style with a big reception area. We had a standard metro room, which was a good size and had a view of the Empire State building. The room was cleaned everyday and our personal belongings were repsected and left where we had left them.  The only downside is the wifi, it's very hit and miss, some days I could log on and others I couldn't. But this should not put you off and I would definitely;4
Where do i start? Reading the reviews on here i was honestly quite scared that i was in for a terrible stay in New York. Boy was i wrong. The staff were great help. We got given our room cards for the lovely receptionist and we look on the card to find we are on the 37th floor. It got even better when we walked in to see the beauty of the empire state building from our window. The view alone was so beautiful i couldn't be more happy! The rooms were very clean and had no trouble at all with anything at all. The location is perfect being a sports fanatic this hotel was an easy choice. 2 minute walk from Madison Square Garden! The diner downstairs is also great. Great service and great food. Also go check out Jack Doyles pub just around the corner. Would stay again. Will stay again!;5
The location is situated about 50 metres from Penn Station, which made it extremely convenient. When I arrived, I was greeted by some excellent customer service by an Indian gentleman who advised that he had upgraded me to a room with a view.  When I accessed the room the view out of the window was with the Empire State Building in site, simply amazing. The room was probably one of the cleanest and modern locations I have ever stayed in (I thought that the quality of Hotel would decline in a major city like New York due to the small priced I paid for the room but clearly not!)  The rest of the emenities are excellent ranging from the wifi, baggage storage and gym facilities. I would recommend this location to anyone and I would have no hesitations in staying at this location;5
Traveled with a student group and the check in desk was a nightmare. The process took 2.5 hours starting at 245 pm and ending after 5! They were so incompetent. I finally had to take the check in for the entire group and then check for my students assigned rooms that stretched over 5 floors for 22 students. The chaperones were on a different floor. The hotel could not understand how that could be a problem. Two days into the trip, one of the girls room found cock roaches in the bed. My room was adequate, but the kids rooms were tiny. It was ok but not a good interaction with staff.;2
Stayed here for a week in September. The hotel is very central, close to the Empire State Building and a short walk from Time Square. The room was small, however it's what you would expect in a city and we spent most of our time out sightseeing, so  it was perfectly adequate for our stay. Overall, I couldn't fault anything about this hotel, the service or location. Would recommend and would stay here again.;5
We stayed here while assisting my daughter's move to New York City.  It is a great  location and very accessible to the subway system.  The staff is very helpful and courteous,. We would definitely stay here again.;4
My son and I stayed here during Unified Auditions for university theatre programs and the hotel was in the perfect location for that, with the studios being only 1/2 a block away.  It's also walking distance to Broadway and Times Square and close to many restaurants of all levels of dining. Multiple subway stations are only blocks away if you need to go further afield.  We arrived early but were able to get into our room almost right away.  The room was a bit small but we had a nice view, including the Chrysler building.  The shower had reasonable hot water and pressure.  Our room was free of noise from the hallway or adjoining rooms.  Beds were very comfortable.  Wi-Fi service was free but a bit spotty in the evenings.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.   There had been a;5
We stay here about once a month or so and have always had a great experience. Front desk team is first rate! To the point where they recognize me at check-in and welcome us back. Always been given rooms that are huge by NYC standards. And - the walls are thick so we aren't disturbed by neighbors or hallway activity - a rare benefit in NYC! Special shout out to Michael, the manager, who remembers us and greets us with a smile. Mohammed and Krystal went extra mile - even calling up to the room to make sure the view and accommodations were to our liking. Security at the hotel is present without being intrusive. The hotel is in a busy area so it's nice to know security is monitoring the lobby to ensure guests have an enjoyable experience. The lobby is busy with lots of energy;5
"I have stayed at the New Yorker many times. The one thing that always strikes me is how friendly and polite all of the employees are. Whether it is the housekeeper, concierge, security, front desk etc, everyone greets you with a smile and an attitude as if they really enjoy working there.  This is an old world hotel with the ""mood"" of the 40s, a step back in time. Beautiful old marble and decorative accents in the lobby. Don't expect contemporary appointments. Many rooms at this hotel are quite small. The size of the room I'm given directly corresponds to my enjoyment at this property. I was given a small room this six day trip. In the past, I've had larger rooms which typically generates a 4* experience. (And they know I'm a trip advisor reviewer! When I checked in they told me";3
The room was beautiful - remodeled, modern, elegant and cozy. The bathroom was gorgeous & stylish. We had Nespresso and water bottles in the room. The location is amazing, right near Time Square, Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. And Mohammed, the gentleman who checked me in, was courteous, friendly, and efficient!;5
The New Yorker is a solid hotel.  It is near many of Manhattan's tourist attractions but far enough a way that you get some peace and quite.  The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and roomy, and the gym (for NYC) is the best you can get in a hotel.  Be advised, you have to wait in a line to get your room.;5
Me and my boyfriend visited the newyork hotel the end of January.   Soon as I arrived I was happy with the room, small but had an amazing view photo what I have shared  Great location 5min walk to Macy's 10min to Empire State  10min to time square.  And across the road from Maddison square garden. We both went to see the basketball game as it a tick off the bucket list to do in newyork and what an amazing time we had.  Both not being basketball fans but the atmosphere was brilliant really made our  evening .  They have a stake house next to Madison square garden  Nick and Steph.  It can be pricey but you pay for what you get.  We went there on last day in newyork before we set off to leave for our flight   The worst part about staying here was we had no room service in the whole;3
"The Wyndham New Yorker is in a great location (essentially diagonally across from Penn Station, and the price (especially with the senior discount) was superb.  The rooms are a bit dated and basic, lacking in sufficient outlets at the desk to charge a computer and a phone simultaneously, though there were other outlets if you looked around.  My bathroom sink didn't drain properly and wasn't really fixed when I brought it to their attention (engineering tried, but didn't succeed).  And there was no information about the hotel and city in the room (I ask twice and was eventually told by the front desk that ""we don't do that anymore"").  Front desk staff were very welcoming and friendly.  All in all a good value in a fantastic location.  It's a 3-star hotel, which is what I paid";3
We were in town to see the Army-Navy basketball game at Madison Square Garden (which is basically across the street!!).  Then the blizzard hit and NYC received 26 inches of snow in one day! The mayor told NYC that everyone should go home.  Well, that was impossible for us and I wondered what would happen to hotel guests? Well, the New Yorker had it all planned.  They sent any employee home who needed to be at home and any employee who chose to stay was given food, lodging and extra money! The employees who stayed were fantastic. We always had everything we needed AND there are two restaurants inside the hotel that never closed.  There was a great feeling of camaraderie as we all got through it together -well fed and well rested.    I have two kids who go to college in NYC and;5
Great location  in Midtown West across from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, built in 1929 and huge - hundreds of rooms.  Staff was pleasant. Large lobby. Our room was old and  tiny but clean.  We were up high and in the rear so the room was surprisingly quiet. Construction facade outside -   my guess is that Wyndham just took it over and is planning a major renovation   - but is does not look like a prime high end Wyndham hotel just yet... Our main objection was to the Priceline rating at 4 stars.  I would say 2.5 perhaps 3, but we got a very good price ($82 per night plus tax and fees) so we were happy to be there. So if you can deal with a tiny room in an older hotel for a good price, the New Yorker may be for you.;3
Upon arriving at the New Yorker  we were greeted by the door man, we needed to park the car and it was easily taken care off by the hotel($60) for 24 hrs. Our room was upgraded for only $20 and we got a view of the Empire State Building! The rooms were small but very nice and clean. The best friends at a hotel are your doorman(valet) and the concierge, both did not disappoint! I would like to single out Hector at the valet desk, he went above and beyond! Thanks again Hector! We did not want to pay another fee for the car so we got it out and parked on the street(free on Sunday's!) across from the hotel( at Hectors suggestion)We were in NY for a trade show at the Javits center. the New Yorker is a great place to stay, the Garden is right next store, Javits center is 3 blocks;5
Firstly fly with virgin it was a great start to our trip! We have just returned from a four day stay at the newyorker hotel.  The location is perfect, the hotel is old but clean, we had the most comfortable bed, which trust me after a day in Newyork you will appreciate.  The only thing we would say is not a 4 star.  Nothing in the bathroom worked properly, we were charged $25 a day extra unknown facility fees?? So be prepared to have plenty of extra cash.  They said they had upgraded us, but we had already prepaid for a room with a view ,so very confused... The tick tock cafe attached to hotel has amazing food but be prepared for the 20% tip to add on your bill every time.  It's very expensive.. The resturant on the other side of the hotel is also expensive... In fact the whole;3
Great hotel within easy reach of all the main sites. Very helpful reception and assisted with special requests in the initial booking. Not a fantastic view from the room but we had 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms and as there is so much to see in New York we didn't spend that much time in the room anyway. Would recommend this hotel.;4
My stay at the New Yorker was excellent. The staff was very professional and friendly. The rooms was small, but I was here on business not to throw a party. I did appreciate the Tic Tock diner being open 24/7. Breakfast was very good. Scott, I owe you an apology. After you booked our ride back to the airport, we goofed on the time. However, you were so gracious and accommodating - making sure we made our flight. Thank you. John, I enjoyed visiting with you and learning more about the Tesla room and the rich history of the New Yorker. The location was perfect - easy access to just about anything you would need on a visit to NYC.;5
We stayed here the 2nd weekend in December.  We had a group of 4 and stayed in a room with 2 dbl beds. The picture online is a little deceiving..... Way smaller than we thought.  Enough room for the beds and a little space left over (the beds were comfy tho!). The bathroom was the smallest I ve seen in a hotel room. That being said and realizing it s New York City with space at a premium we enjoyed our stay here.  We had a great view of the Empire State Building. It s also in a great location. 10 minute walk to Rockefeller center, Macy's, and Time Square.  New York City at Christmas time is truly amazing. I would definitely stay here again.;5
I made a reservation with Wyndham for a recent stay but never received any type of confirmation.  I called about 6 weeks before and was repeatedly told that I did not have a reservation at this hotel or any Wyndham hotel in Manhattan.  I gave them my name over and over and spelled it out multiple times, gave them my credit card information, check in and out dates, and still nothing.   I was forced to start my hotel shopping over again and ended up booking the Courtyard by Marriott, which happened to be on the next block.  This was a major inconvenience of my time of having to search prices and locations all over again, but I really had no choice.    When I checked my credit card after the check in date, there was a $614.14 charge from the hotel.  I called the number provided,;1
After a very long trip, and getting slightly lost after getting off at Penn St (completely our fault as it's literally round the corner) we checked in with Mohammed. We had initially asked for a quiet, high floor room, of which Mohammed told us that non of these rooms had outside windows. They were apparantly all indoor facing. Mohammed was a little abrupt and told us we had booked a budget room and implied that we should take what we were given.. We did not book a budget room, we booked through a travel agent and the room was expensive. I would usually challenge this attitude, however exhausted from our trip from Liverpool, I literally gave up and accepted a room which I was told was the best they could offer. The room wasn't ready however so we took a seat in the bar. Now upon;3
Nice hotel and friendly staff, rooms are good but the bathrooms are just a little dated but very clean and well maintained.  What makes this hotel perfect is the location.  Slap bang in the middle of everything and right next to penn station.  Great little dinner underneath give it a try. Would happily stay again;4
"Stayed for 1 night in the ""Blizzard"" Room small but newly refurbished and comfortable and spotlessly clean. Bathroom more than adequate in size but Shower could be warmer Service from all staff first class--as many before have said outstanding central location. Only gripe is the ""Resort Fee"" of $27 per room is  payable in advance whether the service (phone @ business Center) is used or not!. Surely this could be changed tp pay only for the services actuall used !! Tick/Tock diner attached to the hotel great for Breakfast.";4
We were booked to stay four nights but ended up staying 6 as our flight home to the UK got cancelled twice due to the snowstorm that hit on the 22/23 January. The staff on reception were so helpful in arranging for us to stay on in the same room (which was lovely)for the 2 extra nights as we were very stressed about trying to get home and to have had to have moved room twice would have been horrible. The hotel is in a great location - about a 10 minute walk from Times Square and a block away from Macy's! The views from our room of the New York skyline were spectacular.  We didn't eat in the Brasserie but did eat in the 24 hour Tick Tock diner - the pancakes and breakfasts were really nice. Only 2 small issues - the bathroom was quite cold - there was no heating and the wifi;5
I didn't actually stay at this hotel, but I went to the Rocky Horror Picture Show 40th Anniversary convention here, which was the first Rocky Horror convention that I went to. I am a big Rocky Horror fan, and I had a great time here! I got to see a lot of Rocky Horror fans, including some people from my local shadowcast, The Zen Room! I also saw a lot of interesting panels, and the preshows that I saw were great and funny. I also got to meet Nell Campbell, who played Columbia in the movie! I can't wait for next year's convention in Providence, Rhode Island!;5
The room was much smaller than expected - the double bed just about fit in the room!! Having said that, we had a stunning view of the Empire State and Madison Square Garden. The room was clean, but absolutely freezing. the cold seeps through the old windows, we was using the window seal as a fridge! We did have A/C so slept with the heater on all night.   Walking distance to all tourist hot spots - Big Bus Tour stops right outside. Plenty of bars/restaurants/deli's/supermarkets around to get all that you need. The Tick tock cafe linked to the hotel was delicious - would recommend stopping there for breakfast!  Overall a great stay - would return in the spring/summer to not have to sleep in the freezing cold room!;4
The front desk staff were very good, especially Mohammed as he gave us a free upgrade to a great suite with amazing panoramic views of the city! We could see the empire statue building and Chrysler Building, also partial views of Times Square and the Hudson River, all from our room, this was particularly amazing during storm Jonas! Good location with plenty of food places nearby. Good wifi.;4
good stay, nice room, nice staff, filthy tiles in bathroom shower. took photos and cleaned it myself, it came off very easily;4
Based on expectations we expected a higher class of hotel in NY. The hotel room was very small compared to other hotels in America. It was also dated and could do with a revamp. Location was fine and easy access to all sites of NY;3
We checked in for 3 nights before our cruise the room was tiny  I spoke to samira on reception who was very friendly & welcoming & sorted out another room for us on the 25th floor which was massive & had fantastic views of the Empire State Building & Madison square garden , location of hotel is amazing so close to many places of interest  Would highly recommend this hotel;5
Spending such a short time in New York you want to make sure you are in the right location and this hotel was just brilliant!  Oh and the bed linen was divine!!!!!! The room was small but had everything we needed, and the whole point was that we just had a base to sleep in and spend the rest of the time sightseeing!;4
I booked the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel for our stay in New York based partially on the good reviews it received on TripAdvisor, but also due to the convenient location.  My adult son and I were in New York for several days for some much-needed leisure time, and we wanted to do as many things as possible within walking distance.  This hotel fit the bill perfectly.  Our trip started out horribly, when an accident at the NY airport injured my son and resulted in our first day in the city being spent at the hospital.   By the time we finally checked into the hotel it was hours after our plane landed in New York.  We were frustrated, tired, hungry, and my son was in pain from his accident.   As we checked in with the reception desk, we were assisted by a wonderful man named Mohammad.;5
When I arrived and checked-in I was told that I have to pay extra $ 27 per night for facilities, even if you are not using them.   If you have to pay for it why is it not incl. in the price? And the extra charged later at arrival?  So therefore I give a 3 and not 4.  Other disadvantage is that there is no refrigerator in the room.  Advantage: good location, beautiful view.;3
I wanted to stay near a performance venue.  This hotel also is very close to Penn Station.  The building is interesting, art deco with a huge lobby and convenient diner tucked into the corner.  The room was tiny and not inspiring.  I was impressed that they had enough elevators to make it easy to get up and down.  Front desk staff was plentiful and good, got me into my room way early.  This was adequate to needs but I was happy to leave when the time came.;3
I travel to New York on business once or twice a year and when I am there my typical hotel chains are sometimes not options due to price.  I was happy to see that the Wyndham was now running the New Yorker as I have had some nice vacations at Wyndham resorts outside the US.  I was able to book a rate I was happy with on line.  One of the best things about the New Yorker that grabbed me right away was the location.  It is just a block or two from Penn Station, across from Madison Square Garden and was not a very far walk to the Javits Center where I had a show to attend.  The service I received at the New Yorker was very good and I had pleasant interactions with all the staff.  There was a decent diner (Tic Toc) on prem, plus a McDonalds and Starbucks across the street for;4
I am not sure If i just ended up getting a horrible room because I price lined this hotel, but I got a double bed room for four people during New Years. First, the beds were a tad bit bigger than twin beds, smaller than fulls. My husband is a big guy so that it was very uncomfortable. What turned me off most about the hotel room was the bathrooms. They were disgusting. The toilet is a small, 1970's toilet. My husband and our friend joked that only one of their butt cheeks would fit on this. My husband isn't fat by any means, he's a body builder so he's buff. Second thing about the bathrooms, there isn't a space next to the sink (vanity). Its literally just the sink. So you can't put your makeup products/hair products, let alone get ready in the bathroom at all. The bathroom can;1
Great location!  We had a Triple room and double beds were very small - but ithad 3 bathrooms which was great. The decor is of a good standard. Staff are helpful - and the adjoining Diner (Tick-Tock) is amazing!;4
"You expect fees like state taxes, tourism fees (which btw are normally not supposed to be passed on to the customer) etc on your bill. You DON'T expect a 25.00 Plus Tax fee for being a customer.  Disclose this upfront - better yet build it in to your rates.  Furthermore - some people don't use the pool, fitness centre, business centre, etc... and wi-fi should be either included in the rate or charged at a minimal rate of around 10.00 a night. Charging a ""resort"" style fee thats not disclosed in the rate is underhanded and false advertising.  Charging ME for what are basics in a hotel is ridiculous.  To clarify - an advertised rate of 88 a night - turned out to be 130...!! 130!!!?? that's crazy. (that's just their room charges - no food or chosen services added). This hotel's";2
"I often choose the NEW YORKER HOTEL because it is across from NY Penn Station and on the subway lines to convenient parts of the city.  It is a booming hotel in that crowds of tourists seem always to be checking in and checking out; which makes it interesting and fun. Built to the high standards of pre-war construction, this classic Art Deco hotel remains worthy of its history.";5
This hotel is an excellent location - 12 min walk to the Empire State and Times Square. Next door to the Subway. 5 mins walk to Macys.   We had room 2139 which had a lovely view onto the Empire State Building.   Staff were helpful and very friendly. Rooms were cleaned daily.   Only complaint is the $25 per night facility fee. This covers use of the wifi in the room, calls and use of the business and fitness centre. The wifi was poor for at least 5 of our 6 night stay (slow, wouldn't load pages etc) that we resulted in using international roaming. We had no use for the business centre nor the fitness centre and as for making calls, we utilised this facility only to get our 'moneys worth'.   This was a really disappointing aspect of the hotel.   The restaurant next door, Tick;4
This was our first trip NYC and we wanted somewhere centrally located to many of the sites we wanted to see.  Wyndham New Yorker fit that need perfectly!  It was all we hoped for and more.  We stayed in an executive double room on the 8th floor.  There was plenty of space in the room, which was very clean and neatly decorated.  The bathroom/shower, while a bit small, was more than adequate for our needs as a family of three.  Beds were comfortable after a long days of sight-seeing. We loved the outlets/charging stations that were conveniently located around the room.  While I know that there are tons of restaurants in NYC, we loved the convenience of being able to grab a bit from the 24hr diner attached to hotel if we were pressed for time. From check in to check out the staff;5
It's exactly what you need for a weeks break in New York. It's price was good for what you got.  Yes the hotel is a little dated in some areas, but you are in New York! You only need the room to sleep and shower in. So for that, yes I would come back. It's in a great location. Madison square gardens across the road, Macy's on the other side. It is well situated to get from place to place!   My parents went to their diner they have on site and said it wasn't great and over priced. My partner and I found a great diner on 47th called Evergreen Diner, take a look. Good was great!   For our transport back to JFK when leaving it cost us $60. Due to there being no cabs available the hotel organised a limo to take us at not extra cost!  Fantastic stay and will be back! Great Christmas;5
We stayed here in December for 6 nights. The New Yorker was in a great location, perfect in fact, in the middle of everything and close to time square without all that madness!  Out room was small but comfortable and it was a little tired round the edges (bathroom) but nothing that I'd complain about as its an old hotel, we were higher up so the view was great. Tick Tock diner was fab, we had breakfast there every day and two evening meals, they do the best burger ever. Really handy to have that down stairs.  Only complaint was some of the staff were not that friendly to deal with at all. I'm especially angry at the extra costs. Due to a friend recently visiting New York we were told they take so much per night from your card for a room deposit and refunded at the end of the;3
We highly recommend this hotel the location is brilliant you are in walking distance of everything, time square is about a 10min walk away. You can get the subway to Central Park from penn station which is next to the tick tick diner.   You get wifi at the hotel which is in the lobby and your room.   The down side to this hotel is the room was on the small side and when we checked in they took $100 from us straight away! We did get this refunded on the last day.   We will return and stay at this hotel.  Thank you Kayleigh;5
I noticed that a number of people complained about the size of the rooms in their reviews.  I can only assume that they have never stayed in a hotel in New York City. (Especially near Time Square)  I have stayed at several hotels in the city and I can tell you that this hotel has similar size rooms as every other hotel.  The one difference is that this hotel is much nicer than most and it has a couple of restaurants in the Hotel.  It is very conveniently located to Time Square and the convention center.  Also, the rooms are very clean and comfortable.  In fact, the room I was in had a special thermostat for the Tile in the Bathroom.  This was awesome.  Nothing like stepping out of a shower to a warm tile floor when it is in the teens outside.    The best part of this hotel is;5
Me and my brother stayed here for 4 nights, my brother has special needs and everyone who worked there were great with him.  Hotel was comfortable and clean. Really enjoyed visiting the diner downstairs for breakfast, fantastic service, no waiting and the staff are very friendly. The hotel is located in a great area, working walking distance of the Empire State Building and Macy's  We Would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends .;5
The best thing about this property is the location and the lobby. Room was small, 2 full beds, with one tiny window. That wasn't an issue. However, I don't think the room had been dusted in months. There was dust on the walls and doors. The beds were clean but not comfortable. I'm glad we were there for only one night. The staff was amazingly pleasant. The Art Deco style was beautiful.;3
it was very good.  It was quick and easy, and as part of Wynham Rewards member, received an upgrade room at minimum cost.;5
Thank you John snr for sorting out our luggage problem you were a life saver.Having been given the wrong information 2 days before about leaving luggage after check out the older man on luggage was rude and unhelpful.Had airport shuttle booked in 6 hrs time but thank you to John snr on security he sorted it out for us.;4
I really don't know what people's problem is with this hotel, I really don't!! I arrived at the New Yorker on the 11th January 2016 and it was nothing but very positive as soon as I stepped through the doors.  For a busy hotel, I received a very smooth check in with Aniana! She was the most pleasant person that knows that a joke and a smile goes a long way with a customer!!   I was expecting a room on a low floor that didn't have that much of a view, but when I got to the room, I had the opposite - I had a room with a view of the Husdon River! I was in room 2081 and it was spotless! The room was far bigger than I thought it was going to be, as NYC is known for rooms that are a bit on the small side, but this room exceeded my expectations and more!   I have to give a big shout;5
Front desk was friendly and efficient, concierge help was spot on and security was comprehensive without being suffocating. Basic room was well appointed and clean. Could not ask more for moderately priced mid town room.;4
Be aware of the bate and switch.   The picture listed is beautiful, but they put me in a room that barely fit a mattress.  It had one electrical outlet, and when I plugged in my hair dryer, it blew.  I called, and they moved me into a fabulous room with amazing views of the city.  I loved this hotel, and would give it a great review, if they would stop using the old, worn out closets of rooms that aren't shown on the site.  It reeks of dishonesty.;3
At check-in, we were excited to learn we had received an upgrade.  Upon seeing the room, the excitement vanished.  Small does not begin to describe the room, even by NYC standards.  The mattresses sunk in the middle making it impossible for our family of four to sleep comfortably.  The sink design made it impossible to wash our hands without drenching our clothing.  And, at check-in, the only time our credit card was not in our possession, the card was compromised and used at another NYC hotel, necessitating the deactivation of our credit card while traveling out of town with our family. The hotel was unwilling to offer assistance, aside from one phone call asking for a few details, but no follow up or expression of concern, apology, or understanding for out difficulties.  We;1
Nice clean, decent hotel, would definitely use it again, located close enough to Times Square and Empire State Building!  We were on quite a high floor so it was nice and quiet, we had good views from the windows too!!  The Tick Tock Diner downstairs is handy too;4
Very small rooms and noisy hotel with traffic outside otherwise location was good right by Penn station not far from Time Square staff were helpful and restaurant on the premises was also a good place to eat Would perhaps stay somewhere else Ne t time though;3
My girlfriend and I plus two friends stayed at the Whydham for 4 nights leading up to New Year's Day. We got a suite with a bedroom with two double beds and a sofa bed in the lounge. It was a great size considering the hotel rooms in NYC. It was perfect for the four of us. The hotel is however an old hotel and the rooms need updating. You can hear people and the plumbing from the rooms next door but it's not too much of a bother because NYC is very loud anyway.  It is in a good position. It is walking distance to Times Square and opposite Maddison square garden. It's also located on 34th street which is a 10 min walk to the start of the high line which is a must for tourists traveling to New York. It takes you down to the meat packers district which is worth seeing.   We didn't;4
Location is perfect! Second stay! It was beautiful after Christmas and staff very helpful! Free wifi and safe. No tea making facilities. Bathroom has baths. Located next to train station and 2 minutes from Macy's! Great for tourists;4
"I am SHOCKED that this hotel could have so many favorable reviews on TripAdvisor. The hotel prides itself on its Art Deco architecture, but that just means that your bathroom hasn't been renovated since the 1920s. The rooms are extremely small (I've been in larger rooms in Europe) - case in point, I had about 10 inches between the edge of the bed and the media console. As I said before, the bathroom is extremely small, with chipping tiles and almost no counter space (we had a ledge of about 4"" deep to store toiletries). Yes, the location is convenient, but expect more noise as a result (but this is nearly unavoidable in NYC) and panhandlers in the lobby. We also didn't appreciate hassle with having your hotel card looked at every time you enter since there are no card readers in";2
Stayed in this hotel in a trip with my parents. Just on 8th Avenue this amazing sky scraper hotel makes you soak up the NYC atmosphere. Great location near Penn Station, Madison Square Gardens and the Empire State visible from my bedroom window and a five minute walk. Lots of great things close by and in this great city all you want to do is walk around and Times Square / Broadway is less than 15 minutes walking away. Great little pancake store adjacent to the hotel .;5
Excellent staff and service.  Rooms were very clean.  Beds comfy but small no Kings in this hotel and the Queen seemed like a full.  Room very small.  I would definitely return because the staff was great locations excellent and even the two choices of food on site were good.;4
The New Yorker is a great hotel. It's Art Deco charm and historical background are a reason to stay there. The tasteful upgrades and remodeling that have been done since it's reopening are a reason to keep coming back. The rooms are clean, the staff is great, and you can't beat the location. You barely have to walk out of the doors to get to Penn Station. That allows you to get anywhere around the 5 boroughs with ease. If shopping is your thing, the cross street is 34th. Just start walking. I will continue to stay at the New Yorker whenever I visit NYC.;5
My daughter and myself stayed at the Wyndham 4-9th December 15. It was my treat for her 40th birthday.  First impressions of the hotel was a bit disappointing as there was a lot of scaffolding around the lower floors but once inside the foyer it was lovely, A beautiful art deco hotel. Check in took a while but I guess a lot of fights from all over arrived at the same time. We were dealt with and given our room details etc. I had requested a room with a view if possible and was very pleased to see we looked down 5th Avenue straight to the Empire State building. The room was not overly large but I was prepared for this. Bathroom was a bit small but all perfectly adequate. The furnishing was good and the bed very comfortable.The houskeeping for the room was spot on. The staff were;4
I visited the Wyndham the weekend before Christmas.   I had initially booked for my husband and I through booking.com but given an issue with his work, my brother came with me instead. Booking.com wouldn't help me so I emailed the hotel to explain we needed to change our booking and Madeline who replied was more than happy to help and was an absolute pleasure to speak with which meant something that could have been really stressful super easy.  We arrived after a long day travelling and we decided to book one of the airport shuttle taxis - it was cheap enough but was an absolute nightmare - we were only the second stop but it still took 2 hours to get from the airport to our hotel because of traffic (nightmare in manhatten!) - we got the airtrain back which we wish we'd done;5
If you enjoy beauty more than superficial luxury, this is the place to go. Also the  staff is absolutely very forthcoming, helpful and friendly. Free wifi, great! Beautiful genuine art deco styling. Every detail is beautiful. Big yet friendly and hospitable lobby. Lovely styled restaurant Tick Tock and there too, friendly and helpful staff. If you need to stay in the neighborhood of Times Square, Penn station, look no further.;5
Old hotel built 1929. Recently updated. Room small but adequate. No fridge but ice freely available  no coffee in room but can get machine and coffee and tea can be ordered at reception. Quite room as high up.  Staff efficient and all requests attended to quickly and efficiently. Would recommend;4
Very friendly staff, clean room and close to times square.  A fantastic art deco hotel.  The metro rooms are small but nearly all rooms in NYC are small so don't be put off by this. Lovely comfortable beds.;5
I like the location of the hotel which is why I use it when I'm in NYC but it could be vastly improved. I book via Expedia and am an 'Elite' member which should give preferential treatment and upgrades to hotels that are part of the Expedia  'VIP' booking program (which the New Yorker does). However, when I arrived, the front desk staff had no record of my status and were not at all interested in contacting Expedia to rectify the situation and so gave me an old, dark and basic room little bigger than a prison cell! After spending a while on the phone to Expedia, they corrected their mistake and instructed the hotel to give me the room that I should have had. The better rooms at the hotel are OK but the attitude of the front desk staff leaves a great deal to be desired!;2
The Wyndham New Yorker is located just 2 blocks from Maceys, 1 block from Madison Square Garden and with subway stations on both its corners. It is an old-style, classic looking hotel which has been re-furbished in traditional taste and I think they've done a good job of it. Plenty of lifts and a quaint though busy foyer area leading into Tick Tock (your typical American brekky/burger venue) on one side and a bar on the other.  While check-out is conveniently late (midday), check-in is less conveniently so (at 3 pm - and when we arrived at 3:15 there was a queue 50 people long!). Still, the queue dissipated within half an hour and we were in our little room by 4. When I say little, that isn't just a familiar, affectionate term. The room was VERY small - even by New York;4
Ok, this location is right in the midst of Manhattan, hence the location name: Mid Town.  It's noisy, and even 22 floors up you can hear the subway.  However, the grand art deco entrance lobby is impressive and airy.  The staff were really helpful (but remember, they do earn money via tips, so it's in their interest to help you).  Our room was toasty and warm in the cold weather, and it turned out to be a suite with a bedroom with 2 double beds, a living room and 2 bathrooms.  Definite bonus.  If you walk outside and turn right, stand on the corner and look up to your left, you're right in the eyeline of the Empire State Building.;4
I have recently returned from a family trip and we stayed at the New Yorker....  Location- perfect, not too close to the noise of Times Square, but close to 5th avenue for shopping etc and just around the corner from the Empire State Building.  The rooms were large so space was not and issue and they were very clean (daily maid service) however they were just a little tired. (Chipped paint, tired bathroom etc). Kids loved the room, but having paid a lot for the trip, I was a teeny bit disappointed.   Tip: the tick tick diner is expensive (family of five breakfast, nearly $90) so take a walk around the corner to the Skylight Diner, amazing food and great atmosphere. (Proper American Diner).;3
We arrived at the Wyndham New Yorker which was only 1 min walk away from Penn Station. (We got the air train then the Long Island Railroad from JFK). We got booked in, which just to let people know they put a hold charge on a card, they did ask for credit card but they accepted our debit.   We went to our room which was the wrong room but they immediately changed it when we rang reception and said we had paid for a metro room view, then we went to our second room and oh mY!!!  The view was absolutely amazing. We emailed a few weeks before requesting a Empire State room ( which we knew we wouldn't definitely get but there was no harm in asking!) and we did get a view of the Empire State! AND Chrysler building AND Madison square garden!    The room was spotless, towels and;5
The Wyndham is only one short block from Penn Station and hence an easy walk with rolling luggage. Our room was reasonable size and adequately appointed-- no complaints. Security is good. The Tick Tock Diner opens into the hotel lobby( also opens to the outside). There is an OK restaurant in the hotel also. This is a good mid-priced hotel for a New York visit.;4
The staff were beyond compare. As an older woman traveling I felt safe and well taken care of. Both Leslie and Eva made my stay great. They assisted me in every way I needed from taking care of any thing I needed. The room was clean and quiet. The restaurant connected to the hotel was perfect the Chef came to my table and made our deserts right at our table and sent out several samples. As I had s friend from the area join me for dinner it was great and we felt very special. I would highly recommend the staff as they were professional, spoke to me every day I stayed there, made sure my room was okay and let me know if I had s problem they would make sure it was taken care of. I highly recommend this hotel because of their staff. Bobbi Gagne Executive Director;5
This huge hotel was very busy when I checked-in on December 31st in time for New Year's Eve 2016 Times Square ball drop on that same night. I paid a non-refundable standard queen room with guaranteed views of either Empire State Building, Manhattan skyline with Freedom Tower/One World Trade Center or Hudson River.  At the time I checked-in it was still early around noontime but front desk staff gave a room on the 26th floor and remind me that I can proceed around 3pm as this is the standard check-in time. Around 3pm I went to my room and found out that my room faced another huge building and has no view. I went down and told her the situation and annoyed me by asking what view I want as she is working with hotel for more than 20 years or so and she knows what she have given me.;3
Great check in staff, security at the elevators//must show room key..I used my Wyndham points for a free stay..anf for $20.00 I upgraded to a double Queen..2 Queen beds, @ closets and @ full baths..on the 24th floor. The lobby is very Hollywood Art Deco and that is carried into the guestrooms. The Hotel is only a short walk from Port Authority straight up 8th Ave...many shops and eateries very close. The Tick Tock Diner attached to the hotel has wonderful coffee and breakfasts.;5
Love this hotel..stayed there in march.. my 4 th time staying there & enjoyed every time...the tick rock diner has lovely food& the location can't be beaten..Am returning again this March with my daughter ..can't wait;4
"I was extremely disappointed to be charged $27 per day facilities fee.  Yes that is true it is in the ""fine print"" of the Priceline terms and conditions that there may be additional fees such as a resort fee or parking charges.  This hotel is not a resort and I was not planning to park.  The ""amenities"" provided are free local calls, use of the business center, and excercise room.   These are basic services that are included in most 3-star and all 4-star hotels.  I feel like I was deceived. On the other hand the service and location are still top notch.";3
"Nice location and close to shops, 5th ave and subway, also Time square in walking distance. Hotel is also on the ""Hop on, hop of route"" if you want to explore New York. Staff was friendly and helped with airport transfer after the company that I booked with dropped us.";5
"Stayed during March 2015 and the hotel was wonderful! Loved the location and how close it was to Penn Station.  Stayed in Marriott Marquis previously and yes their rooms are much larger and it was in Times Square but for us, we like the ""neighborhood"" feel and the 1930s feel of the New Yorker.  Our room was very very clean and everything as updated.  We had a view of the Hudson River without paying for a ""View"" room.  I was hesitant myself due to some prior bad reviews, but if you are wanting something close to Penn Station, Macys, Empire, and ALL sub trains, great service, clean rooms, definitely try the New Yorker!";5
Second time visiting this hotel and it did not let us down. Beautifully situated near Madison square and within a short walking distance of all the major attractions - Times Square , Empire State, Byrant Park and for shopping Maceys and 5th Ave. If travelling further afield Penn Station is right next to the hotel . The hotel staff are very helpful , rooms are comfortable, some with great views of the Empire State Building and Manhatten. One of our personal favourites is the Tick Tock diner , open 24/7 serving some of the best pancakes I've tasted in New York. Reasonable priced and a great location- well worth staying in one of New Yorks historic hotels;5
Great location, The hotel was Art deco design & stunning. My sister-in-law was celebrating her 50th so they gave us a fab room overlooking the Empire state & free calls for our whole stay. There is a diner / bar attached called Tick Tocks, great food & staff were very friendly.  Would stay here again. They spoilt us.;5
The hotel was in terms of Price one of the best options for this period of the year (between 25 and 31 of décembre) The room We had was ok not more and it was noisy since for ex you could year your neighbor taking a shower ! Aldo the Windows are not at all preventing from external noise or weather conditions I could feel the outside temperature from my Bed and also outside wind! It is hard to have a final conclusion but again for the Price it was the best option knowing that We only spent Time to sleep and the rest of the day was Fully occupied with business activity;3
I found this hotel very welcoming. The room was small but adequate. We had 2 bathrooms, one at either end of the room. Rooms are kept clean and tidy with towels changed daily if you have used them.  All staff were happy to offer information even if that meant telling you that something could be cheaper to buy elsewhere.  I like that sort of honesty. The restaurants attached to either side are of variety and both excellent. If you ever go to New York but don't stay at the New Yorker then visit the Tick Tock cafe as I can assure you that you will receive the best french toast with Nutella and banana ever!  My biggest regret is that I only had it once. This hotel is ideally placed for access to anywhere within New York with Maceys and the Empire State just a five mins walk. Times;4
3 generations of ladies in my family came recently. We absoloutly loved it. The room we stayed in was large - 2 double beds - lots of storage - 2 closets & lots of drawer space. Wasn't expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised! Bathroom was small but very clean.  Hairdryer in room & safe too. When you go to New York you are barely in your room as there is so much to do - but after long busy days it was a welcome relief to get into a very comfy bed. I would def stay here again! And I will!! Thank you to all staff who were all helpful & polite. We used both restaurants  - tick tock was a really lovely place to have breakfast & the staff there were all wonderful ( the chatting from the waiters was welcomed from us & only thing that we didn't like was one of the waiters kept;4
We stayed here for 10 nights in december 2015 me my partner and our 2 year old.. the outcome.. it was OK. The location was great but the room was very small. We travelled to NY last year around the same time but stayed further out and wanted something a little more central this year.. In future we would stay further away for a better hotel. Our room had 2 double beds, so we thought it would be pretty spacious.. also from the pictures we seen on the hotel website we were confident we would have a comfortable stay. Not at all. The room was tiny with just enough space to move around the beds. The bathroom decor was poor. There was paint pealing off the bath and all in all the whole room needed updating. The draught from the windows was really cold! And with a 2 year old this is;3
"i remember staying in New Yorker before it was taken over by Wyndham and ""renovated"" and the stay was much better. Nowadays, walls are paper thin, you hear everything in the hallway and room next door. Terrible experience, would not stay here again.";2
Given its handy proximity to the centre of New York I was going to err on the positive when it came to writing this review even though I have stayed in more impressive 2* hotel. So I had planned to emphasise that the fact that the public areas and  room were kept lovely and clean. Some of the staff were friendly and helpful. HOWEVER the additional unexpected charge of the equivalent to £20 PER DAY called a FACILITY FEE totally overshadowed the few positives. I had already pre paid in a package deal for my 5 night stay. I had no extras in the very small basic double room which had no mini bar or drink making facility but on check out got an equivalent to £100 bill. When I questioned this I was told in a very abrupt manner that this was a facility fee for use of the business;1
Well located close to subway, restaurants and shopping. Some rooms are very old and small, but if you talk to the reception, they may help to may your stay more pleasant. Only at check out I learned I could have a coffee machine in the room. International calls are included in the facility fees.;4
Perfect for the traveler that wants to get a feel for the classic Art Deco hotel that you've seen in all the old movies!  I believe part of the hotel has been updated, unfortunately, part of it has not and that's where our room was.  Windows were very drafty and privacy in each room is minimal.  Doors opening and closing in hallways sounded like someone was entering your room.  Deadbolt on door alleved that slight panic each time:)  We had an amazing view of Empire State Building and enjoyed the very NY style Tick Tock Diner for breakfast off the lobby.  Would stay there again but may ask for one of the newer rooms next time!;3
It so nice to be able to write a glowing review of a hotel!! Especially when redeeming points.  Unfortunately, with Wyndham, when you redeem points, it appears that you get the worst rooms the hotels have to offer and the customer is seriously lacking. My sister who frequents the Marriott chain, states that she is treated equally well when she redeems her points and her rooms are equally as good if not better, because they want to make a point of appreciating her loyalty. In my experience, redeeming points with Wyndham has been a BAD experience....EXCEPT for the WYNDHAM NEW YORKER.  #1 customer service!!  Average room but it had no issues and was tastefully done.  The pillows were glorious!  From the second that I walked in the hotel until the second I left, I was treated;5
From before we arrived to leaving the service was fantastic. Room really clean and tidy as was the full hotel.  I contacted the hotel before traveling as wanted to make sure the booking was all in place and from there the customer service I received could not have been any better. When we arrived it was really busy and had a short wait but the staff was very friendly and polite.  The hotel is in a great location for seeing all of new York. We walked everywhere and seen loads. If I was to go back I would book this hotel again.;5
Older hotel but in a great location! Across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Close to and within walking distance to Macy's, Empire State Building, Herald Square, Flat Iron Building and Times Square. Room was nice....pretty standard...2 double beds, small bathroom, closet. Good views in some rooms...others not so much. Security was great and felt that the hotel did a great job of making sure people that were in the hotel were actually guests of the hotel. Two restaurants attached to the hotel...ate at Tick Tock for Breakfast my last day...diner atmosphere, pretty good food. There's also a McDonald's and Starbucks across the street. The only reason I am not not giving an excellent rating is I reserved 2 rooms...checked in at 3pm (which is check-in time) and;4
The hotel lobby is nice, but the rooms, and especially the bathrooms, are badly in need of restoration. The tile in the bathroom in the room where I stayed was painted a sick green color, and the paint was chipping off. Both the room and bathroom were very worn out. The staff is friendly, and service is good. They just need to update the rooms!;2
Great stay only 4 blocks from Times Square and 2 blocks from Empire State Building .  Minutes to penn station.;5
Expensive hotel but great location. Right in the middle of everything and easy to find and get to. The rooms are small and basic however we had a great view of the empire state building. Nice and clean interior of the hotel with a handy shop in the hotel. Friendly and helpful staff;3
When I travel, I search out older hotels with lots of history and/or character.  The New Yorker fits the bill on both counts.  Not many hotels can claim the history and importance of the New Yorker.  Looking around one can feel the span of history and the hundreds of important celebrities and momentous events here.  The rooms were surprisingly spacious and well appointed and the staff was tremendous.  Very reasonable and close to everything in Mid-town.;5
"The New Yorker is a classic Art Deco hotel rich with history and charm. The luxury hotel snobs would find the hotel a bit tired; we didn't. We loved the patina and everything about it. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the location is perfect. It's steps from Penn Station and all the subways. It's not far from Times Square and practically next door to Macy's and the Garment District. I'd stay there again, in a heartbeat.";5
Traveled with daughter and grand daughters ( 12 & 10).  Room small double beds but ok for us. Very clean, beds very comfy. Need more mirrors.  Bathroom very very very small. No exhaust fan but we raised the window when necessary. It was a refurbished hotel. Service was excellent need more wash cloths (girls) and they responded instantly. we were on the 27th floor. Baggage hold and front desk very polite. We would stay again.  Convenient restaurant for breakfast.   Impressed with security.;4
Helpful staff from check in and quite convenient expedited check out. Also doorman was helpful when we're considering transportation options. Small room though at its price and bathroom had limited toiletries.  There was also limited power supply;3
The location of this hotel is very good. It is right across Madison Square Garden and Penn Station where you can take a couple of subways and trains. The busstop is about 10 minutes walking from the hotel.  From our room we saw the Empire State Building (5 minutes walking), Madisons Square Garden and the Chrystler Building. It is easy to walk to Times Square (10 minutes).  The room was clean. The bathroom could be a little more modern, but it was clean and that is important. The rooms are very noisy, so you can almost everything your neighbours do. Also, too bad there was no refrigerator in the room.  The staff was very helpfull and even gave us a discount on the fee you have to pay per night because we stayed there for 10 days. That was cool.;4
great location,  we travel by Amtrak , the hotel is 1 block from Penn Station.  We were provided a nice, clean room, front desk staff very helpful. Ticktock diner in hotel was very convenient and good for breakfast.  Also Hertz car rental directly behind hotel if you need a car.;5
"Perfect, central location with Penn Station, 34th street subway, Macy's and Madison square garden within stumbling distance. No ""own"" restaurant but two associated restaurants in the building. (Dont expect to find a European continental breakfast, though.) Pricey so there are surely more cost effective places to stay. One of the few hotels on Manhattan that allow up to six persons in a suite.";4
We stayed here just before christmas and had a great stay. The checkin staff were very friendly and after a long day travelling I asked about getting some bottles of water, the man at reception sent 4 bottles straight up to us free of charge. The room was clean and comfortable, the bathroom is tiny and it takes ages for the water to go from the sink though. WIFI was good in room.  The Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel is fantastic, we ate there every day.  All in all we had a great stay and Loved the hotel.;4
I stayed with my daughter in December. The receptionist and the guy in the lobby who books taxis to the airport were rude and unhelpful. Our room only had a view of the wall opposite but the beds were lovely. We got charged £20 a night for a facility fee for facilitates we didn't use (gym and office) which added an unplanned £100 to our five day stay. This is a rip off which had left me very angry as i had budgeted very carefully for this holiday.;3
Top service from beginning to end, myself and husband had stayed at the New Yorker two years previous and wanted to return with our daughters. the service we received was unbeatable, from check in to check out. John checked us in and did everything possible to ensure our stay was comfortable and memorable. The maids were cheerful, friendly and helpful, as were all staff from the information desk.  A special mention to John for the transportation team, who arranged our transfers to and from the airport, without his service we would have been cramped in a yellow taxi, instead we travelled in comfort.  Will be returning again in two years time. Thank you guys for making our stay that extra little bit special.;5
We stayed for 7 nights over Christmas and had a very pleasant stay. Reception were most helpful. We had no tea making facilities but a call to reception rectified that. Housekeeping was good and done on a daily basis. Lovely hotel with lots of history. A real 1920's feel about it. Ideally located. We had a fabulous view from our hotel room of the Empire State Building (Amazing). The Tick Tock diner within the hotel is open 24/7 and provides you with a huge menu, good food at reasonable New York prices. We would stay there again without a doubt.;4
If you want to be very close to all things central then this is a good place to stay. Great location, very close to Times Square, The Empire State Building and the shops. Also very close to the Subway to get around further a field. This is however the only plus! You need to be out most the time as the hotel is very dated and the rooms need a big face lift! Wall paper coming away from the walls and the bathroom is just big enough to swing a cat! No drink facilities in the room which even the basic hotels have in these days.  Overall its an average hotel with a great location.;3
My wife and I stayed here for a Christmas in New York getaway weekend.  We enjoyed the location and the history of the hotel was pretty cool.  Outside of that, the lobby had a smell when we checked in due to heavy rain, but it went away as the weekend went on.  The room was small which I guess can be expected.  We were right at the end of a hallway by the elevators but surprisingly it wasn't that loud.  There were other signs of the building be old but overall you could tell they were doing the best with what an old building will give you.  Our stay was pleasant and relatively comfortable.  However, when we come back we'll probably look to stay somewhere else.  We'd stay here again if there weren't any comparable options.;4
I stayed for 2 nights in this hotel, the location is great near to everywhere ,the staff was very friendly and the room had a great view but a little small for 3 people.;4
We were in the 9 th floor with a view of the Empire state building. The room was moderate in size by NYC hotel standards. The bathroom was big in comparison to other nyc hotels. Easy access to taxis and local food. There was some renovation going on, when we stayed, but the hotel was fully booked. We paid extra for wi fi.;5
We travel by AMTRAK at least twice a year and use Penn. Sta. This hotel is very convenient to the station even for one with heart failure.  The ambience of this storied hotel is like a step back to the time when real money was spent on hotels.  Art deco styling everywhere throughout the building.  The rooms are surprisingly large for this location in Manhattan.  The original rooms, those yet to be renovated, display the ingenuity of the state of the art plumbing and craftsmanship that was first class.  Famous bands of the big band era and many celebrities made this their hotel of choice.  Nikola Tesla even lived here (33rd floor) for ten years!  Everything works superbly!  All rooms are equipped with up to date HVAC, TV and beds. The remodeled rooms combine the best of the art;5
The location of the hotel is great - opposite MSG/Penn St station and just a few minutes from Times Square and the Empire State. It is a perfect base to explore New York from.  Basic rooms are small for a family and you may or may not be lucky with the view. Our first room had no view but the second room, on a corner, had great views. The hotel is a bit worn but the rooms are clean and the showers were excellent.  There are plenty of places to eat nearby. We used the Skyline Diner, just 5 minutes away, 3 times whilst we were there. Probably only real criticism is the check-in process - the queues were long and disorganised. I think it was as stressful for the staff as it was for the guests. Oh, and beware, you will be stung for $20+ per night for Wi-Fi and phone calls even if;3
We chose this hotel for its proximity to Madisson Square Gardens and the Billy Joel concert. From that perspective it fit the bill perfectly. However, the rooms themselves were very cramped and basic and it looked like the whole place was in need of a good clean. As is typical in the city, things like Wifi and even the business centre came at a sizeable extra cost making the headline rate much less than the final bill!;3
Had an excellent 4 day stay at the New Yorker very clean with nice bar, restaurants and fitness room with friendly and helpful staff. Hotel is with in walking distance to Madison square gardens, Empire State and time square etc with Subway and buses just on the corner so access to all areas of New York is very easy. Would definitely stay again.;5
We stayed for 5 nights at Wyndham New Yorker during Christmas 2015.  Centrally located to shopping, polite staff, good restaurant, large lobby.  Very good hotel for family.  However, we found the rooms to be small.  Could have helped if we had coffee making facility at the hotel.;4
"If you want to be very close to things in NYC, this is a very good choice of place to stay. What we liked:  location; friendliness of the staff; quietness inside the hotel (our hotel room faced the river); nice sheets and comfortable bed; great shower with nice hot water; free, non-glitchy internet; proximity to good restaurants and other stores (Macy's is a block away; CVS is on the corner); Penn Station is across the street (we took the train to NYC). There is a diner attached to the hotel that offers all kinds of good breakfasts. You are minutes from the high line. Many things to appreciate here! What could have been better:  room was a little tight but ok; paint was peeling in bathroom. That said, these were not big enough issues to really fret about. Enjoy yourself!";3
Excellent location! I could see MSG from my window (which opened slightly for some fresh air) The front desk and the tour people were all extremely helpful. The hotel is close to a booze store if you need some alcohol for your trip. There is lots of restaurants and street food available in close proximity.;4
"Ok. Well if you have read any of my reviews you will know that they are spot on. So lets take a quick look at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel. This current hotel was built in 1930; and basically refurbed a bit in 1994. The Wyndham chained has owned since about 2014. With that said keep in mind the building is 85 years old. This hotel is a mid price range hotel on the backside of MSG (the garden). I stayed in room #2926 which has a great city view and basically a straight shot of THE EMPIRE STATE BLDG. The bathrooms are nice-ISH. For a 85 yr old building that only charges people/patrons a price point of mid range it is what you pay for. Water pressure is good in shower and occassionally you will get hit with ice cold water and then it will go back to hot. So piece of advice is dont";3
"This hotel really is awful from beginning to end about the only positive thing I can say about it is that the location is good! We've stayed in Manhattan many times and are aware that hotel rooms tend to be small but this was literally a postage stamp size! The receptionist Driss was friendly and tried to appoint us with his best available ""modern"" room on the 29th floor but when we got up there not only was it tiny and smaller than a double bed but there was fake tan stains and hairs on the sheets, when I went down to complain the manager asked could he send someone up to change the sheets and didn't seem shocked at all! I refused and asked for a new room, we were given one on the 34th floor, the corridors were filthy with dirty tissues and an awful smell the room was tiny";1
Booked through booking.com  We expected that we would probably pay alot seeing as we were staying over new years. When we arrived we were told that there was a $27 per day facility fee on top of what we had already paid which covered access to the gym (which we didn't use) and phone calls (what we didn't make). When we recieved the bill upon checking out it appears that they also added tax to that $27! So it was closer to $30 per night. For a 7 night stay that is crazy and increased the stay by alot of money. It never stated anywhere that there would be extra charges especially for things we didn't use! And they take $315 American off your credit card as security without telling you (not sure if that is just an American thing but I thought it was usually around $50 for security);3
Having been updated recently to its original 1920s decor this hotel looks fantastic although the bedrooms are a little dated. The staff were really friendly and the Tick Tock diner attached was perfect for breakfast and brunch. The location next to Madison square garden was ideal for getting to see all the sights uptown and downtown and so close to Times Square. All in all a fantastic place to stay.;4
My daughter and I stayed for 3 nights in a metro view room on the 32nd floor. We had a great view of the Empire State Building. The room was clean and well furnished. The bathroom was exceptionally clean and functional, despite the 1920's plumbing. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. One gentleman even ran after us as my daughter left her phone in the room. The Tick Tock diner is good, but a little pricey for what you get. McDonalds and Starbucks are right across the street. The location is great and the hotel offered good value. The business centre and wifi were particularly good. We didn't use the fitness centre, but it looked well equipped. Loved the museum area. I would definitely use this hotel again.;5
We found this hotel off of a deal on Expedia and I have to say I was a little wary. Also a little annoyed at the $20/day facility fee when it's only a gym and my family was not going to use it. Just include it in the price, New Yorker, and call it a day! The line to check in was long and slow but I've just summarized my only two negatives. It is nicely renovated, and while the room was small, my stepkids (3) got a double room with two bathrooms--how does that happen? Our view on the 25th floor was of 34th street and not so interesting but still beautiful. The twists and turns getting to your rooom remind me of the Waldorf...love me an old hotel. Very friendly reception, clean, renovated room -- very small for getting around with four of us, but who spends time in the room in NYC;5
With this extremely old hotel i had to face issues like horrible garbage smell , extremely small rooms and even worse, careless staff members. I addressed the smell issues twice and they didn't take care of it. Need serious upgrades. Not coming back.;1
Pros: The location is great, walk distance to Empire State Building, downstairs has CVS for travel essentials, subway station connects you everywhere, beautiful night lighting from Madison Square Garden.   - The staffs are professional and helpful.  - There are sofa and desk setup in lobby if you need to charge your electronics and get work done.  - As it is an old-fashioned hotel (no fancy card reader in the historic elevators), room key is checked manually before getting to elevator.  - There is mailbox and key-drop box in the lobby if you are in hurry. - We did not check out the fitness facility (i.e. enough walk in central park :), but it is convenient for anyone who has regular exercise routine. - Room is clean and comfy though not spacious.  Cons: - Keep in mind it is;4
Our first visit to New York but since I had spent time to learn about the city I chose this hotel for price and location. My wife and I were not disappointed with the room (37th floor with a view looking south). Worth the extra I think. Room was ok but a bit cramped...this being NY there was no kettle in the room. But the diner on the ground floor was very good value and was open 24 hours. I got coffees every morning from Starbucks over the road to take back to the room first.  The location is VERY handy for tourists being close to two subway lines serving 34th Street. Penn station on the opposite corner. Buying a multi day or multi journey subway ticket is cheap and simple. Location was excellent for walking to attractions and shops...On 34 St you get Macy's and the Empire;4
I greatly enjoyed my stay at the New Yorker Hotel that is centrally located near Times Square and all of the tourist locations.  There is plenty to see and do within blocks of the hotel.  The rooms were clean and relatively inexpensive for New York.  While the New Yorker is not a 5 star hotel, it provides great value for the money.;5
My wife an I recently visited NYC for a pre-holiday get-away!  The Wyndham New Yorker is strategically located near Times Square and the Theater District.  The entire staff of the Wyndham New Yorker cheerfully worked to make sure our stay was safe and enjoyable!  This a a GREAT place to stay near many of the Big Apple's attractions!;5
Spent a couple nights in town to see a show. Used rewards points, so the stay was basically free. Happy with the location, facilities, and service. An added bonus was looking out the window straight down 34th St at the Empire State Building. Would stay again.;4
Just returned from our first trip to New York and stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker , Found the location of the hotel great we were to walk to a lot of the sites ,Central Park ,rocker feller centre ,grand central station, maceys etc  .The hotel I found really good check in no problem had two rooms one being a double room two double beds the room was great really good size the other a metro with queen size bed was small but we found it fine. The bed  was really comfortable clean sheets and lovely fluffy towels bathroom little dated but clean . Next to the hotel is the tick tock diner we ate breakfast in there a few times really enjoyed trying different omelettes  and pancakes each day. I would defiantly return to this hotel it built in the 1930s had a feel of old New York and Art;4
The room was otherwise fine but somewhere noisy--thin walls I guess.  In particularly the siund of running water in the morning.;4
Well, not quite sure where to start. I took my wife, 10 year old child and mother in law, paid for a 2 room suite, when I arrived I was told there had been a leak and that I would not be able to stay in my room and I would have to stay in a double room for the first night.. This would of been fine if I was just with my wife, but for our 10 year old child and mother in law of 61 to sleep on a single chair that was apparently a double pull out bed was never going to work. However, after complaining they eventually gave us a room with 2 double beds, with an air condition that sounded like a Boeing 747 engine. So hot and stuffy we remained for the rest of the night. The next morning I asked if I could have the room we booked for. I was then told my bank card was declined and I never;1
I would not stay if I was you. when I got to the room there was a used condom on the floor. when I called to the front desk the manager had an attitude at first. he assured me that he would refund one night for me. that never happened when I called back he said he was going to look into it and call me back, well its been over a week and still no call. the rooms are very small and if you try and have any food delivered to the room you cant. the security at the hotel said u have come down and get it. pick a different hotel and you'll have a better trip.;1
Had a great week staying at this hotel. Check in was quick & efficient & got a complimentary breakfast for our party as it was my birthday & I declined a bottle of champagne as I don't really drink. Had a fantastic view of Empire State Building from our room! The room was spacious with 2 double beds & plenty of space to put our clothes. Staff were friendly & room was cleaned daily.  Great location with major attractions within walking distance of about 10-15 minutes. For security you had to show staff your key card to enter lift area. Would definitely return to this hotel in the future.;5
It was a very enjoyable stay. Good service, and the lobby was beautiful compared to what we've seen. The room was clean, and had a great view to the city. The shower water was clean and the shower faucets worked well. The bathroom was clean, and the room was welcoming. The service was nice, and almost every employee smiled. The room service was fast and easy, they sent someone experienced quick. At night, it wasn't too noisy, nor too quiet, which I enjoyed. Although, the standard room was quite small for a family of four, it was all wonderful.  In conclusion, I loved my stay, and recommend it for anyone who wants a excellent location and an enjoyable New York experience.;5
All staff personnel demostrated super service  in a highly professional manner. I will s=certainly stay here again and addition recommend this hotel to all.;5
I stayed there for Christmas, when there are a lot of tourists from other countries also in the hotel. People there are very friendly and patient to non-English speakers.  My room is kind of small but is clean and tidy. It has two windows and the view is great from 20th floor.  Location is great great, very convenient to the train stations, port authority bus station, penn station and time square.  One thing I don't like is, because the building is very old, there is a little bit smell in the corridor. Except that, everything else is good.;4
We stayed at the New Yorker hotel for 8 nights in December. We booked an executive room that had recently been renovated. It didn't disappoint! There was no view from our room (748) however the room itself is very spacious and clean. There's a coffee machine (they supply the water and coffee capsules!), a safe, tv and a radio which you can plug your phone into. The bathroom was also clean. The hotel is in a good location between 34th Street and 8th Ave. This was my 4th stay in this hotel and I'll definitely be back!;5
"I frequently stay in Wyndham properties, and this was definitely not their worst, but certainly not among the best.  Overall, for a quick 1-2 night weekend trip, this was great.  Very central location.  Easy walking to Penn Station and other attractions.  Made for a good home base as we bounced around the city and needed to grab extra layers as the night went on.  Otherwise, not the greatest  experience.  The lobby was very crowded a time of check in, and the clerk who helped us in the specially designated ""Wyndham Rewards Gold Member"" line was pretty rude and short.  She gave us quite the attitude, even after I told her i was a Gold member and using my points for this stay, and that I was not in a rush and for her to take her time.  She then tried to make up for her";3
For December in NYC price was okay. An older hotel. Said they had renovated recently, but couldn't tell in our room. NY hotels have small rooms and they would certainly help guests by putting in some hooks in bathroom to hang clothes/towels.  This was walking distance to Empire St Bldg, Macy's, and Theater district (in good weather).  Friendly staff and also a good restaurant connected to hotel with very good breakfasts.;3
I visited for 2 nights on business, and being my first time in New York was immediately shocked by the tiny size of the room!! It had all the amenities I needed so I was not lacking anything. However, it is the most aged and tired looking hotel I have ever stayed at. I'm not one for quirky charm of the past and if my budget had afforded it - would have stayed somewhere newer and more modern. Regardless, it is a great location and thankfully I only had to sleep there (although it is super loud on the streets all night long even though I was 20 floors up - and the bed was slanted and not comfortable at all lol) my back is against the door in the pic I have included. Looks nice - but it's deceiving! The great part was that I had a short walk to Times Square for some sight seeing;2
"Very good location for what we wanted to do. Small room, as expected in NYC. Staff was friendly enough, but was a real test of patience for a simple item we asked for, for our room. (1 additional chair) Not a recliner, a desk chair. 3 calls to front desk. Also, we were NOT told of a (SURPRISE !!) $25.00 Facilities Fee upon check in. EXTREMELY upsetting and the desk clerk only offered, ""I'm sorry. You should have been told.""...........";3
This was my first trip to NYC. I was referred to this hotel by a friend. The staff was very helpful. Location was great, right next to MSG and Penn Station. It's an older hotel that has been remodeled nicely. Good beds. Bathroom was a little small but was nice. View of the city was awesome. I would stay here again because of the proximity. Also, the Tick Toc cafe on site was excellent for breakfast.;4
"Like others have said, location is good and the price is definitely on the cheaper side. However, there are hidden fees for the ""free"" wifi of which you pay PER NIGHT. The shower and bathroom is incredibly outdated and the rooms are depressingly small. You'll have a much better deal elsewhere getting a nicer hotel for the same price after you count in the hidden fees.";3
"My family visited New York just before Christmas. This was our third stay at the New Yorker.  We stay there because of its blend of location, room rates, room size, decor, and views.  We like the older style rooms which do have vintage style bathrooms; anyone looking for a more modern bathroom will be disappointed. We've had different room shapes and layouts each time we've stayed (we always request a view room). Some of the rooms are definitely smaller than others, but out of 4 rooms 3 of them have had 2 chairs in a small sitting area.  There is no refrigerator, the water temperature does vary at times, the bathrooms don't have much storage, and there is definitely a need for electrical outlets near the beds - but these are small things for us. You can't beat the location if";4
Really convenient location with subway station nearby Small size rooms but clean, good price for New York standards. I will recommend to go for breakfast on the dinners around the area instead of the hotel´s restaurant- as price will be much better.  Overall, I would recommend for a stay in NYC, great and convenient location to move around.;4
We stayed at the New Yorker the first weekend in December and really enjoyed it. It was very convenient. The subway was right there and it was a easy walk to Macy's. The hotel staff was amazing not only did they check key cards, which made me feel much safer, but they were a lifesaver when our car service left us stranded.;4
We arrived at about 2:00pm for a 3 night stay in NYC on 7 December 2015. On arrival, there were only two couples in front of us checking in and we were called over to a desk to the right of the main check-in desk. We were checked in by a lovely lady and I was telling her how excited we were to be in NY on our first trip and that it was my birthday the following day and also that we were celebrating our 25th anniversary. We had booked a standard room with queen size bed, but the check-in lady said she would see what she could do and in fact upgraded us to a corner room on the 37th floor with fabulous duel aspect views, one of the Hudson River. I was also offered a free bottle of Champagne which I accepted graciously. (In fact I was sent Prosecco, but I still thought the gesture;5
We stayed here last year just before Christmas and did the same this year.  The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. The hotel is clean and well maintained, but gives you that New York charm.  We had a room with a view of the Garden and Empire State Building.  Great location and well worth a stay.;4
Since the reopening 21 years ago we are staying in The NewYorker. The hotel is imporving all the time. But one continue factor is the friendly and helpful staff. The same people who are working there year after year!;5
"WE stayed here for the last few days of our visit to NYC in October 2015.  It was very centrally located, and we were delighted that we could just walk out of the hotel and be in the middle of all the shops we wanted to visit.  The hotel was packed when we arrived to check in, and we had to queue for a little while (which was a pain), but we eventually got to our room (on the thirty-something floor) - had to use a particular lift.  Rooms were very clean, not impressed that there was no shower gel bottles provided.   When I called housekeeping about this, they brought up more soap bars - which was just what I did not want!  They said they didn't have any s hower gel in stock at that particular time.  We were even less impressed with their ""cover charge"" policy - this was";3
Rooms are small with older facilities and minimal lighting. Beds are good and firm though which is welcome after the long days of walking. The hotel is directly above ACE subway lines and allows easy access up/downtown. There are also convenient eateries downstairs with a casual diner option and a slightly more upscale Italian-style restaurant.;4
"We were looking for a hotel just for night in Manhattan, New Yorker is right next to Madison Square Garden. Old but clean, the staff was polite, the room was small but for ""price-quality"" it's a good option for NYC. I used gym in the morning which had decent equipment. Location is great, walking distance to pretty much anything in Manhattan. I would definitely consider this hotel during my next visit in NYC.";4
Hotel is lovely but beware of those facility fees you are charged per day. Apparently it's for the use of telephone and wi-fi.   On check in day the guy at the desk said all that is free, so what's the charge for?  Definitely will be writing a personal email to the manager.   We we also located in a corner room, where you can hear the creaky taps and when someone is taking a shower. Disturbs sleep. We asked several times for someone to help us with the safe as we couldn't activate a code. No one helped.   Service is poor. Disappointed.;3
Having, in the past, paid much (much, much) more for much (much, much) less 'room' in NYC, I was ecstatic when I saw my bill from the New Yorker.  Seriously, people who are complaining about tiny rooms and price do not understand how bad it can get in the city.  We visited about a week prior to Christmas, which is probably high-mid season in terms of pricing, but paid far less than we've paid in other 'trendier' areas of town to stay in absolute dumps during low season.    Our activities were all in midtown for this trip, so the New Yorker was super convenient.  But really as easy as it is to Uber to wherever you want to go, I'd stay here even if it wasn't necessarily close to my activities.  Rooms were clean, elevators plentiful and fast, front desk/concierge/valet/housekeeping;4
Unfortuanetely, my friends and I stayed at this disgusting hotel for my birthday. It seemed great at first, until the morning we were checkin-out. My two friends were both sick (it's December...) and they both had a bad cough. That morning, a man from the front desk knocked on our door and said someone had complained we were smoking....None of us smoke and the room didn't even smell. My friend told him we weren't smoking and he just left. How rude! We were quickly getting ready and suddenly we saw a cockroach crawl across the room. EW!!!! We all screamed so loud. My one friend jumped on the bed, the other jumped in the bathtub, and I jumped on the chair. 3 girls 1 cockroach, real classy. I called housekeeping after waiting for front desk to pick up for sooooo long (fantastic;1
Great renovation of the historic lobby. Outstanding location next to Penn Station. Good quality bedding and towels. Small room (typical for New York) but incredibly dark with one window and view of HVAC stack. Second room in a row with this same depressing feature.;3
Been here two nights so far for our first Christmas overseas and we are having a ball. In the executive room which is very large especially for New York standards, plenty of room to walk around. Service is fantastic and the rooms are nice and modern. Great spot close to the trains and so to Times Square and everything else. Would highly recommend this spot!;5
We stayed at the New Yorker and it was so convenient to the things the they wanted to do. We went to Times Square several times and took the subway to Central park. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and easy to work with. We used the valet parking. Easy in and for us easy out. The rooms were small but nice, the girls had a few of the empire state building. It was not noisy. The beds were comfortable and i got a good nights rest in spite of being used to a water bed at home.;5
We stayed here on our first family trip to New York, and it wasn't too bad at all! When we arrived there was a bit of mayhem with the suitcases, it seemed they were a little short staffed for the amount of people checking in but all the staff were friendly so this didn't matter a jot! The rooms were clean, comfortable (albeit a little dated) and we had a cracking view in our room too. Because its such a big hotel prepare to wait for the lifts a long time in busy periods! We were only here to sleep really as you don't waste time in a hotel room when in New York but it was perfect for what we needed and would recommend! Its not far from the Empire State and has a good restaurant too!;4
This was my best vacation ever! From the price to the staff to the quality of the room it couldn't have been any better!;5
What a great experience!  The hotel is minutes from Madison Square Garden.  Quick check in.  Room was spacious.  Water pressure in shower was great!  Nice area and great bars and restaurants within blocks.  Definitely will come again!;5
We stayed @ the NYer a few years back & the room had a great view but was very run down (especially the bathroom). When we noticed that Wyndham now runs it & we saw how beautiful the lobby was renovated, we couldn't wait to see our room - nice headboard, sheets & curtains - bed very hard, toilet too low, bathtub/shower old, moldy & a little scary, carpet old, musty smell in the hallway. Great location & friendly, capable staff.;2
Booked two nights at this hotel on Priceline.  I expected the room to be small but it was much smaller than I expected.  The bathroom was even smaller and outdated.  The shower went from hot to warm to cold to scolding and back every few seconds which wasn't really an enjoyable experience.  The bed was extremely uncomfortable.  The one great thing about this hotel was the location.  Absolutely in the centre of everything.  Quick 5-10 min walk almost anywhere and literally right next to the subway.  They also charge a rather large daily fee for Internet, business centre and gym.;3
Me my fiancée and my parents  visited new york. We stayed in the new yorker after checking in  we went our rooms which where on the small side but got no complaints about that as it done what we needed it for sleeping the room was very clean and tidy. Staff at the hotel where helpful at the information desk we enjoyed our stay at the new yorker and if we visited new york again I would be happy to stay here again as it is very central and easy to get place from the hotel.;4
Came for a weeks visit with my sister in May 15. Hotel was lovely! Rooms a little small, and the bathroom was a bit dated but over all it was well kept! If your visiting New York then who cares what the hotel is like, go and visit the sites, as there is so much too do.;4
Just returned from a 4 night stay at the New Yorker & would highly recommend it! The room was quite big for New York standards & was one of the cleanest ive ever stayed in. The staff were all very friendly & helpful, checking in & out was very quick & easy even with the busy time of year. We used New Yorker rides for our transportation to & from JFK airport this was arranged quickly & efficiently with Louis at the desk. Our driver was Josh, he was extremely helpful & couldnt have been more friendly. Rates were reasonable only slightly more then we would have paid for a yellow cab.  Well worth a visit... already planning our next trip!;4
We were very pleased with the staff at this hotel, but for the three nights we were there, we could never get the thermostat to work correctly.  It was always too cold, like the heater didn't work at night.  Woke up freezing every morning.   When we first entered the room, one of the light bulbs was burnt out, and staff replaced it shortly after we reported it.  It is a typically small NYC hotel room with charming décor.  Comfortable beds.  You can see how historic the building is by the marble trim, old doors, showers, etc.;3
In all a good trip. The hotel was pretty much as the reviews. Good, very clean, but small rooms. The staff were attentive but incredibly busy.  We really tried to explore the City, all the typical sights and eating experiences we could. Empire State, Statue of Liberty, Katz (Harry met Sally fame) Radio City theatre for their Christmas show (Brilliant) but paid over the top for tickets. Ground zero! Not sure what to make of that experience. Bus tour, and nearly a whole day spent in Macy's , even had a picture taken with the Real Father Christmas. Andreas Bochelli even sang for us (and thousands of others I admit !!) at the turning on of the Christmas tree lights. Time Square was ..... Time Square, BUSY. The outstanding experience was a Basketball game with the NewYork Nicks at;4
The staff is very friendly. The style is Art deco and looks great. However, the bathrooms are still from the 1930's..... Also requesting for a room number on reservation in June doesn't give you the room number in December. Even after sending a (not answered by the hotel) reply a week before arrival. Value for money? NO.;3
Clean well kept rooms, but the rest of the hotel is tired looking. The actual room size is quite small with little room for your luggage, so you're always tripping over it all. The adjoining diner/restaurant is poor also. Having said all that, it didn't cost much and I suppose you pay for what you get, so I can't complain too much. It served our purposes being 2 mins walk from Mad Sq Garden, but we wouldn't stay there again.;3
On check-in found the reception staff to be a bit cold and impersonal.  They were having conversations amongst themselves instead of talking to the guests. Room was a decent size with comfy beds but bathroom was tiny and tired looking, really needed renovated. Bath/shower not great. Beds were clean with sheets renewed every day, but overall room could have been cleaned more thoroughly (very dusty light shade!). Housekeeping staff very friendly. Concierge staff also very friendly but they charge $2 per item of luggage they store. Very disappointing after also being hit with a bill of $23.95 per night for resort fees! The saving grace for this hotel is the location - very close to Macy's, Madison Square Garden and Times Square.;3
I have stayed here for business, this was the first family trip.  Hotel staff are very accommodating and helpful, make guests feel appreciated.  Concierge Suzie is fantastic.  Front staff Carmen and Jose are very easy to work with.  Hotel restaurant Trattoria Bianca food is excellent.  We had great fish and steaks, appetizers are fresh made and with international basis, olive plates, wonderful cheeses and more.  Check out the online menu.  Call the Hotel for special rates if you are there multiple nights.  Family leaving, I am staying, back in business mode.;4
A recent stay at the New Yorker was a huge disappointment.  No any think like the pictures on their website.  I expected the room to be small as many hotel rooms in NYC are on the small side.  This room looks like the last time it was renovated was just after WW II. The room was out dated and not even a comfortable chair to sit and read not that there was room for one.  It is a convenient location within walking distance of much of the city but not a very comfy or welcoming room to stay in.  Also for a hotel this size there were very few seats in the lobby.  More often then not all the couches and seats were full.  Sixty dollars at night to park.  WOW.;2
We booked this hotel as a base for our holiday in New York. Upon arriving, we were checked in and asked to sign for hidden charges that we had not been told about - this included a $25 a DAY charge to use the services in the hotel. When questioned about this a rude receptionist told us that it would allow us to use the hotel's FREE internet, as well as the fitness studio (which we had no interest in using), the business suite (we were there for a holiday) and a poorly put together exhibition. After much debate, this charge was removed from the bill.  Upon entering the room, we found it to be average in terms of furnishing however, there was no kettle, mini bar or additional facilities in the room. The sheet on one of the beds was also torn and when we moved a seat forward it was;1
Upon arrival we happened to be booked into a lower level room,(not a great view) but Jessica at the guest service desk was able to get us up to the 36th floor.  We now had a phenomenal view of the Empire State Building as well as the Chrysler building.  The room was on the smaller side but it was immaculate and suited our needs.  We had not realized what an amazing location this hotel is located, just steps from Madison Square Garden and Macy's.  This hotel also has valet service we found out that is rare in NYC.  This eliminated relying on mass transit schedules or confusion.  This is now a Wyndham affiliated hotel and worked well the reward systems they offer.  My 10 year old daughter loved seeing the Rocketts and all of the holiday Magic the city has to offer.;4
The Wyndham New Yorker was just across the road from Penn Station, so perfect for a short stay in New York when we travelled up by train from elsewhere in USA for a couple of days. The subway at Penn Station also proved really convenient and an excellent way to travel round New York. We were on the twenty-fifth floor with an excellent view. The room was a decent size and we slept really well on a firm, comfortable bed. The street noise was not a problem at all. The room was very clean, the staff were very helpful. The cost for a double room on Expedia was less than £100 a night, excellent for a city centre hotel in New York. The additional charge of 20% to the bill the next morning was a surprise because we did not use the gym or the printing facilities in their computer suite,;4
We always stay here due to its proximity to the Amtrak station which is a very short walk. For our purposes it is also very close to anything you might want to see in midtown Manhattan. This hotel is always clean with courteous helpful staff. A beautiful restaurant open 24hrs is in one corner with lots of windows to see the city activity. If you watch the room sale offers you can visit for a reasonable price in a very pricey city.;5
My family recently stayed her during the busy holiday season. This hotel has an older feel to it, you can tell it is a classic building but this should not be confused with being run down.  We drove into the city this time so we parked our car in front of the hotel to unload. The doorman will give you a check for your car and park it in a garage. Be sure to take everything you want at that time, there are no in and out priledges. Check in was easy. Once you have your keys, you do need to show them to get past an employee stationed by the elevators. There is also a concierge in the lobby as well as bellstaff.  Although some people say the rooms are small, our party of 3 stayed in room 2560 and it was not small for a NYC hotel room. It had a walk in closet with a safe, a smaller;4
We stay at the Wyndham New Yorker whenever we stay in NYC. It is a great Hotel in a great location. Rooms are small as are most in NYC but we spend very little time in the room anyway.;5
I stayed at the New Yorker while visiting for work. When I was younger, I used to book rooms for this hotel and I'd always wanted to stay there. As luck would have it, the hotel was only two blocks away from where I was taking my course.   I stayed for 4 nights and had breakfast each morning in the Tick Tock Diner.   My overall impressions:  Pros:  - Location - right in midtown. I walked everywhere.  - Extremely friendly staff.  - WiFi was reliable and fast, very important, as a business traveler.  - Tick Tock Diner was great for breakfast. A bit pricey, but excellent food.   Cons - My room didn't have much of a view, unfortunately.  - Service at the front desk was a little slow. No fault of the workers, just not enough of them while I was visiting.  - Noisy! This really didn't;3
As New York hotels go, this is not a bad one. What you see is what you get: slightly shabby but not too bad. Value for money? Where do you get that on Manhattan anyway. We were put off by the facilities charge that they add for Internet, the business center and what they call free international calls. Well, nothing is free, as you have to pay the charge whether you use the Internet or not. A bit sneaky. Rooms were ok, we were given one with a view when asked for it. The first was a joke, but the last room had good views.;3
Loved the art deco style of the hotel. The exterior was being upgraded when we were there but it didn't bother us at all.   It was in a great location. Right next to 34th St (lots of good shopping!), very close to Madison Square Garden & Penn Station. We walked everywhere as it was so central to a lot of things.  The room was quite small but that's New York for you! The only annoying this was that the room came with free Wi-Fi however we had to call tech support every single time we wanted to use it as it never worked. I think we made at least 10 calls in the week we were there. Each time it was fixed, it worked for about 20 minutes and then stopped again. Very frustrating as we used our iPad to connect with people at home as well as find things to do in NYC. We did get our;4
I had a bad experience with the hotel rate at The New Yorker Hotel in New York City, a Wyndham Hotel...  I booked this through Expedia.  Two weeks before the trip, I called the hotel to confirm our rooms and the rate.  We had two rooms.  The hotel told me it was $488.00.  I asked if that was for both rooms?  $244.00 per room.  The hotel said yes.  Then we got the bill.....$488.00 per room.   I called Wyndham Hotel Group in Parsippany, NJ and thought I could maybe get a small refund ( not unreasonable)on both rooms to ease the pain but they reused.  I thought this was unfair.;1
Older hotel in a great location, rooms are clean, housekeeping do a great job in cleaning and tidying.  Most staff are pleasant.    We had 2 bathrooms, both toilets blocked and overflowed.  The first time this happened it took 2 phone calls and a visit to front desk for maintenance to come and fix the problem.    Worst part of our stay was visiting the concierge desk at reception where you can purchase show tickets.  There was a lady with short hair at the desk who had absolutely no interest in helping.  We wanted to purchase Aladdin tickets that weren't too expensive as we are a family of 5.  All she could manage was to tell us how expensive they would be and probably would cost us $240 per seat. She then proceeded to tell us the only cheap tickets left would be for the;3
A little bit disappointed with this hotel, not very clean and uncomfortably small bathrooms.  The rooms were big and quite ok. TIC TOC diner was good for breakfast. The location was also very good. What made us not want to stay here again is the resort fee that is charged for usage of fitness and business center.;3
We paid £675 for 4 nights here!! All the staff in this hotel are pretty much New York rude!! No one smiles, no ones friendly and no one really wants to help you. Probably the worse hotel customer service we have ever had! Our first room on 29th floor (corridor was dirty and needed a huge make over) I think it was, was totally impractical, it was so small you had no where to put luggage & we had two suit cases! You have you place them buy the TV or somewhere & constantly walk round them! It had a horrible colour scheme so dark it was an 80 year old room!!! It kinda had half a view nothing wow. I complained and thank god the moved us to the newly refurbished 7th floor the room was 100% better white clean walls and great shower. Room for the bags inside the wardrobe but it was tiny;1
While this place has art deco charm when you first enter the lobby, entering the room loses that charm right away.  Small even for NYC, it doesn't seem like this place has been updated in decades.;2
"Spent a Sunday night on Dec13, 2015. Rates were less than half the price of Saturday a day earlier! So, if at all possible, stay Sunday nights. Staff was great - every single person!  Room was a ""Metro View"" double, that afforded us an incredible view of the Empire State Bldng, and the Chrysler & Met Life Bldngs as well. The room was small, but neat and had a safe in the closet. No refrigerator though. The white bath towels were clean, but shed like crazy when they were used to dry off! Had to ""dust"" each other off afterwards to remove all the white lint! I had a ""confirmation"" for Metro View, which, as the name implies, gives you a view of the NYC Skyling in Empire State direction, not Hudson River. Upon arrival I was told that was not available, only Hudson view. I contested";4
Hotel is convenient to Penn Station - Everyone is so helpful,friendly and professional.  One after the other greets you - laughs with you - and helps you if you need it.  I do a great amount of traveling and this hotel has my 5 star rating for sure.;5
We rented this through a travel site, can’t remember which one. Read the fine print, there was an extra charge,, which took some time to get my money returned but after some frustration it was refunded to my credit card. It is certainly a New York hotel, small rooms but very clean and in a great area of the city. There is a beauty supply store on the corner that is worth checking out, huge assortment from shampoos to odd knick knacks. Don’t bother with the restaurant, the Tick Tock i think it’s called, juice is from a bottle, nothing fresh, over priced, terrible coffee, but the scene is fun to watch.;3
When you pay this much for a hotel you expect absolute top service. When we arrived the staff at reception were nonchalant, rather than welcoming. We were also surprised with a $25 fee Per night fee for use of facilities (which includes the business centre and gym both of which we have no intention of using on a holiday) and were told it was mandatory. There is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room and we only discovered on the last night that you are able to ask for a coffee maker to be sent to your room - I only discovered this as I was feeling unwell and asked for hot water - it took 45 minutes for the machine to be delivered to the room. Water pressure in shower is poor and water gets colder as the day goes by. Despite all this the location is fantastic, the beds are;2
The suite was nice and clean.  The location very convenient to shopping, theater and restaurants.  The staff was friendly and efficient.;4
The hotel was very clean and organized. The staff was very helpful and nice to work with.  The hotel was in a perfect location to all the attractions that I visited.;5
This location is all about proximity to Jacob Javits Center, just a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. The TRATTORIA BIANCA was a surprise, I enjoyed several evening meals at reasonable prices and better than average service. The Tick Tock breakfast restaurant was also better than anticipated, I enjoyed a very good bagel with loxs. This location meets or exceeds my business travel needs.;5
Before you get into the building, good luck finding a spot to pull off to unload or get valet parking - there is a very small spot that was full the entire time I was there. First thing to be aware of once you get inside is that the property has a $25/night (+tax) facility/resort fee.  This was a little surprising.  The rooms are tiny-tiny, about 15'x15'.  There was not enough room to have the desk chair pulled out and still open the door.  The small-ness wasn't all bad, especially considering it's NYC and a very old building.  What was bad was the archaic plumbing in the shower.  There were separate hot and cold valves with no ability to pick a temperature and stick with it.  During a 20 minute shower the temperature would swing from scaling hot to tepid cold requiring;3
We stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker for 3 nights in December.  I asked for an Empire State Building view, which was accommodated. We stayed in room 2222.  I believe it was a metro view double room.  It was very large for my family of 4.  Beds were comfy and bathrooms were of an OK size.  This hotel is extremely busy.  The staff was not friendly.  When we checked out, we had to wait an hour for our car to take us to the airport.  During this time, my 6 year old son had to use the restroom.  We waited for 25 minutes in line for security to give us a card to use the bathroom. You need a card to get to the bathrooms!  I wouldn't recommend this hotel to friends or family.  The friendliest employees of this hotel were the housekeepers!;3
I was in NY for a trade Show for several days, my room was neat and clean and staff was very attentive. Look forward to staying here again;4
We were checked in by Mohammed, who was extremely efficient, Great Hotel, yes the rooms were small, however the beds and pillows are very comfortable, but a fabulous location, near Madison Square Gardens, Macys, Penn Station and the Red bu routes, easy walking distance to Times Square and Broadway. Both restaurants on site are very good, and the Italian a life saver after a long day out, with a good meal and wine on the doorstep. If you have booked here you will not be disappointed, and free wifi. One tip when out and about eating ask what is their service charge, it could add an extra 20% to it, we were caught and it added another 75 dollars to our bill.;4
A beautiful hotel. But our room was too small. There was 2 of us and no room for 2 suitcases, but it was clean and beds were comfortable. Bathroom a bit out dated and tiny. Just too small for 2 people. They SAID we couldn't upgrade, no rooms available. Staff were all nice. Great location. Also our room had no coffee pot so they did get us one but then the maids never gave us any more coffee or cups and we slept there for 4 nights. Starbucks across the street however but always nice to have a cup when you get up 😕;4
While the New Yorker has a good location, the rest of the experience doesn't live up to Wyndham's supposed 4-star rating for this hotel (though inflated star ratings seem to be common throughout the chain). The front desk staff here is only efficient, but not friendly, and long lines pervade check-in and bag check. The rooms are smaller than one would expect, even for a hotel in New York, and the furnishings are low-quality and sometimes in disrepair.;2
Location is great yes it could use a little sprucing but the people working there are great The desk the front door  the  maids etc were all great very considerate  helpful.I would  definitely stay there again;4
Just come back from 5 days in this hotel. Great location for midtown Manhattan. Quick and efficient check-in, friendly staff. Rooms are a little dated, although more than adequate for a base to explore the surroundings. The first 18 floors are leased out to student accommodation, and the rest attracts a good mix of business and tourists. Good Wi-fi in the room that we stayed in on 19th floor, although resort fee was high for the use that we got, although full business centre and fitness facilities are included as well as all phone calls.;4
Originally built in 1929 and retaining many original features from that period the hotel is well managed and comfortable. The front of house amenities and staff are all very good, particularly good service from all the staff who are friendly and helpfull. The lower level and restrooms contain a small and informative museum telling the story of The New Yorker from first being built to the present day. This area has period recordings in the background from programmes that were broadcast from the hotel during the 30's and 40's, it's a pity that these recordings aren't played in the lobby area  as this is more in keeping with the overall ambiance of the Art Deco lobby than the classical music selection which is currently played. The attached Tik Tok 24 hour diner serves a good;4
This hotel was chosen due to its location being central as this was a dinner function my company was hosting. The hotel sales manager was great and everything went extremely well. The room I stayed in was upgraded and had an awesome view. I was not able to take full advantage of the nearby shopping but it is  definitely where you would want to stay if that's your aim. The room was clean and had a luxurious feel. I would highly recommend.;5
Our room had the best view of the Empire State building all lit up in red and green for the holiday. We loved being on the 21st floor because the elevator went from floor 20 up so we were able to go up and down quickly. The location was wonderful. We could walk to Times Square, Broadway shows, Macy's and more. I liked the security where we had to show our room key to access the elevator banks. The hotel also let us check in early which was great. We were there to watch our son march in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade so the hotel was a great location for getting to a great spot on the parade route.;5
The location of the hotel is wonderful if you plan to attend an event at Madison Square Garden.  If not, it's a taxi ride to attractions, good restaurants, and shopping.  The lobby was bustling with travelers and the lines were long at check in.  We had to check our bags since our room was not ready, and we waited in a long line to retrieve our luggag once the room was ready.  Our room was small but clean.  It had a small living area with a sofa, desk and television along with a coffee maker.  The bedroom was small too with a very comfortable bed and mattress.  There was construction and scaffolding outside our windows, so we kept the drapes closed.  The bathroom was adequate, but the low pressure shower head with little warm water was unpleasant.  I don't think there was heat;3
Great Location.  Clean, nice room.  Courteous and friendly staff.  Highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Manhattan!  As a first time visitor I selected this hotel based on its proximity to a subway station.  It was a great choice on my part.;5
This hotel is old-fashioned but cosy and comfortable - a great location. The best thing about the hotel is the attitude of the members of staff because they are without exception extremely polite and helpful. It felt like good old-fashioned service ! The rooms are pretty basic but clean and comfy. I loved the old style and architecture and the very convenient diner next door.  For people travelling alone this hotel I a good, safe choice. I would book another stay here...;4
Would recommend this Hotel for how central it is and the staff are pleasant and helpful other than the adjoining cafe/bar where the blond Lady behind the bar doesn't like her job or people!. The rooms are not big but more than OK and the facilities are clean. Is short other than just one miserable/rude member of staff behind the bar and the unexpected surcharge for facility's advised on their website with no reference to extra fees and the are we had no need or use of them somewhat goes against this Hotel is GREAT;3
Quick reception & check in, and gave us an amazing room with a fabulous view, couldn't of picked better ourselves.  We were returning for our anniversary after getting married there last December.  Location is the best, had several breakfasts at the Tic tock diner.  Felt very safe with the security.  The cleaning of the room was an excellent service, as always.  Will definitely return for a third time as soon as we can!! Love it.;5
We stayed here in November for three nights, this Art Deco hotel is beautiful.  We had a family room with two double beds - the room wasn't big, but you are only there to sleep! The room was cleaned every day - hair dryer is kept on the back of the bathroom door in a bag!  The only downside to the hotel is the wifi - they give you a password at check in, but forget to tell you they charge $22 per day!! We only found out on leaving as a statement was pushed under our door (payment has already been taken of the card details given on check in ) . All the staff are lovely and friendly, always happy to help.   I would definitely stay here again! :);5
Recently stayed at Wyndham New Yorker, the bedroom was extremely small and because there was a heavy desk against the window, the curtain would only pull halfway across.  The view seemed to be of other rooms which I could see into when the lights were on so I had to move the desk in order to block their view into my room.  The bed was very comfortable although the room itself was small and extremely cold at night.  I did ask for another blanket which was supplied immediately on request.  The bathroom was very cramped and dated. Luckily I was the sole occupant as I doubt you could get two into the room at the same time.  Location was good, the staff were friendly and the TickTock restaurant was excellent.  Sometimes there was a queue for breakfast but the food and service was;2
I think the rooms need a lot of work to be at the level they charge for. There are lots of paint chips in the shower area and doesn't look well kept up. I couldn't get a steady water temperature for a shower. The first room we stayed in didn't have a shelf in the bathroom or a towel rack so no where to put anything you typically would put in a bathroom. The bathroom size was about the size of a European bathroom at a 2-3 star hotel (hardly much room to even turn around in). The line was long to check in and I saw this line very single day I was here. The same with checking out. I would not recommend this hotel in it's current state.;3
Friendly staff. We arrived early and stopped in to see if they would hold our bags until check-in.  Yes, they were willing to hold our bags, but also offered to let us check in early at no charge. They then upgraded us to a higher room with a better view...also at no charge!  The room was clean and the elevators were fast. We would stay here again without hesitation.;5
Stayed at the New Yorker for 8 Days last week, and was very surprised with the friendly service i received, unlike some other hotels in Manhattan. In particular a lady names Krystal at the front desk was very professional, and even wen as far as arranging a room change, at a moments notice. The only downside to this hotel would be that the rooms are very small. Other than that, very happy with my stay there, and would def stay there again. Thank you Krystal, and the New Yorker team.;4
Great location, within walking distance of Timesquare with subway access on the corner.  Rooms are small but that's what's to be expected in NYC from what I've heard.  It was three of us with 3 large suitcases and it was barely enough room, so go for the suite if you require more space. Bathrooms are clean and the diner in the lobby is awesome.;4
First of all, I actually like the location of the hotel. Most of my friends begged me to stay out of the general Times Square area but I am bullheaded so I booked anyway. I wasn't disappointed by its proximity to Broadway, which was my most important consideration. Though if you want family-friendly, relatively cleaner, and attractive scenery this is not the hotel for you. As for the staff, people in New York aren't the most warm and welcoming but I received decent treatment during my stay.  The room I booked (the New Yorker Suite) was adequate. As expected, it was compact compared to other hotel suites and the bathroom was small (I'm Asian so that's saying something).;3
This was our second time staying at the New Yorker: the location is great - across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden and a subway stop. The rooms aren't huge but they are clean and the beds are comfortable (and who spends much time in their room when visiting New York?). The entire staff was friendly and helpful - and they even upgraded us to a room with a view of the Empire State Building - for free!;5
Had a great stay for thanksgiving week. Room on 35th floor looking west out to Hudson River. Really quiet room. 4 of were comfortable and had Good sleep in comfy beds after a hard days shopping. TV was good and watched some movies. Loves the old style mixed with modern especially the art deco and so many retained details. Will definitely recommend a stay here and would stay here again. Staff very friendly.;4
I spent a week in NYC and found this hotel to be a great central location, Very close to the subway, MSG & time Square. The hotel was always clean and the presence of the staff in the lobby 24hrs a day gave it a very secure feel.;4
My experience was great, room was fantastic and room service was prompt. A great room in a good location, also the price was great. I would definitely come back again and stay here, the ambience was great and I enjoyed my stay;4
The hotel is very out dated,4 ladies went in one room beds very small, it was my 70th bday I would have thought thy would hav given us  nice room but we were room 2597 overlooking sum building work going on we could see cranes but as you are out most of the time it dosen't seem to matter , we were what seem to be near a lift the noise was awful they never seem to stop going up & down all night. When we went to our room there weren't any coffee/ tea facilities we rang asked reception for some 2hrs later it arrived but it wasn't replenished we went and bought milk sugar. Do not bother going on a dinner river cruise not worth the money poor service and very cold on the boat. 41 dollars for a bottle of what seem to be a cheap wine. The best thing was the show Peter pan and 9/11 very;3
"When I checked in I was told that my room was ""much bigger"" than I'd originally reserved and had an ""empire state"" view. Much bigger seems to be a little deceptive since the room was very cramped feeling, right down to the half sized desk where you could only pull the chair up to the end. There were narrow paths around the beds and that was the ONLY open space in the room. The dresser/desk combo was metal framed and looked pretty industrial (old not chic). The bathroom was also small and was tiled in 4 inch square tile like that used in the '60s. I wonder what color it originally was because it was PAINTED white. Very surprised to see that a hotel renovated the bathrooms by painting over the old ceramic tile.   Worse yet, NO COFFEE in the room. I suppose there wasn't much room";3
VERY RUDE receptionist helped us when we checked in.If we did not already pay in full we would have left and gone to another hotel.Felt very unwelcome.Average rooms, old mouldy bathrooms.Definitely NOT a 4 star hotel.There is no coffee/tea facilities in the room.No bar fridge.Very dissapointed.;2
My stay at the New Yorker was extremely good, the location perfect and all staff so friendly.  HOWEVER, more than a week after check out, this hotel has still failed to re-debit my account with over £1500!   I have paid for my stay, had to endure multiple conversations with clueless financial staff members and with still no resolution! I have paid for this room and with no prior warning I am now facing financial repercussions!  I chose this hotel because it was affordable and a great location! Only 50% of this I can now say to be true!  £1500 short at Christmas is NOT acceptable. Be warned!!;2
Came here for 4 days with my mother & my friend for a shopping trip, I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. When you're on a shopping trip you're probably not going to be spending a lot of time in your room but when you do they're lovely. A bit on the small side but the beds are comfortable, remade daily and the room cleaned.  We stayed in room 3124 and I had my fingers crossed that we'd have a nice view, it didn't disappoint. Right out the window was the Empire State Building.  The bathroom again was a little on the small side but the shower made up for that, the power from it was like being exfoliated daily!  The hotel team are so friendly and welcoming and nothing seems like too much trouble to ask. If you get a chance take the escalator from the lobby and have a look at;5
We booked a room with a view and what a view it was - the Hudson River at it's very best! As for location, we couldn't have asked for anything better. We were a stones throw away from Maidson Square Garden and a short walk from the Empire State, along with Penn Station being at our door step. If you get the chance, definitely try the Tick Tock diner for breakfast, their pancakes are incredible. The only negative of our trip was the size of the room, maybe it was the fact we were on the highest floor but it was a lot smaller than the photos show. However, the room was impeccably clean and if we'd have asked to change room I'm sure the answer would've been yes as the staff were exceptionally nice and welcoming.;4
This was my first time visiting New York we were welcomed by lovely smiley staff rooms where abit smaller than pictures but are view was absolutely amazing! Tick tock restaurant attached to the hotel was lovely amazing staff! On the last day we was waiting for transfers the guy on the desk refused to phone as he has been in the situation before and he told me the transfer had to b re called 48 hours before, then the lovely John phoned them for piece of mind it didn't come but he made sure we got to the airport on time for our flight!! Would definitely return hotel was a fab location!!;4
Over priced- dirty, old rooms, mouldy bathroom, cold rooms, drafty windows, smelly bathroom, charges for 'service' 27 dollars a day, rude staff, small toiletries. Be aware price on booking.com will be vastly inflated when you check out (4 types of taxes, and service charge). I have stayed elsewhere in New York ie the kimpton hotels and have not felt ripped off like here. Do not book!!!!;1
I found the room clean, well furnished and quite nice.  As a historic property, the room was slightly smaller than what may be expected in a more modern facility, but had been nicely refurbished.  The proximity to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and Herald Square made this a nice midtown choice for my stay.  I would certainly stay here again.;5
Stayed for Thanksgiving week, walking distance to Times Square, Macy's & many great restaurants. Very old bathroom, but it was clean & everything worked.  Amenities said Keurig in room- not ours!  Very friendly staff.  Restaurant is basic greasy spoon & a bit over priced for the quality.;4
1st time visit was great, 2nd time was horrible with my luggage situation and how things were handled overall, and 3rd trip started off terrible-you would think that what happened on my second visit that they were not give me a a terrible experience for this trip. Check in was horrible with their service.Tried charging me 75 dollars early check in with knowledge of my bad experience the last time I was there.  The manager was supposed to call me in regards to this but never did.  I had to call several hours later to complain about the service upon check in and not getting a call back.  The manager took off the 75 dollars, I was happy about this.  I was just hoping to get better service upon check in.  I should not have to start off my vacation upset. I love the location but with;3
This was our second stay at the New Yorker. The location is super-convenient in midtown across from Penn Station. The art-deco style is a trip back in time but it is the opposite of dilapidated...spotlessly clean and well-maintained. Service is very professional. We will surely be back.;5
Stayed for 6 nights - location is fab down 8th so about 10-15 min walk to 42nd street then the madness begins..  If you want to be out the business of Times Square then this location is perfect. Along the road from Macy's and Empire State Building - you might be lucky to get a view of the ESB unfortunately we didn't which was disappointing - I had emailed twice to there customer services to ask for a room with a view and to advise them it was a special occasion (65th birthday for mum) no replies to emails and no special view room or surprise.. Pretty poor show. Tick tock diner was good for breakfast we ate there a few times and also had coffee from the cart in the lobby which was lovely and nice pastries;3
You can't deny the charm of the building, but rooms are so run down small and antiquated it really should be maximum a 2 or 3 star property. Staff is great but they can't help the state of the building. At almost $375 it's absolute horrible value for money even for NYC.;2
After reading mixed reviews, I was unsure what to expect, however, the Hotel really delivered.  Our room was more than spacious, 4 travelers with 2 double beds, and 2 bathrooms in the room.  The room was spotlessly clean, and was cleaned daily to a high standard.  Location wise the hotel is perfect, close to all local attractions.  All staff were well turned out, and more than polite.  The ticktock diner is overpriced, breakfast for 4 would set us back $70-80.  The food is ok, just diner standard, there are better about.  Trattoria Bianca is a different story, excellent food, with great staff.  A great place for a few drinks or an evening meal.  I had the best steak I've ever had there.  The cowboy rib.  please try it!  I couldn't have asked for much more from the hotel, and;5
We just came back from last weekender trip to NYC. We stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel the staff especially Mohammad and Susanna were very accommodating and helpful.  Mohammad especially was very attentive to our needs when we checked in. The hotel is very nice and the lobby was very grand looking.  Also this property is a landmark for NYC.  The location couldn't be better right next to subway and Macy's  The rooms were very clean and tidy and I had a nice view of the city in the 33rd floor.  you must have breakfast at the Tick Tock Diner very good breakfast food and great service also a must try is the Skylight Diner across the Street.  For the one of the best deli  try the Stage Door Deli amazing corn beef sandwiches and the best NYC cheesecake.  A tip for cheap airport;4
Pretty much what you'd expect for a midtown hotel. Rooms were small and dated, we would have had a superb view of the Empire State Building and 34th street but it was obstructed by scaffolding! Check in was quick and efficient and staff were always very polite, easy to get a taxi outside and location was perfect for us.;3
Great friendly staff, very clean room and attentive staff.  Found the hotel easily, but parking was a nightmare!  Had to pay for covered parking which was not disclosed on the hotels website.  Extra pillows provided and late check out offered!;4
My company was in town for the dental conference and we booked 4-night stay for four employees at the normal price ( many people staying in that hotel got our rooms for cheaper ). Not only were the rooms very small, almost closet sized space but when I went to front desk to ask for a double bed room or an upgrade. The management and front staff were the worst. Now I know never to use this hotel to book my employees ever again. Thank you for the bad experience.;3
Excellent hotel - with exquisite views, very clean, very well located in the center of NY - near top points of interest&means of transportation, great and helpful service, customer oriented management! Definitely we will come back in our next trips!;5
"The location is really great - the hotel seems old but it doesn't feel like it. It's huge, and to get to the room is like walking through a maze, but the room itself was just fine, clean, comfy. No coffee in the room though. They charge a fixed $25 ""service"" fee which is annoying (why charge extra through the backdoor instead of part of the room's cost?). At the lobby they have a small coffee stand which saves the need to go out in the cold in the morning for a coffee.";4
Stayed here 3 nights in November as part of a cruise package. This hotel is in a great location for a stay in New York .  Hotel is very large and very busy,with a lovely reception area. The room although quite small had all you needed for a short stay. Bed although was a double size was very comfortable and room was kept nice and clean. Shower was very good with lots of power. The diner and the trattoria within the hotel were very good. The lifts were security checked and very fast considering the number of floors covered. Wifi was very good would stay again if in New York.;4
My sister in law & myself enjoyed our stay at The New Yorker. The only complaint we shared was that our room & bathroom was very small.  There was no fridge, microwave, or ice machine on our floor. The housekeeping staff, hotel staff & the restaurant & bar staff incredible. And we thank all of them for taking such good care of us while we were there.;3
Exceptional service..every effort made to provide us with best experience imaginable. Location perfect as base to explore the amazing city if you are feeling lazy be aware that madison square gardens and macys store within 200 yards.Strongly recommend. Great idea to start with breakfast at ticktock diner attached to hotel. Enough energy from breakfast to keep you going all day!!;5
We stayed here for 5 nights and can't really fault it. The hotel was lovely and the staff were all very friendly & helpful.   The rooms are compact but have everything you need. There's a dinner for breakfast although we'd recommend heading out and about. The restaurant is really nice & well worth a visit.   Location wise you could be much more central and with Penn station right next doors it's so easy to get everywhere.   Make sure take some comfy shoes!;4
great hotel clean rooms great service next door to Madison square garden  great for site seeing the empire state building tick tock restaurant great for food next door to hotel and time square all within walking distance;4
Great location, great service. Originally booked a metro view double room online . When we got to the room the view was somewhat obscured by scaffolding. Spoke to the front desk and they agreed to move us the next morning as soon as another room was cleaned. Second room was much nicer and clear view of Empire State Building. Would have do rated 5 if we had the view room for the whole week.;4
This room was satisfying to my liking. Wyndham hotels have amazingly beautiful rooms and their amenities are always satisfying.They always give my family what they desire and treat them with respect. I would consider coming back to this hotel when traveling with my family.;5
Enjoyed an outstanding stay in the metropolis of the world on Thanksgiving day and you can set the record straight, it was really nice and outstanding service@ The New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan;5
Wonderful experience at this hotel. I cannot say enough about the manager! He's so helpful! Whatever you need, just ask! We will definitely be back!!!!!;5
We have stayed at the New Yorker several times this year and never been disappointed.  The staff always goes the extra mile.  Walking distance to the Thanksgiving Parade.;5
Myself, my husband and my 16 year old neice had a split visit to this hotel end Nov/beg Dec and have to say first of all the location is amazing! It It is within walking distance to a lot of the big attractions like Empire State Building, Macy's and Times Square (all less than 10 mins walk) with Madison Square Garden right across the road. Subway and bus stops right outside hotel and Penn Station a 2 minute walk. The rooms are very comfortable and clean (we had a newly refurbished room for both visits). Bathrooms are fairly small but ample. Staff were friendly enough but sometimes we felt they were lacking in effort. When we returned for our second visit we were placed in a room on 7th floor which was above the diner and there seemed to be a stale food smell lingering in the;4
We stayed on 35th floor, the view was just gorgeous. The room was very small but that's to be expected. The room was clean and nicely decorated. Would definitely recommend. The lobby was done up for Christmas really well. Most of the staff were lovely.;5
We stayed here for three nights over Thanksgiving and could not have been more pleased. The location was great, as we arrived by Penn station, and just walked over to our hotel with our rolling bags. It is also central to just about all of the tourist attractions in the area - Times Square, Macy's, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Flatiron, etc.  The subway entrance is just outside the revolving doors to the hotel, so getting around was very easy from here. The staff was very helpful, and also very good at ensuring that you have true access to the hotel - as security during this time was very tight. The rooms are dated, but polished up. This is an old world hotel, so don't expect a lot of wasted floor space. We did not have the best view from the window, but in fact, I;5
Not bad at all, the bed is very very comfortable and have the Tick Tick diner in the hall is surely an advantage. Considering the central position of the hotel and the cost , i would recomend it......;4
By far the best thing about this hotel is the Location - you are 5mins from Macys & other great shops and across the street from both Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station. Their diner Tick Tock is also good, food all day and night and the quality and price are reasonable. The gym and business centre are also fine.  Rooms are a bit hit and miss...my sister arrived the night before me and woke up with bites all over her arms, chest and back. They moved us immediately to another room and say they investigated and couldn't find the cause. I have my suspicions! The rooms are old and worn but the rate at the hotel is pretty cheap so i think you get what you pay for. Water pressure and temperature were both good in the room and so was the wifi.  The hotel is huge, separate banks of;3
Third visit to the New Yorker in 6 years. Absolutely excellent experience once again.  No complaints what so ever. Great for tourists wanting to see the city. A block away from Madison Square Garden and only a few blocks from Times Square.  Never had a chance to eat at the Tick Tock diner this time around as we were pushed for time but last time it was excellent. McDonalds, Starbucks etc just across the street and loads of other varied eateries within striking distance.  Port Authority bus station just a few blocks away with coaches to Woodbury Common Shopping Village which is DEFINITELY worth a visit. UGG, Levi's, Armani, Tommy Hilfiger, North Face, Nike, Michael Kors and hundreds more are all there with what can only be described as rock bottom prices!!;5
"I stayed here for business in November because my company did not provide another option. Being a former resident in the city I did not expect this property to provide above the average service or ambiance. It was sufficient for a one-night business trip stay - efficient check-in and clean (small room and very cold bathroom) room; however, finance does not work well. I called the hotel twice in the past week asking someone to email me the folio so I can submit my expenses. One lady took my information after asking me to spell my name and email address about five times, and I still do not have the simple folio email I had requested. Truly beyond comprehension. This is an economical option for a family trip if no one will spend much time at the hotel or if you have a tight budget";3
Love this hote. The location is great.Easy to walk to times sq and all attractions. The tick tock diner is very good and easy for breakfast but still right over the road is other restaurants also. The rooms are quite  small but why do you need an large room when visiting NYC!;5
Right beside Madison Square Gardens & very close to Empire State Building, Macys & Times Square.  The hotel itself was busy but well organised. We were on the 36th floor with great views. Room was small but enough space for everything with a digital safe & a big comfy bed.  We went to tick tock a 24 hour diner that you had access to from the hotel lobby for our breakfast every morning...once you try this place with it's great food & service at a good price you won't want to go anywhere else.  Would recommend to anyone & if we go back to NY would stay here again.;5
"Stayed for 4 nights with the family, was on the 23rd floor, room 2109, it was very clean and cosy, the only thing that was bad was the one window that let a really bad draft through and made it very cold.  The hotel sells tickets for the bus tours and they sell them cheaper than the guys that work on the streets, as they work on commission they add $10-$20 extra so buy them from the hotel. Also had to pay an extra £90 when we arrived for the ""hotel services"" so when they say wifi is free, technically it isn't.";4
Just finished with our second stay.  This time we got a large room and it was nice.  The beds were very comfortable!  Bathroom still small and worn.  The staff is friendly and security is tight.  My daughter left her pillow and I called them for help!  They were very good and responsive.  They held her pillow at the front desk!  Good location to MSG and a few blocks to Times Square.  It's nice to have the 24 hour diner and a full service restaurant.   We will stay again next year!;4
Our room was not ready when we arrived so they upgraded us and gave us a larger room.  The room was not one of the ones that had been updated but the bathroom was very clean and the linens and beds were clean.;5
This was our first ever visit to nyc and the hotel certainly didn't disappoint. We arrived Sunday 22/11 at around 130pm and after a swift check in went straight to our room, with a view of the Empire State, there was scaffolding up outside our window but this was no  Biggy.  Having had no transfers from the airport we got the shuttle bus for 21 dollars each which was great. On the way back we purchased tickets from pen station for 12 dollars each, also easy and much cheaper than a taxi!   The room, yes it was fairly small, however safe in wardrobe and more than enough storage for both me & my partner. Bathroom, yes a little dated, who cares, the shower was powerful & everything did the trick. Hairdryer also included and an alarm clock which was a nice touch.  As is apparent on;5
Visited here in September as part of a once in a lifetime trip to the USA and Canada.  We were met at reception by Mohammed who saw that I had emailed the hotel in advance to say that this was a special holiday.  He immediately upgraded our room to one with a view of the Empire State Building!  Priceless.  Great location.  Nice rooms.  All good here.;4
This is my first review ever, about anything, but I strongly feel I have to share this experience with other potential hotel customers so that at the very least, they are not sourly surprised like we were. First, I'd like to say that the hotel's location in Midtown Manhattan is very good and it is a historic hotel with a very nice Lobby. Stayed at this hotel because it is a Wyndham hotel and I had never had a bad experience like this one, under the Wyndham flag. There is a musky smell once you get off the elevator that really turns you off as you are led to your minuscule room. My family (13yr son, 16yr daugther, wife and myself) literally had to take turns and coordinate ourselves to move about the room.  This room is aprox. 10'x11' with two full sized beds, counter for TV set;1
Have stayed in a lot of hotels in NYC but chose this one because of proximity to the convention center. As I was here for a convention. What a nice old fashion deco hotel that is upgraded.  Nice job Wyndam! Small rooms and bathrooms (think Europe),but I was alone so no problem.  Very clean, comfortable beds, cool decor. Great service at front desk. If you are here for theater it couldn't be more convenient. A lot hotel for the price.;4
Hotel has a neat history and the lobby is really cool. Our room was small and the bathroom was extremely tiny and needed renovation. It had a fairly recent WC but the tiles looked original and had been painted over. The bathtub was from the 50's. Shower head leaked. Our floor smelled of smoke when we checked in, we complained and to Wyndham's credit the smell was gone by the next day. It appears the hotel rooms start at floor 19. Below that it seemed as though some of the floors were for long term residents - a good number of college kids get of the elevator on  the lower floors with take out. One said he is going to Columbia. Concierge was very helpful. Location is great if you come to NYC on AMTRAK to Penn Station.;3
Great location - a stone`s throw from the Empire State Building. Loads of art deco charm in the rooms, lobby, lifts etc. Tick Tock diner open 24 hours a bit pricey but service rapid. Hotel staff very charming and friendly. Rooms small but nicely styled. A better bet for breakfast is the small stall in the lobby selling fresh pastries and coffee. Guy selling excursions on the info desk is excellent - like an extra from the Sopranos. Recommended if you want memories of the right kind.;4
Not bad hotel good location the room are a little smaller but the bathroom is nice with the heat on the floor. Very convenient for an NYC hotel. The area is good, near from everything time square. The building are a little old.;4
This hotel is in an excellent location in the middle of the city.  The price is right, the lobby is OK, and the restaurant is OK, too.  Our bedroom was facing the Empire State Building, that gave it a nice view but we asked for Queen bed, and they gave us a Double bed.;3
Pretty much a short walk to most of the main attractions in Manhattan. If you score a deal on a room then you'll really luck out. The rooms are normally pricey, but that's what you expect to pay for a good hotel in a great location.;4
Travelled to New York end of October for the New York Marathon with family of four.  The New Yorker is a fabulous Art deco hotel with lots of history.  Our first night was a little rocky.  Our room was incredibly small, and the shower didn't work.  We were so impressed with the front desk staff when we put our complaint in.  They were incredibly helpful and had us moved into a larger room with an incredible view the next evening no questions asked.  We know they were very busy this weekend and they went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable.  The New Yorker is across the street from Madison Square Garden, which is a top notch facility, I would recommend taking in a sporting event, so fun! We were within walking distance to Times Square, as well the Subway was right;4
"Recently stayed at the New Yorker Hotel in November 2015 for 3 days on a business trip. The guest in the room next to mine was smoking during my entire stay and the smoke was permeating into my room.  I have Reactive Airway Disease and cigarette smoke is a trigger.  I phoned guest services daily and reported this.  They sent security up and I was informed they could smell the smoke however, there is nothing they could do unless they are ""caught"" smoking.  I stopped at the front desk on several occasions and again no attempt to correct the problem.  I was only able to stay in my room to sleep and had to leave the room and complete my computer and administrative work elsewhere.  The day I was departing I left 5 hours prior to my flight   because I could not tolerate the smoke.  I";1
Stayed here again, think thats my 20th time now! Just love the location and the feel of this place. Rooms spotless, cleaned everyday. Plenty of towels and complimentary wash goods. Tick Tock Diner - getting abit over priced for what you get, there a far better places dotted around. Brilliant location for Penn Station - takes less than 30 mins by train to JFK or Newark.;5
Very well located opposite Penn Station and Times square.  We were lucky to get a suite on the 38th floor with a great view. Leaving cases was a problem with a very long line of quests trying to leave their case and it cost $2 each case. Be aware of the daily charge, never come across this before. Lots of places to eat just down the road.;4
Room was a Queen room, number 2015, felt very claustrophobic but very clean, No tea/coffee making facilities which was dissapointing. A definite NO NO, DO NOT use hotel Concierge Theatre Booking Facilities, we booked to see Jersey Boys which being our Anniversary were prepared to pay as a treat, we paid $129.95 each for our tickets with $2.00 handling fee ($261.90total), yes we were told they use a booking agent so appreciated that some money would go to them but when we picked our tickets up before the show, the actual face value was only $62.00 each. Complained to the hotel Theatre booking Concierge at the fact we paid more than double the value and that was daylight robbery but very indignant response, 'No refunds regardless, that's what we charge through our booking agent'.;4
This was definitely a great room but my biggest knock--though not unexpected given it's NYC--was that it was a pretty tiny room. I was there for two nights to attend a Microsoft event and the location was prime: just two blocks from the event's location (Moynihan Station). Would definitely stay again.;5
Slightly below average hotel. Good location and nice enough lobby and entrance, but that's where it ends. Rooms could be cleaner and more money could be spent on better mattresses and linens. Old ,hard and uncomfortable with a dirty feel. Also I asked three times for a spare cot and was told it would be right up, but we never saw it.  Wasted some time waiting initially. On the other hand every staff member was professional and friendly.;3
Friendly staff, even helped me when I left our room (on 23rd floor) to use business centre on ground floor and then forgot what room I was in!  Rooms large though a bit dated but beds soooo  comfy, plenty of hot water and decent shower. Don't know if it's the same every where but there was no tea/coffee making facilities. But we couldn't fault the hotel. May not be all singing,all dancing but suited us.;5
Staying at the Wyndham New Yorker for 4 nights, room is very very small with no amenities.  No fridge, no coffee, plastic beakers and room very cold.  The Tick Tock restaurant which is attached to the hotel offers very good food but the service is indifferent bordering on surly, but a tip of 20 per cent is still expected.;2
The New Yorker was everything we had hoped for, except it was extremely busy. It makes sense because the hotel is located in Time Square with the subway station - 34th and Penn just around the corner.   When we first arrived at the hotel after our red-eye flight around 8:00 am, we noticed a lot of people were standing around the lobby. There was a lot of hustle and bustle happening. As we approached the front desk, we checked in, but they let us know we would not have a room until after 2:00 pm. My boyfriend and I were a bit freaked out by this statement because we did not want to carry our luggage around the city.   The Front Desk staff told us we could hold our luggage with the bell desk for free. She was very nice, even though I knew she was stressed and busy, and she took;4
The hotel is in a very good location, but everything is very old (carpet, paint, etc) and the room that they gave us was very small, the person from the front desk told us he was going to give us an upgrade and it seemed more like a joke he gave us the smallest room ( in a corner) with two doors fom other rooms very near so we could hear a lot of noise from the people entering and exiting their rooms near by, not a very pleasant stay;3
Loved staying here - cosy rooms, nice, grand feeling to the place. Right in the heart of where everything is happening and most main attractions are only a few short steps away. Really gave me the feeling of being in the midst of all the hustle and bustle. Rooms were very clean and well cared for.;5
We had a room on 25th floor ...a corner room with 2 Windows  and a Hudson River view ,room was small but adequate for my daughter and myself  Bed was comfortable but very high  Bathroom small and needed updating no tea or coffee in room but we took our own travel kettle and coffee.  We ate in the tick tick diner which was good  All staff were helpful we had a fab break and would stay there again;4
14 of us headed to New York on the 3rd of Nov 2015.we ranged from 15 to 60 in age.we arrived at the hotel all excited.check in was fast enough .we all headed to our rooms .on arrivals to rooms were there was 4 adults in each two of the rooms we got were extremely small..there should of been only one double bed in the room as we couldn't move in the room.we went to reception straight away and we change our room .reception dealt with us very politely.our room was a lot bigger with two bathrooms and lots of room which was fantastic.the hotel itself was very central to the Empire State Building,Macy's and time square .its in a great location.very near port of authority aswell.there is an extra charge on the rooms which is a bit expensive as the internet wasn't great and we didn't;4
I stayed here for three nights with my brother in September. We visited NYC so we could see Billy Joel play at MSG.   The hotel is perfectly situated for MSG and is very handy for all the other must see sights in NYC.   This was my fifth trip to NY and my brothers first. This was my second stay in the New Yorker - my first stay was in 2004.  The hotel has definitely improved since my first stay.   Our room was more than adequate and we were grateful that the staff took our request for a twin room seriously.   We only stayed for three nights and we appeared to visit at the same time as a Rocky Horror convention was taking place? It didn't effect us at all but led to some 'interesting' sights in the lobby :o)  We ate in the Tick Tock diner and had a great breakfast - our server;5
We only stopped one night, Location is excellent right next to penn station and a 10-20min walk to most attractions and sights, the building interior is classic 20s style, staff were helpful, our room was on the 24th floor it was small and nothing special and the bathroom needed updating and a better shower. For the reputation and price we expected more.;3
Stayed at this fantastic hotel from 18th-23rd November, What an amazing location. Penn station main entrance is 2 mins walk from the hotel with Times Square, Empire State Building and Macy's all within a short walk. If your looking for a clean, comfortable hotel that is a perfect base to explore what the city has to offer then this is the place for you. All the staff here were so helpful and after checkout they have a secure room you can store your bags for $2 per bag... Can't wait to return.;5
Great location and value.  Many dining, entertainment, and lots of New York at its finest nearby!;4
Room was very dated and  the bathroom was awful. Shower was hot or cold, no in between. For $300+ per night I expect a decent shower.;2
The only good about this hotel is the location. When you view the pictures of the rooms & hotel it looks great but in person it's a major disappointment. The room is very small and tight as well as the bathroom you barley have any room to do your business the tv is small the prices are high. The hotel charges an additional 27 nightly because of their self proclaimed great wifi and other b.s amenities. This place nickels & dimes their customers you get charged a 2 dollar fee just to leave your luggage for a few hours after check out. If you have money to blow this is the place to stay.;2
I stayed here on business, my first time in NYC and the hotel was fantastic. Rooms: massive. Lots of space, wide variety of tv channels and a slight view on Madison Square Garden. The bed was comfy and the whole hotel was very clean and bright. Building: inside, it's very lovely. Big, but attractive. The meeting rooms were either very warm or very cold at any given time though, so I'd take that into account if you are going for that reason. Obviously as it's NYC it is very noisy all night long. Location: perfect. You can walk to Time Square in minutes and there are plenty of shops, bars and restaurants nearby with Penn Station across the street. Restaurant: I ate in the Tick Tock diner which is connected and, whilst basic, it is very nice and a great place for American diner;5
Bit doubtful after reading reviews, but pleasantly surprised. Very pleasant helpful lady on reception, room not ready til 3pm, but kept our cases until then. Nice room, reasonably spacious, clean, good shower. Very helpful Concierge desk with advice on where to go for bus tour. The hotel is a bit old fashioned, but clean, and superbly placed just two blocks from Times Square, Empire State, Macy`s, and 100 yards from Penn Street Station. Also, Big Bus Tours stop opposite hotel! Very pleased all round;4
I have stayed in this hotel 3 times and I must say each time was a great experience. From the the moment I stepped out of the cab and greeted by the bellhops, great vibes and even more when greeted by the front desk. I have had the chance to have the same guy check me in. His name is Tony Gonzalez and he made me feel not like a guest but like a relative to the Wyndham family. I actually got a chance to visit the Nikola Tesla room on the 33rd floor as well on my last visit, way cool.;5
Centrally located near Penn Station and Madison Square Garden and within easy walking distance of Times Square. The public areas are beautifully restored  and there is an informative museum on the lower level. This is an older hotel with rooms designed for the time period of its construction, so the rooms are smaller. The bathrooms can be particularly tight. That being said, the rooms are comfortable and well appointed. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There is an Italian restaurant and a diner-style restaurant on premises and lots of other restaurants close by.;4
Excellent location for sight seeing, Madison Square Garden over the road, Empire State building close by and few minutes walk to Times Square and bus terminal. Room very clean and adequate. Staff lovely and security tight. Breakfast great in Tick Tock diner but dinner not so good. Art Deco lovely, very pleasant to sit and take in surroundings.;4
I love this hotel! The lobby is a beautiful art-deco style and the rooms are nicely decorated. The beds and linens are very comfortable. The bathroom is a little dated, but the shower' s water pressure blew me away! Our view from the room was magnificent ..... we had a direct view to the Empire Stare Building. The hotel has a 24 hour diner in the lobby, which is a great convenience and the food is really good.;4
I have waited a few weeks to review on trip advisor as I have completed 3 other reviews including the hotels own review and the Wyndham review and was hoping to get a reply from my feedback. Nothing to date so they have not attempted to defend themselves and have obviously accepted my comments. On arrival we queued for around 20mins to be checked in. We booked via Expedia and had completed their room preference questionnaire but these are pointless as the last 3 times we have done this the hotels claimed they had not had any requests from Expedia?? At check in we were informed there was a daily facility charge for the use of the gym and high speed internet. WARNING there is no choice! We had 2 rooms so were charged twice $150! I did explain that we were on holiday and would not;3
The front desk was courteous. The bellmen were very attentive and helpful.  The room was clean.  There is no in room coffee pot but downstairs they had coffee hot and ready all the time so that was no issue.  There is no ice on the floor, but a call to the front desk and a bucket and ice is delivered as a courtesy so this too was just fine!  I had an enjoyable time and the room is a decent size for Manhattan.;4
I arrived at the hotel on a Tuesday at 11am and there was no que to check in, was asked for my credit card in case of any damage deposit and was told that I wouldnt be charged anything extra as the hotel was paid for.  I was booked in for 7 nights and luckily had a room on the 36th floor with a great view of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden! The room itself had 2 double beds, a tiny wardrobe and a bathroom. Slightly dated but that is the draw of an art-deco hotel so no real complaints there.  I used the gymnasium on 2 occasions and although it was quite basic in there, it was better than i expected and not very busy.  The staff in the hotel are very helpful and there is security you show your room key to before going in the lift, i befriended one of the ladies;3
Great looking hotel, lobby looks fantastic as if you had stepped back in time to the 1920's, easy check-in , and an abundance of lifts to access the floors. Room was on the small size, but adequate for the 4 of us, we had two double beds a small closet, and a average sized bathroom with shower cubicle. The T.V. was of a good size, room was well kitted out. The Hotel was well located with Penn station across the road, within short walking distances were many shops, bars and restaurants. there was a diner on the ground floor of the hotel which served a great range of breakfast options well worth a visit. My only negative i have is when checking in the receptionist said we had been upgraded but that upgrade transpired to be the room we booked in the first place, this did not spoil;4
I stayed here to attend a conference in the city and the rate was pretty low which is why I chose it. It was an adequate room, pretty small though. My interactions with their staff were pleasant and they were quick to bring more coffee and water to the room when requested. I don't think I would stay there again even though I really had no complaints.;3
My wife and I stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker in September 2015 for 4 nights.  The room was realtively small but what we were expecting.  It was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom had little accommodation for hanging items or setting anything down. The concierege was very friendly and helpful.  The location was ideal.  About the only complaint we had was there was no express checkout and there were too few staff to accommodate the number of people trying to check out at the same time.  That made for a bad memory to end the trip.;4
Checked in for 4 nights in this hotel. The lobby is very impressive and the rest of the hotel doesn't disappoint.  Our room was lovely, tidied and replenished daily. The lady that checked us in was called Linda and was extremely helpful and polite, easy, smooth checkin.  We couldn't have asked for a better location of the hotel, perfectly placed for sightseeing in walking distance.  A thoroughly enjoyable stay,;5
A very well located at the heart of midtown, clean, however very crowded and old. At one step you could reach to subway, time square is about a km. Needless to say that price benefit ratio is not stasifactory. A bar and a cafe is on either side of the lobby, haven't tried the bar I enjoyed the waffle fries at breakfast. You could reach to every spot very easily.;3
Enjoyed 5 nights at this grand old Art Deco hotel, updated with spacious common areas and modernized rooms and fixtures. At a great location for metro travel and walking around Midtown. Don't miss the downstairs gallery of heyday memories of the '30s and 40s. Attentive staff. A relative bargain (by NYC standards).;5
Mom and I spent some time in the Big Apple after being away for some time. As former New Yorkers, it was a fun trip! While there, we were able to see family in Manhattan and New Jersey. We also loved the history of the New Yorker. Things that we didn't know happened there. Very nice!!;5
"Yes, the price is good but the hotel is awful. It's a good example of ""you get what you pay for.""  I called in advance and was told I could possibly check in early so I took a chance figuring I'd check my luggage if I couldn't then come back later. I arrived at noon on a Saturday. The lobby was mobbed. The line to check looked like more than 20 people. The line to check luggage looked even longer like more than 40 people. I waited about 15-20 minutes in the check-in line and made it to the desk. I was informed I could not check in early. I didn't have time to wait in the luggage check-in line so I left with my luggage.  I returned at 10:30pm and checked in without delay. I went to the elevator and while there were many cars they were very slow to arrive. There were more people";1
Stayed here for a full 7 days fora family holiday to explore New York so did plenty of research before I booked. The location of this hotel made the stay in New York one to remember as it was centrally located for everything from the main attractions to the shopping and restaurants. Very close too to Penn Staton which made it so much better as this is a central hub for trains and the subway. Anybody who moans about the hotels location are moaning for the sake of moaning. We arrived at Newark and within one hour via the NJ transit train between airport and Penn station we were in the hotel. Staff were very pleasant in their welcome and very helpful. Now at this stage be prepared for the reception staff informing you of the local tax which will be added to you bill on departure.;5
We stayed here at the end of October. As it was my birthday, my husband upgraded us to a suite. We had a corner suite on the top floor with views out to the Hudson River, across to Times Square, and also to my favourite, the Chrysler Building. Fantastic hotel, Fantastic service and you must eat in the Tick Tock diner downstairs. It is their own retro diner and it serves up the most magnificent luxury waffles with fresh fruit. Very central location. We visited the high line which is just a few blocks over. Madison Square Gardens are across the road if you have tickets for a show. There is also a museum in the basement telling you all about the hotel and its refurbishments. Muhammed Ali stayed here when he fought Joe Frasier in 1971 so the hotel has a lot of history. There is a;5
Myself and my friends have just returned from a break away in new york. It was the 1st time staying in this hotel and i can honestly say i will definitely be back. Location was in the heart of d city but mostly because of the fantastic service we recived from both Johns who luk after the transport service. We had buked a bus through the hotel to pick us up from the airport which a guy called Jose did. He had said if we needed him again to call so the day before we left, we called and organised for him to bring us bak to the airport. Due to be collected at 3pm, Jose didnt show up and when we called he said he could come. We spoke to both Johns and within 5 minutes they had a shuttle bus outside the hotel ready to pick us up. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. I will;5
"Ok, it's a big and busy hotel, so the lobby will be full now and again, the bell hops busy on occasion and the check-in staff facing a queue from time-to-time. But in my experience the staff are friendly and efficient with ready smiles. Our room was way up high ... something like the 25th floor from memory. It was small (NY hotel rooms are generally small), but not too small for a couple and our 3 cases. But it was clean, it was quiet and we had an unobstructed view down 34th to The Empire State. The location is great. Right across from Penn Station, just down from the Empire State and not too far from one of my new NY ""faves"" The High Line. One word of warning - which we resolved without fuss while we were there - the check in staff tried to apply the resort fee of circa $25";4
This hotel is in a great location for sightseeing, we arrived via Penn Station which is a stone's throw of the hotel.  We found it a central point for walking and picking up the tourist hop on/off bus. Lots of places to eat nearby, Tick Tock was great for breakfast. Hotel was clean and welcoming as were the staff. The room was nice, well equipped but let down by the size and view from the window, a brick wall.  However how much time do you spend in your room when you're in New York?? Wifi was good and all telephone calls were free including international.  We had our luggage stored for the day prior to our late evening flight home at a small reasonable charge.   Overall we a had a comfortable stay here, would definitely return and recommend.;4
I went to New York for the first time by myself back in January, and wanted a hotel that was safe to stay in but in a good location as well so i didn't have to travel as far. Wyndham was by far the best choice i could have made, i arrived really late and i got a free upgrade which was amazing! It was so close to madison square garden and heaps of food places which was really convenient! So close the penn st station which made it so easy to travel places. Shopping was a breeze, as it was literally a 5 minute walk to VS, Macys, and then a further 5 minutes to times square. Best location, best customer service! I got stuck in that crazy blizzard and as i was by myself i was quite scared. The hotel staff went out of their way to let me use their phones to call my transfer service,;4
Do not let the negative reviews here influence you.  Wife and I stayed here for 8 nights for our 25th anniversary.  Room had a GREAT view of New York and ESB.  It was always clean, with a refridgerator, and coffee maker (was put to good use).  Okay it is a bit dated, but it is well maintained and despite the huge crowds it was always clean.  Elevators were plenty and fast.  The staff was always smiling and very knowledgable.  Location can not be beat.  Concierge was truly there for us. As to hotel facility fee, we got to use the business center, room wifi (good reception) but above all free international calls (I could not believe it).  So for us coming from Europe, we more than recovered the facility fee just from the phone calls.  All in all they took great care of us and;5
Excellent hotel, conveniently located, great staff. Note, while the rates are very attractive, there is a $25 Service Fee added to the room rate and taxes. I had a newly renovated room on the 7th floor which was excellent - a little small but more than adequate, great bed, super clean bathroom, and very quiet for only seven floors up.;5
Walking out of the Penn Station subway steps I was pretty pumped to find that my hotel was basically right there. The room was fine, the front desk was very helpful and the bed was comfortable. Basically all I need in accommodations;4
I was pleased with the service from hotel staff and the room was clean and well appointed. The bathroom was also clean and well kept. I would recommend this hotel.;4
What a find. ..slap bang in the middle of the action with eateries for breakfast, lunch and evening meal on site. Food delicious and reasonable and incredibly hard working, diligent staff, regardless of how busy they get. Free toiletries too, just the thing for a deep bath and hardcore shower that felt like an Indian Head massage. The rooms are ample in size as was the Queen size bed. Comfy pillows and crisp white sheets and towels, just the thing after 4 days NYC sightseeing. My daughter met us with the shiny new son in law, they stayed for 2 nights and got 40% off so there are discounts to be had. I'd have given it 5 if we had been given bottles of water and the decor had been a little more upmarket but all in all a marvellous art deco building, complete with gym...thank you;4
Very clean warm room. Pleasant Brasserie restaurant and bar attached. Small room with small Kingsize bed, adequate bathroom and room facilities ie iron/board, hairdryer. No tea/coffee making facilities. Central location brilliant with helpful Concierge.;4
this hotel is well located but their rooms are ,really too small,,no view at all...we wait for the elevators quiet a few minutes,.lobby is always too crowded,i dont like it. as i said ,the location is excellent..;3
Booked for my wife's 50th birthday. I read all the reviews about disinterested staff and 'the rooms are small'. Well, the room we had wasn't huge but let me tell you, it was very well appointed (loved the nespresso coffee machine !) and was big enough for what was needed. The staff were EXCELLENT- we found them friendly, attentive and all of them seemed genuinely concerned that we had a pleasant stay. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel which is ideally located for all NYC city attractions (and close to Penn Station) and would certainly use it again myself. Would have given them 6 stars if I could.;5
A great quirky hotel, excellently located, we were in easy walking distance of Times Square, the Empire State and Broadway, the rooms were well appointed, if a little snug, we loved the Art-Deco original styling, which all looked original to our uneducated eyes! The bed was queen sized and comfortable, even though we didn't request clean towels every day we got them, I managed to break the safe in the closet, but staff were helpful and replaced it with out fuss or charge, the only downside to the hotel was the external noise, even on the 19th floor you constantly hear the traffic throughout the night, better double glazing would help, also we were woken twice by people using the showers in their rooms, but thats a minor gripe. Overall a good hotel with helpful friendly staff,;4
When an old friend was visiting from Florida my husband treated us to a room in NYC.  Taking the train in from Long Island  the hotel was in a good location. The staff was friendly,  knowledgeable and helpful. Our room was nice,  but small.  It was fine since we were just sleeping there. For out of towners they help you book  tours,  plays etc. I  would recommend this establishment.;5
Stayed here for 4 nights - Check in was fine, room on the 27th floor. Thought we would have a nice view. Opened the door - the room was the size of a shoe box - no view at all, we were facing a wall. Room was clean. We ate in the Tick Tock each morning and really enjoyed it. The location is perfect, right across the road from Penn Station and a few blocks from Port Authority, around the corner from Macys. Now I did have a few issues with the hotel - 1. The concierge was sooo rude - she spoke to me like I was a bold child when I enquired about an airport shuttle - our flight was not leaving till 8pm from Newark and she advised me that I would have to take a shuttle at 2.30 and when I explained to her that this was far too early for us she got up on her high horse and when my;3
This was the highest tech hotel in the 1930's - Tesla lived here...rooms were clean and so was the bathroom, they room was small compared to a suburban suite - but we were not here to stretch out our luggage...the location was excellent 1 block from Penn Station and central to everything we wanted to see / explore around Manhattan.;5
Hotel was okay needs a bit of a makeover bit dated rooms are quite small staff was friendly The hotel is very close to everything in good location of macys and train station         Staff and cleaners were very friendly so overall had a great time in new york;3
small and old room. Bed to small. Cleaning Personal very friendly at the Reception not so. And altimes Controll when you entering the Hotel for the elevator 36th was great nice fiew direction freedom Tower.;3
This hotel is in a prime location opposite Madison square garden, with views of the Empire State, but that's all it had going for it.  We booked a room for us and our adult son, but the only bathroom in the room was in our bedroom!  He didn't want to come into our room neither did we want him to.  The staff were very reasonable and moved us into a room with 2 bathrooms.  We were assured that the 2nd bed would be made up, as it was a sofa bed, but on 3 occasions we had to pull this out and make it ourselves.  One morning we woke up to a mess where a rodent of some kind had chewed through a carrier bag and packaging and eaten chocolate that we had bought as a gift.   The manager was supposed to call us up that day as we didn't want to wait in, but this never happened.  When we;2
The room was small but clean and relatively quiet, given the location. Two attached restaurants were convenient.  The service was not great. I checked in, and when I had problems with my keys, I was required to lug my bags back down to wait in line at the check-in station again. They re-ran the keys, which worked fine the first time I tried them. But when I returned from running an errand, the keys did not work again. I had to wait on security (at least 10 minutes) to let me in. He confirmed my keys didn't work, and suggested I get an escort to my room every time I left. I ordered room service and stayed put.;3
We had a large room with the most amazing view of the Empire State Building, which changed colour every night. Best to get a higher floor if you want views across the city. The staff were very helpful with directions, and ideas of what to do and the best way to get to places. Beautiful Art Deco style throughout.;5
Hotel was great!  Everything clean, but a real bonus was the two restaurants, an Italian one for dinner and the Tick-Tock for breakfast.  Just great. Location couldn't be topped.;5
Arrived at the hotel and got dealt with immediately.  The staff were helpful and informative.  This is a third visit to the hotel and we had a lovely surprise and were upgraded to a suite on the 39th floor.  The staff were friendly and would always give you a 'good morning' or 'hello' whenever they saw you.  The hotel was clean and tidy.  We had any issue with the iron and lack of bath pug in the room.  Within minutes housekeeping and maintenance were on the scene and rectified the problems.  Good work!!  I will DEFINITELY be returning.;4
"We arrived at the hotel one day late after a nightmare with the fog. The staff were wonderful and checked us in at a rapid rate, just as well as we had been ""on the road"" for 18 hours. Our room was beautiful with a view of the Empire State Building, the bed comfortable with a first class bathroom. The hotel is right in the middle of the action, but as we were on the 22nd floor, were unable to hear anything. We did a lot of walking, and visited some wonderful places. A remarkable place, and I will be going back.";5
The New Yorker has a lovely art deco design with comfortable rooms.  The staff were pleasant and helpful.  It has easy access to many parts of the city and a block from Penn Station.  The bed and linens gave a good nights sleep.;5
Was given a tiny room when we had paid for the upgrade to a larger room. Also, temporary fire escape ruined our view, which we paid extra for. But other than those things, our experience at the hotel was very good. Great customer service, everything worked, just very old bathrooms, etc. Location was great and we didn't stay in the rooms much anyways. I would stay again but only if I wasn't planning on staying in the rooms for an extended period.;4
New Yorker is my favorite hotel in the City. The staff,location, beds, are all wonderful.I just wish sometimes i the cost of a room is just a little lower.;5
Rooms are small as mentioned in other reviews, bathrooms are really small.  However, it's an older hotel and in the heart of the City.  Very close to Penn Station, the Empire State Building,Time Square, etc.  Both restaurants were good and reasonably priced. Nice gym. My husband asked for a better view and the front desk happily obliged.  For the price, not sure you can beat it!  Would stay there again.;4
Stayed 2-6.11.15. Great location, very simple to get from JFK to hotel with pen station opposite.  Hotel is classic. Yes rooms are very small, but simply adequate, no complaints. Only issue is there was only one plug that worked in the room which made charging phones difficult.  Bathroom old but useable. Staff very friendly, especially the lady who welcomed us down stairs every morning with info on the coming daily temps! And housekeeping ladies were friendly (floor 21) and one lady In particular (working 6.11.15) clearly loved her job and made time to tell us how happy she was that we had a great stay and safe journey etc, it's not often you get to see staff so Tick tick diner was fab, I get the hype about this place! (Will review) The trattoria bianca in the hotel was a;4
It is the New Yorker.  What's not to like? The check in was easy and the clerk friendly.  Staff was prompt in resolving one minor problem in the room.   The bed was probably the most comfortable I have ever slept on.  The suite was spacious and quiet.  One issue. Mothers is a mandatory daily facilities fee.  Why not just roll that into the basic price?;5
Wasnt sure what to expect - mixed reviews.  Pleasantly surprised.  Hotel is in a great location within walking distance of Empire State, Times Square.  We also walked to Central Park and is minutes from station and bus station.  Tick Tock Diner open 24/7.  Good Amercian food - although some of the staff could force a smile!  Trattoria and bar popular and busy with good atmosphere.  Not overly stacked with facilities but if you want a great location, comfortable hotel and stylish decor, this is a good choice.  We were in room 3631 on 36th Floor (Metro View Room) with a fab view on both sides of the Hudson River.  Further down, decor and rooms not so nice.  Bathroom ok - could be fitted out a bit better and no light in the dressing area.  Fridge extra.  No kettle or tea/coffee;4
First of all, this hotel or Wyndham just need to disappear.  Checked in on a Saturday.  Had reserved the room for 4 nights.  Lobby was big but nothing really going for it.  The front desk gave me a room on the 27th floor.  I thought to myself great I will have a decent view.  Not only did I not get a decfent view, I got a loset sized room with barely space for one of us leet alone two people in there.  There was peeling paint everywhere.  Old gross doors you were afraid to open because you were not sure what you will find behind the walls.  I always check the bathrooms before I make myself comfortable so you can guess what I found had me horrified.  Black spots all over the nasty old white time, peeling paint, and gualk from the tiles.  Oh god it was vile.  You think I stepped;1
I stayed at e Wyndham New Yorker Hotel for 4 days from end of October 2015 for four nights on a trip to New York City with my mum.  We chose the hotel for its location which was very convenient for seeing all the top Manhattan sites. Very easy to get to from JFK airport by taking the skytrain, change at Jamaica station then the Long Island Railroad to Penn station, the hotel is less than 5 mins walk from Penn station.  Its also virtually opposite Madison Square Gardens, 5 mins walk from Macys and about 10 mins from the Empire State Building.  Hotel has a lot of history and is decorated in the art deco style with nice details throughout. We had a very large room on the 28th floor overlooking the west side of New York and the Hudson river. Room had two queen size beds, 2 closets;4
This hotel was one of the best I have ever stayed in. The location is fantastic for sightseeing in New York. It is very easy to get about. There is a subway station nearby and lots of sights are within walking distance such as Empire State building which you can view from the hotel and Macy's is not far either. Lots of restaurants nearby. TickTock diner is attached. Had breakfast there every day. Lovely staff and food.  The rooms were clean and spacious. Had one double bed each.;5
Our friends from UK booked this hotel, drove down from Ontario to spend a couple of days with them so it made sense to stay at same hotel.  Hotel is nice and room had been renovated well.  Bed was very comfortable and bathroom was new and clean.  We didn't have a room with a view but there are rooms with a view available. We were impressed by security measures they take to ensure everyone going to elevators had id for staying at hotel.  Front desk staff were very efficient and friendly when we checked in and we had express check out.  Hotel has an all day breakfast restaurant, the staff were efficient and friendly and food was good.;4
Stayed for 3 nights (Should have been 4, thanks United)  Hotel was nice, clean and is in a great area with lots of shopping and things to do very close by. Had a great view from our room 32 floors up. Also used their service to get us to Newark for flight in a very nice Escalade.;5
"The bathroom looked like it hadn't been renovated since the 40s. The water pressure was nonexistent.  The ""queen sized bed"" was definitely more like a full sized bed. The rest of the furniture definitely looked dated and worn out.   The location was nice, however, and it was convenient to have a diner (albeit pricy even for New York) in the building.";3
I would rate this hotel as a 3.5  if that were available.   Wyndham New Yorker is an old hotel with charm. It is a 40 story hotel well situated near Madison Square Gardens, Macy's, Broadway and lots of action. The rooms are updated although there are some that are not quite as nice.   If you can get an upgrade to higher floors you will have some magnificent views. You may want the higher floor to limit noise from the busy city.  If you don not like old style places you may prefer smaller hotels on a few streets above that are newer and refurbished. That being said, this hotel really has character. You get a sense of Old New York. There are restaurants in the hotel and a Walgreens and CVS just across the street.;3
Myself and wife stayed at the New Yorker Wyndham from 17/10/15 to the 20/10/15 first impressions of the hotel was it was a classic Art Deco with all the trimmings of New York City grand reception with the big revolving doors. Reception were quick in getting you check in and served you with a smile great start to our stay. The hotel had a restaurant on the premises unfortunately we didn't eat there but looked rather inviting now I wish we had !!. Plenty of elevators for you to get to your rooms and they were quick in coming the rooms are very well decorated and are clean and a good size we had a problem with our keycard as we couldn't get into our room we went and spoke to a lovely lady I hope I have her name correct odeneil she kindly gave us a upgrade to a room that had a very;5
I visited with my now fiancé (after proposing on the Brooklyn Bridge during our stay) and we absolutely LOVED this hotel as it was clean, friendly and in an excellent location. We stayed on the 37th floor with a view of the Empire State and wider city which made the stay so much more enjoyable as we were greeted by sunrise through the city skyline in the morning and a lit up Empire state by night.   We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel as we were busy being tourists everyday but we did eat breakfast in the Tick Tock Diner and the food was lovely (strawberry pancakes in particular!). The hotel have staff by the elevator 24/7 to ensure strangers can't wander in which I thought was a good touch. The building it's self is a traditional 1930's design so don't expect ultra;4
I just stayed at this hotel for the 2015 NYC marathon weekend with my wife and teenage daughter for a total of five nights.  Everything is very clean and the staff attentive.  I especially liked one of the concierges, but I didn't get her name.  Great location just feet from Madison Square Garden and half a mile from the Empire State Building.  We had a room with a view on the 28th floor and it was incredible.  A short walk to Times Square and the Javits Center and Pier 78.  The Tick Tock Diner off the lobby as very good and reasonable.  We had a room with two full size beds.  It was small, but who wants to stay in the room anyway in NYC?  We would definitely stay here again.;4
We stayed there just for one short night but it was a pleasant stay. Large lobby, quick check-in. We had a suite made for up to 4 persons, two rooms and two bathrooms. The location is really nice, very central with good restaurants in the neighborhood.  The hotel is old and genuine, which you can notice on the bathroom which is small. Rooms could be more modern, or European perhaps. But that is what I like. Everything worked well even though it was a labyrint to find the room at 20'th floor. Elevators worked perfect and there were plenty of them.  I have no problem to recommend this hotel to any of my friends!;4
Great hotel...friendly, helpful staff, Tick -Tock dinner had good food reasonably priced and rooms were clean and well maintained, lobby great place to people watch...and would definitly use this hotel again;5
"Love this hotel...only issue is the size of the rooms...when checking in ""Jose"" said we had been upgraded.  When we arrived in our room, I swear it was by far the smallest room I had ever stayed in (even smaller than european rooms).  Did I originally book a closet and then was upgraded to this room?  Anyways, we just stayed in the room and made the most of it.  I will say that after the initial shock of the room size, it kinda grew on us and enjoyed the rest of the trip. With this said, I will say that I'll be returning to this location, now that I know what to expect.";4
6th Visit to the New Yorker.....not disappointed.  Lovely hotel, friendly efficient staff....the renovated Tick Tock diner was brilliant as ever ! Such a brilliant location. The rooms were spotless and the beds were so comfortable with crisp white sheets. Just the job ! Will be returning .........Thankyou New Yorker another wonderful trip to New York.;5
Suffice it to say that the Wyndham NewYorker Hotel is an iconic building in Manhattan for decades - however the Wyndham renovation project does NOT do the building justice at all.   Lipstick switch more so than real renovation, the Wyndham project is an absolutely bust in my opinion. From the paranoid and illogical customer service (day managers included), to the thick smokey smelling hallways, to the extra small quarters (old hotels typically offer much larger rooms), this hotel stay disappoints on many levels.  While I was attending the DMFS conference, the conference facilities are cramped, only partially renovated (lipstick on a pig) and inadequate for the needs of the paying sponsors.  Wyndham Hotels and Resorts should stick to secondary markets with their Walmart quality;2
This was the worst hotel room, in size and appearance, we have ever stayed in for the last 50 years. The hotel nickeled and dimed every movement, even charging $2.00 to store one small piece of luggage.  It ruined our 50th wedding anniversary travels to all the special places in our life from California to New York.;1
Room just average but view very nice. Very good training facilities included. Staff ok. Cleaning good. Three guys in a room with just two double beds... Not what we expected but we didn't search facts before trip so we blame ourselves... Read everything very thorough before booking room because of extra costs and hidden costs.  Dont forget the hotels own little $27/day charge...!!!  Perfectly situated at the 34th for the first time turist with a lot to see within walking distance. For example Madison Square Garden (100 mtr), Empire State Building and Times Square. Penn station, which is kind of a hub, is right outside the door with direct line up- and downtown and one station away is a big bus terminal.   Penn station is also perfect for JFK with several ways of coming from and;4
We had a fabulous 5 night stay here recently. We had a room with two double beds and a bathroom and a walk in cupboard/wardrobe which was great to put all the suitcases etc in. The room was not large and the bathroom was small but it is quite an old hotel and so brilliantly placed in New York that space was limited I guess, hence skyscrapers being built there. The wifi worked all the time, we didn't get a chance to use the gym that was included in our tariff and although international calls were also included in our tariff we never could get a line out - small details really. The beds and bathrooms were comfortable and clean. The safe in the room was brilliant. Our views over the Hudson river and beyond to New Jersey were gorgeous and the hotel is so well placed. Subway stations;4
Great room due to very helpful service from Mohammed at the front desk.  Humorous and pleasant. He spent extra time finding us a room with a view of the city including the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings. I'm not sure every room has views like this but ours is very nice. Good location with lots of places close by. Thanks, Mohammed.;5
The location of the hotel is very convenient.  We enjoy walking so this was a great location for all the places we went to see.    The initial room we were given was NY small - while it did have two double beds - it was extremely claustrophobic for two adults and two teenagers.  The hotel was fully booked but they were able to find another hotel room that had a bit more square footage which allowed us to move around and not be on top of each other.  The rooms are fine - it is an older hotel so take that into consideration if you are expecting contemporary.  The beds are comfortable and have nice linens.    Personally I prefer glass over plastic cups in the room.  If you call housekeeping you can get a Keurig coffee maker in your room but you have to call them.    The concierge;4
"My room was surprisingly spacious for a NY hotel; the bed was comfy and so were the pillows - a big plus.  Noise level was acceptable, and the staff were quite friendly.  The location can't be beat; I would stay here again.";4
Consistently excellent, clean, efficient and friendly. Love the sense of history in this large deco gem.  Only complaint is the coffee in the Tick Tock Cafe that tastes like bitter, burnt beans.  Stay here. Get your coffee across the street.;5
The hotel is in a convenient location for getting around the sights of New York and accessing public transport, even if the neighbourhood itself isn't the most appealing.  The hotel is rather run down and the rooms fairly small, albeit that is reflected in the price (generally cheaper than other central NY hotels).  All this would probably have given a 3 star rating. However about a week after I returned I checked my credit card statement to find they had taken a $60 charge from my account (which I had not authorised). Bizarrely the charge was dated a couple of days after we had checked out and was for valet parking (we didn't take a car). There was no mention of the charge at check out.  The money was refunded (or 'adjusted' to use their words) after some email correspondence,;1
We booked 6 days through Agoda.com. The payment was meant to be made at the Hotel. When we reached the hotel, there was a booking but was told that no room rates were contained in the booking and that we will have to pay a much higher rate. (There were room discounts on the hotel websites however.) We later produced a copy of booking information and an email from Agoda.com mentioning the correct rate. However, the hotel manager on duty refused to accept it. My credit card was charged arbitrary rates for the six days.  When I went to return the keys before leaving, I saw another customer arguing with the counter staff on a similar issue.  The hotel is in a good location hence use it by all means. But be aware of the trick and use a good website and take up the option of advance;3
This hotel hosted a business conference that I attended. Rooms are small and not well appointed -- no coffee maker, small desk, no notepad or pen in room. No room service menu, had to have one sent up. Room service provided by Tick Tock Restaurant and was dreadful, everything arrived in paper bags with take-out plates and plastic cutlery -- including soup in a paper coffee cup! For that money, one expects at least a tray and real plates/cutlery. I love the history of the New Yorker Hotel but would not stay here by choice.;3
Very nice hotel for the price we paid and being in New York.  I don't really understand the complaints about the room size so much, it is New York, I leave the room....But it was small, we were in the Metro Queen Room. (Which I think is the smallest). In New York there are a lot of hotels with shared bathrooms, this is not the case here.  They seemed to being work on this hotel, the outside part, so you could hear noises and such at times. Sometimes you could hear people in the hallways, so maybe some noise cancellation would help. However none of these things are an issue for me and some they cannot control anyways.  If you ride the Amtrak train to the city I highly recommend this hotel as it is like a block from Penn Station and where most buses drop off.  I don't think you;5
Just coming to the end of our stay and go home tomorrow. So sad to leave. Excellent check in by helpful staff. Nice clean room overlooking the Hudson. Special mention to Catherine on security. Very interesting to talk to and gave us helpful hints for eating out etc. Loved the atmosphere in this traditional and historical hotel. Fantastic location and not one rude person in sight. We will hopefully be back as we have caught the NYC bug and the Wyndham exceeded our expectations!;5
The hotel's architecture and profile are iconic.  The rooms are small, but if you're out on the town all day, who cares?  If you ask for a high floor you can get great views.  The lobby bar/restaurant is fun and offers good service.  There's also a large 24-hour gym in the basement. Very convenient to the subway, restaurants, Javits Center, and shopping.   I like this place.;4
We are a family of three & have just returned from staying at this hotel for 6 nights, my travel agent booked us a Metro room with two double beds, we booked back in April & yes it cost us a small fortune but I expected it would with flights etc & it is NYC.  We took a taxi from JFK, which you can get from outside the airport, the fare is a fixed rate & you can pay the driver either in cash or by card.  The journey took an hour & the traffic was heavy but was a good way to see the Manhattan skyline appear.  We were dropped right outside the front of the hotel & yes it is covered in scaffolding.  The lobby is pretty & very clean & there are sofas & plugs to charge your phones, laptops etc & was pretty busy with people.  There was not a queue for check in.  We were dealt with in a;4
"I booked this last minute, and expected to pay a premium because of the time  of year (NYC Marathon, sold out MSG 2 nights) and location. What I didn't expect was a 1980's room. It was not an updated retro look which I have seen in some hotels. The entire room need to be updated, the sleeping area seemed as if there were certain updates, although the bathroom was an embarrassment. Paint was literally pealing off the wall, mold in the grout lines, a shower head that had the pressure of a fire hose, the valves squeaked as you turned them on and off (I could clearly hear the other ones in the adjoining rooms) the toilet seemed to be one you would find in a locker room  and the water ""never got hot"".  I stood at the front desk for 5 minutes until a receptionist showed up, and when I";3
Would definitely recommend staying here, it's a great location, very nice hotel w/ old school charm and friendly staff;5
We stayed here last month, for just under a week.  The location is great, right next to Penn Station, so easy to get around from there. The hotel is adequate, comfy beds, clean linen every day and realitively quiet for a New York hotel. We had great views of the city from our room.  The hotel is a little tired but we loved the Art Deco ness of it.;3
Been to other Wyndham but this New York Wyndham is far below their standards As to room cleanliness, service, courtesy, helpfulness to clients. I thought it's probably an old hotel newly acquired by Wyndham and the reason for not being at par.;3
"After searching long and hard for a conveniently located and value for money hotel for our 4 night stop in New York we finally decided on this hotel. Truly it is ideally located so as all the famous places are within easy walking distance  we arrived by train from Newark airport and got to Penn Station which was opposite the hotel  Checking in was not too difficult despite the fact rlthat the reception person initially could not locate our booking drspute being given a number  The hotel reception area is very good but the rest givrs you the feeling of an old building in need of internal modernisation ; the roomd though adequate felt cramped for space and we had to ask for tea making facilities in the room they were not automatically provided.  At nearly 240 pounds plus per night";3
Stayed here for 2 nights while in the city. The room and hotel looked nothing like these pictures! The place was old and run down. The room was the size of a shoebox too! Terrible! I wish I had taken a pic. The bathroom was old too. It looked like the tile had paint over it to cover up grime. The beds were old and hard as rocks.   The reason they didn't get 2 stars was because the staff was very friendly.;3
Very central, especially if you arrive at Penn Station. Rooms ok but ours was not too roomy. It was on the 24 th floor and higher would be better. The Diner was good. The bathroom was ok but it had to compromise too much to retain original features so it was not very convenient.;4
We enjoyed a 3 day stay at this perfectly situated Hotel for all New York Attractions, The room was clean and adequate, spacious enough. The staff were extremely courteous and helpful.  There is a Bar, Restaurant and Tick Tocks for all Breakfast's, snacks etc. Plus conference facilities.  Highly Recommend this Hotel.;5
"I have been to new York many times , but I had never stayed at the New Yorker. The staff were friendly and helpful, especially the Concierge staff, Only downside there was no ""fridge"" Would certainly go again";4
Ok so maybe I was unlucky but the hotel was just not very nice It was clean enough, and had most facilities, but no coffee machine... in USA! Come on quite ridiculous to be charged for one. Hotel fills itself with kids who board there The diner is nice enough, but staff are rude, but not sure if that is just New York;3
Ok so I think everyone has covered location which is why I like this hotel and returned twice. The issues with the rooms is why reviews vary. If you book the cheapest room 'metro' it WILL be small. If you book one of the suites from my experience it will be big. Yes corridors are dated and decoration in suites but it's clean. The downside to this hotel is its admin/management. Twice now they have not been able to provide the suite I have booked i.e 2 bed New Yorker suite on check in. I think they overbook on the assumption that people may cancel but they don't. Then like me you end up in a metro room anyway. Ok they did move us on the 2nd night to in fact a lovely suite that Muhammad Ali once stayed in and gave us $80 to spend in restaurant but it's just hassle. I had to;4
We had 4 nights, 4 people, 2 rooms.  I paid for both rooms.  One receipt had a $25 per day fee, the other did not.  I left a voice mail to have someone return my call, and no return call.  This was not explained to me upon arrival.;3
Ok, so it's New York. Everything is expensive, as is this hotel.  But firstly, the check in desk, should people really have to wait 30 mins plus just to get to the reception desk. And then be told it was too early to check in, so 75 bucks or else. Not prepared to wait another 30 mins later in the day, I stump up, looking forward to the room with the view of the Hudson River, or the Empire State Building that I paid for.  I get scaffold and the building next door. So, later on I go down an complain, apparently it has been the bain of their life this year, people being promised such rooms.  Don't advertise them on you websit then .... So no room available that night, but pack up everything in the morning, and the cases will be in the room when you get back at 6.00. We get back at;2
Room was a little small for a family of 4 the picture above was a lot bigger room, the bath shower was a bit grotty.  Air conditioning was good, the location was really good very near to Macy's round the corner from time square. There was scaffolding outside when we were there so our view was impacted which was a shame as the Empire state was right in front.;3
The New Yorker is located directly at PennStation, near Madison Square Garden. Small, but clean room. Great view from the 30th floor. Nice 24 breakfast at the Tic-Toc-Restaurant in the lobby. Good Wifi. Friendly staff.;4
We really enjoyed this hotel.  Built in 1929, it has many modern improvements while keeping the retro look.  Staff was very friendly,  place was very clean, no bedbugs,;5
Very pretty. Room is small but cozy. Restaurant excellent. Gym onsite but haven't tried it yet. Close to Empire State Building. Lots of business folks as well as tourists. Hot water is very slow making its way up 7 floors but water pressure is excellent.;4
This is my first visit to the big apple (New York). We selected this hotel because of its closeness to most attractions in Manhatan. The rooms rate is reasonable for downtown New York. The only concern is the parking. There is no free parking or special price for the hotel. Parking is a concern in downtown New York. The rooms are not spacious and the service is below my expectations. I would not stay there again.;3
Our room and bathroom were tiny, but comfortable and clean. Perfect location for all we wanted to do. Very good value. The Tick Tock Diner in the lobby is a real plus! Friendly and helpful staff. Would not hesitate to stay at the New Yorker Hotel again.;5
I decided to celebrate my girlfriend birthday in the city and i was very pleased with the services offer by the new yorker hotel staff. as we arrived to our suite, there was a birthday surprise on the bed for my partner, which made us really happy. the new yorker hotel staff was very friendly and were able to answer any questions we had. the room was beautifully decorated, like a home feeling, the view were breath taking and we had everything we needed and more in our suite! i will definitely come back to the new yorker hotel. we very much enjoyed our stay, i recommend this hotel to friends and family or to someone who is trying to find a home away from home feel. I would like to thank Sasha D for her time answering all my questions and i definitely picked the right hotel.;5
You can walk the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Times Square, Central Park, and take a train to the 9.11 Memorial. Perfect and would most definitely stay here again. Room was a bit tight and the bed was small granted I am only 6 feet even.;3
I love staying at this hotel in New York City. It is right in the heart of Midtown Manhattan and very accessible to a variety of attractions including Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, 42nd Street, and many more that are all within blocks of the hotel. It makes for a lovely weekend stay or any day of the week, whether your trip is business or pleasure related you will not be disappointed. I have stayed at this location at least ten times within the past months and always look forward to my next visit. The New Yorker A Wyndham Hotel is an excellent pick all around.;5
My Hotel stay was OK, The size of the room was small, and the bathroom was outdated. There was a lot of doors slamming at night from the other rooms adjacent.;3
The location was perfect. I had a room on the 17th floor, view of scaffolding and paid the same price as someone with a view of the city. Rooms are very small. Overpriced but this is New York.  Exercise patience;3
Even with a overbooked hotel, they managed to give a great service. Will definitely go back. Best located hotel in NY. In the middle of downtown. Just park your car and walk everywhere. We stayed on the 21st floor, kids wanted to stay in the hotel and look out the window.;4
We loved our stay at the New Yorker! The staff were friendly and the hotel is very centrally located. It was aprox 10min walk to Time Square and 3 min walk to main subway lines. The rooms were small but clean. We didn't really need a big room anyway since we spent most of our time out on the town. I highly recommend a stay here and would stay here again.;4
proximity to Penn Station, above major metro lines makes this hotel an ideal base for exploring New York. The rooms are clean, simply furnished and, because of its solid construction, extremely quiet for its mid-town location. The Trottoria and Tick Tock Diner have quality food for reasonable prices. Be sure to visit the hotel museum to learn about its history and famous guests.;5
"The hotel is a great home base for exploring Manhattan especially if you are coming into the city via Penn Station.  The room was actually larger than expected (based on reading other reviews).  Check in was quick and there were always elevators available.  I have 2 main negatives for the hotel.  First, the ""queen"" bed is ridiculously small.  Both my wife and I felt like we were sleeping on the edge of the bed to not disturb the other.  If you are used to sleeping in a queen or king at home, you seriously may want to opt for a room with 2 beds.  Second, on our first night at the hotel I called for an extra blanket at 9:40 PM.  I was told it would be right up.  At 10:20 when I hadn't received a blanket I called again and was told it would be right there.  At 10:40 when I called";3
This was more of a 3.5.  The location was fantastic, and I felt safe even staying so close to Penn Station.  The lobby was well staffed and large and welcoming.  The rooms, however, were pretty small and bathroom was tiny.  I understand this is average for New York, but for the cost, I would have expected more.  The doors also did little to block out noise.  Between rooms it was okay, but anyone in the hallway felt like they were inside the room with us.;4
I was there from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25. They charged $500.00 Cad a night, which is almost $400.00 a night. The location is perfect, but the hotel is not worth it. The hall way and entrance is old and does not show clean. The room was small and the air was not fresh. The bath room was moldy, dirty and very small. There was not any coffee, tea or anything else in the room. They charge 27.00 a night for resort fee which I could not understand, what that was for? Overall this hotel is not worth it for the money they are charging. The only thing was fine is the location.;3
"Usually we stay more north (last 2 trips have been 42nd The Grand Hyatt & 59th The Marriott)  We thought we would stay a little closer to the main attraction ""Times Square"" And also the added bonus of Macy's being 2 short blocks away!! :)  Ok so the good points, upon entrance the lobby is beautiful, very clean & fresh looking, we arrived from the UK on an 8hr flight so really just wanted to get to our room, freshen up & head out, check in was smooth, not the quickest but the lady on reception was polite!  We made our way into the lift heading for our room on the 19th floor, I'll be polite in saying that you can clearly see the hotel are making changes however the appearance of the hallways doesn't leave a lot to be desired! Now I know I said we'd stayed further up at (The";3
My partner and I stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel for 14 nights in October this year (2015). We had a great stay overall finding the staff attentive and courteous. On check in I advised the Guest Service Agent that I was in NYC to celebrate my 50th birthday and just after arriving at our room a lovely bottle of champagne was delivered to our room on the house.  Whilst not top end it, it was good quality and a lovely touch. These touches make such a difference!!! Thank you Wyndham!  The New Yorker is an older property with loads of art deco character. If you are looking for a totally pristine brand new room don't look here but really that would be the only reason not to choose this hotel. In saying it's not pristine the room was in very good order, very comfortable and as;4
"Before booking this room, I read other reviews and was prepared for a tiny, old, dingy room.  What a pleasant surprise.  The room was great.  The bed was comfortable and incredibly quiet given the location of the hotel.  Our family of four was very happy; we had a two-twin bed room.      The other reviews were correct, there was old paint on the doors- especially the bathroom, BECAUSE THEY TOOK THE TIME TO KEEP THE OLD SOLID WOOD DOORS when they renovated, brass door handles and all.  The Art deco style architecture (especially the great old elevator lights), was a step back in time and the location was well worth the price.  There are a lot of charges and fees, so be sure to double check your bill BEFORE you book.  There are plenty of warnings on the reviews about the added";4
"NYC hotels are hit but mostly miss. .new yorker is a miss..the renovation did little to make me like this place. Standard rooms are small. I was ""upgraded"" to a dark room that had no counter space in the bathroom. Walls are thin. Location is okay. Great for javitz center but so so to see the sights. Staff unengaged. Doorman reluctant to help..pass unless the price is right.";3
I stayed at Wyndham New Yorker Hotel for a long weekend in NYC. Very positive is the location of the hotel, close to Penn Station with good access to the Metro and LIRR to JFK airport as well as to Uptown and Downtown.  The hotel itself is a very busy place with queues at the checkin and at the luggage storage. The Wyndham Rewards desk was always closed when I was in the lobby. Anyway, the staff is friendly and trying to keep waiting time short.  The rooms are clean and the sleeping comfort is good. Unfortunately the standard rooms are very very very very small, so that there is even no space for your luggage. Traveling with two adults, this could be a little challenge.  The bathroom is clean an functional, although its time for renovation to get back from the 1990s. As;3
The New Yorker Hotel in Mid-Town New York is great in terms of location, but suffers in terms of room comfort and amenities.  Our bathroom only had room for one person at a time, the sink didn't drain, and there was barely enough room to store our suitcases out of sight.  I had to request more hangers for the closet. The shower temperature was difficult to control.;3
Really enjoy our stay.  Great location.  The staffs are very helpful.  Special thanks to Krystle at the front desk!;4
"The one thing that the New Yorker Hotel has going for it is location. A subway stop right around the corner was ideal for us. Within walking distance of Times Square.  The issues: - Room size - which I believe is typical for most downtown NY City hotels - it is small. My spouse commented that we could fit the entire room, including closet and bathroom - into our master bedroom at home. Neutral rating.  - Expensive! With a 20% AAA discount - the room still ended up costing @ $400 a night after associated taxes and fees.  - Something that I complained about via the hotel's survey was the Wi-Fi capability. You will have a mandatory ""Facilities"" fee, which I believe covers the fitness center (we did not use), Wi-Fi coverage and possibly something else. I work in an IT shop at a";3
We had a very nice staying at this wonderful hotel.  We went to watch a fight at the Madison and The New Yorker was the perfect location.;5
Loved the hotel, room clean, comfortable, bathroom a bit dated. Seemed very busy. Great location near Macy's and Madison Square Gardens.  The staff were very helpful, pleasant and polite.  We only had a room only, used Tick Tock a diner which seemed part of the hotel. A busy American diner, amazing atmosphere. We breakfasted American style, large portions, a bit costly, lovely food.;4
I was very disappointed in the conditions of my room. Upon arrival, I waited 15 minutes in the check in line and there was only one person at the counter. I arrived at my room and the door had been propped open and the room was dark. Needless to say, that was a bit concerning. I had my husband stay on the phone with me while I checked the room. Once I assured him that no one was in the room, I closed the door and took off my shoes, only to find that the floor was damp. I requested a new room, which was better but still underwhelming. The tv didn't work, one of my towels had hair on it (gross) and so on. I would not recommend this hotel and would not stay there again.;2
Location very central and easy access to subway and Pen station. Couldn't check in early despite having requested it in advance. Check in desk appeared to be busy most of the time but staff were helpful as possible. Very busy foyer. Lovely Art Deco features remain in the hotel.  We had booked exec suite with breakfast and although room had separate sitting area, the bathroom was quite tiny and not very practical. I think the room had recently been refurbished but, maybe because it is an old building, I don't think it made best use of the space. Had to ask for coffee makings as they were not in the room and this was brought up right away. Breakfast was on floor 39 with great views over the roof tops and of the Empire State Building and the river. Only cereal, sweet pastries,;4
Loved this place,booked it purely because it was close to Penn station after arriving from Philladelphia with luggage,we usually like Hiltons as you know exactly what you are going to get but this hotel was a nice surprise,art deco features abound,door frames the lift,staircases ,lighting,coving etc,very stylish very clean and oozing character.;4
Got a renovated room, however, room was small and had no desk and chair which was important since I was travelling for business.  They failed to clean my room after my first night however they cleaned up after I mentioned it.  They cleaned every day after that for the remainder of my stay.  Friendly and helpful staff.;3
Room was nice size, clean and comfortable...however the bathroom could use a bit more shelf space for toiletries;4
I paid in advance for 2 rooms on their website.  Most hotels give you extra incentives to reserve online (priority rooms, shoe shines, etc).  However, we were given two rooms literally the size of closets facing another building.  I realize it's a very old building and 'that's NYC'.  But I learned my lesson here - I could have saved lots of $$$ on a discount website but paid hundreds more for no reason at all.  Hair in bath tub and no room service was a surprise too.;3
After many trips to NYC this is our go to place to stay... Great location , friendly staff, clean, clean, clean..... What more could you want when staying in NYC? Close to the subway and trains station, and close to all the things to see and do.;5
Great Hotel in a great location. Close to all transport. Walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, The Rockefeller Centre and of course the Empire State Building. Also walking distance to the High Line and Chelsea Markets and Shake Shack in Madison Square Park...not to mention Madison Square Garden and the Flatiron Building, basically the perfect location for a first time NY visitor. We haven't even left yet and I'm writing this review, that speaks volumes...from the front desk to the doorman to the concierge, we received the warmest of welcomes and politeness. We stayed in a Queen View Suite, on the 39th floor. Just, WOW! The view is amazing. Do yourself a favour and book this Hotel, you wont regret it.;5
We had a suite on the 82nd floor overlooking the Hudson.  The room was clean and well appointed, though a bit dated.  Had a good sized fridge and a comfortable, though somewhat small bed (think it was a Full size--we're used to a King).  My biggest complaint was the slow front desk service.  We arrived at 1 PM, waited in line for 10 minutes, only to be told our room wasn't ready.  We stored our bags and hit the city for a couple hours.  We came back at 3 PM and waited in line again to get a key.    On checkout, we again found ourselves in a long line waiting to checkout.  We also found that we could store our bags, but this time it wasn't free.  It was $2 per bag.  The New Yorker is a big hotel.  Possibly up to 1,000 rooms.  There are only 5 stations for front-desk staff, so the;4
I stay here quite regularly for business. Being so close to Penn Station is extremely convenient. While the rooms are small, they are clean and the staff is friendly as can be, especially Onelia at the front desk (not sure if that is the correct spelling). They are very accommodating for early check-in needs and show genuine concern for comfort of the guests.;4
Only one caveat - small rooms & bathrooms compared to newer hotels.  If that doesn't bother you, everything else was absolutely fine.  Newly refurbished rooms (our floor at least), excellent new gym (& near enough to High Line and path along Hudson for early a.m. runners), OK wifi, subway just around the corner, friendly & knowledgeable staff, reasonable restaurants (& room service) in the hotel, plenty of classic NYC diners in the neighborhood (if not upper end restaurants of note), near Macys, Empire State, Penn Station.  And a better price than newer, fancier NY hotels I've visited in recent months.  If you stay, make a visit to the lower level to look at pictures and memorabilia from the hotel's early days - very cool.;4
"I have such a mixed feelings on this property so here is my disclaimer I am fighting one bad incident s all the great things. So let me start with the bad:  Check in took me over an hour. the process was this......I arrived at the hotel to two huge lines. So we waited in one line for around 35 min to finally check in the lady at the front counter could not be rudder complaining to her colleagues about how she hated this job and her bad day. She then got aggravated with any questions I asked her. I was even told ""sir thats not my problem you should know better than to show up at a hotel before check in time"" My question was do I now need to wait in the other long line to check my bag as the rooms are not ready or do you have a bellhop who takes bags of new incoming guests. Which";4
It was a nice place. Can't get any closer to the subway. The showers go hot and cold and the free internet is only in the lobby. The information that I saw made us believe it was free hotel wide internet. The wifi in the lobby was ok to slow, speed wise.;4
No complaints about the hotel as it was clean,the double room was not massive but enough space to move around in.The location was excellent for moving around the city and near rail and coach stations.Not far from Time Square and any type of shop you want to visit.The Tick Tock café within the hotel serves good food and there is an excellent café one avenue down on 7th avenue called Andrews café/diner which is superb.They rate there food establishments A B C D etc so watch out for an A in the window as by law they have to show the rating in the window.;3
Overall this hotel is pretty good. The location is great if wanting to see the sights or other cities due to its close location to Penn station. Times Square is only about 15 mins walk away. The rooms are all clean and have an Art Deco charm. British traveller be warned. The hotel will add an extra $25 a day for facility charges which may not be used. This was not explained clearly on checking in. I think the management should review this policy.;4
This was the first time to the NYC.  We had arrived by cruise ship to Port Liberty, NJ and the ship had a bus taking passengers to Penn Station among other places.  This hotel is right beside the station so we could walk to it.  Luckily we checked in before the mass horde showed up.  Our room was nice with a large bed, large TV and clean bathroom.  We were on a corner on the 32nd floor and had two windows, one in each wall which was nice.  One window gave us a good view of Manhattan.  We had free high speed WiFi and had no problems using it.  The ice machine was down the hall making it convenient.  The blue line subway had an entrance right besides the hotel and other lines were within one or two blocks making it very convenient.  The hotel had a diner called Tick Tock which was;4
"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in September 2015 and we had a perfect stay! The hotel is lovely- from the very friendly and helpful staff, to the clean facilities, to the comfortable and clean rooms and the overall friendly and welcoming atmosphere to the hotel. Our room (on the 19th floor) had amazing views out over the Hudson River, and our bed was super comfortable too- which is what you need after long busy days out exploring the city!   One of the best things about the hotel is its location. It is pretty dead centre to everything in New York, especially Times Square and the Theatre District, which you can easily get to on foot. Also, when coming from Newark Airport, if you catch the train into Penn Station; when you exit the station, you are literally right opposite";5
"Hotel looks grand, rooms are clean but generally run down. The rooms were very cramp to the extent that my luggage had to be carried in. No bedroom slippers provided. No drinking water too. Beds were small and not very comfortable. Location is not ideal as it is around 15 streets from bus terminal and times sq.   All these I could tolerate. However the hotel staff were not very polite. There was a day where I slept in till 9am. The housekeeping came, opened the door, and shouted at me saying ""for goodness sake, hang the do not disturb sign outside!"" Continued making a lot of noise to show her unhappiness. That same day, I checked out and paid for $2 per piece of luggage to be kept in the luggage room. I returned to the hotel to freshen up before my flight and requested to know";1
every one was helpful, smiling, and friendly.  The only drawback was the size of the rooms which are small and the bed was small.;4
We arrived on the 24th August to an amazing welcome from Tony at reception. I had previously got in touch with the hotel as this was our first time visiting New York and myself and fiancée were getting married. We were expecting a double room however the hotel had upgraded us to a suite to our amazement which we were very overwhelmed with. The room was a great size and with views of Madison Square Garden and of the Hudson. The room was immaculately clean and house keeping colleagues did a great job and replaced towels and linen when needed. All the colleagues were exceptionally friendly and happy to help the concierge was very helpful for any advice and the door man is happy to get you a cab or car for a small tip.   The Tic Tock diner is handy however it is costly and the;5
Only had 2 nights for a business trip, however I wouldn't stay here again. Very dated building and scruffy interior and rooms. Great location but just not comfortable at all, tiny tiny rooms (and I travel alot) overall very disappointing.;2
"For a last-minute business trip, the Wyndham New Yorker was fine for my needs. It's centrally located, the bed was comfortable, and it's pretty easy to get uptown, downtown and to Brooklyn from this spot. But other then these things, I wouldn't stay here again unless I had no other options.  The rooms are small -- even by New York City standards -- and the entire place could use some sprucing up. Other small nitpicks:  -WiFi is spotty; works well sometimes, and slow-to-not working other times. -Temperature control did not work. -TV was bolted to the wall with no swivel (meaning, you couldn't watch TV directly from bed). -Shower turn-on handle was deep inside shower (meaning, you can't avoid getting blasted with water the second you turn the handle). -No views (at least, from my";3
"Tesla: talented scientist, lived at the New Yorker for the last 10 years of his life - there's a small museum downstairs.  For the hotel; interesting art deco decoration, definitely had charm although the flip side is that the rooms aren't particularly modern. OK though. Seemed odd that we had to pay an additional $20 /night service charge - maybe this is standard in NY?  Location is good for Times Sq, hop on/off buses, highline (recommended), empire state. Plenty of places to eat around plus the 24 hour diner in the hotel. General: not perfect, but we liked it";4
"I stayed one night on business - and the location was crazy convenient. The hotel is very near many transportation options. The staff was helpful. My room seemed like it had just been remodeled; snappy and clean. But wow...the room was tiny! I mean, really small. I was alone so that was ok, but it would have been unpleasant for two people. If you're traveling alone for a night, this is a good choice. But if you want a romantic weekend, don't get one of the hotel's mini-rooms.";4
The New Yorker was a very pleasant surprise.  Has a very nice lobby with 2 restaurants for a convenience.  We Tried the Italian - was very good.   Room was clean and well kept-only negative was the size of the bathroom. Overall very nice!;5
Clean with a friendly staff. The location across the street from Penn Station is excellent.  The room was small, and a long way from the ice machine not even one on our floor! Glad we were only there for one night.;3
Its a busy hotel with plenty of international travellers. We checked in and as I'd contacted them before we arrived to advise its for my wife's 30th, they generously upgraded to us to a suite on the 38th floor over looking the Empire State Building with a stunning view of Manhattan. The room and bed were big. The room had a lounge area with an extra TV, nice clean room and bathroom. The hotel is in a prime location within walking distance of Macy's, Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Madame Tussauds, Times Square and Penn Station (This was key for us as it was easy to get where we needed via subway) They staff was always friendly and helpful. There is a diner located at the bottom called Tick Tock which was alright. All in all a great stay with stunning views and we;5
If you want just a place to sleep near tourist locations, this is it. Very little to no wait for the elevators. Check in was quick. The public areas were clean and well maintained. The room, while clean, was run down. Scuff marks on the lower part of the walls and the carpeting was peeling up around the edges. Chipped and old paint through out. The bathroom was the worse. It was clean but need some up keep maintenance.  The bathtub had chips and grout is stained. The drains let off an awful smell, I had to keep the door closed  at all times.  The wifi was spotty in the room but tolerable. No outlets near bed.  Scaffolding outside of window, but expected (from reading other reviews) Overall, it was clean but needed an overhaul. Even with the issues, it was a tolerable stay and I;3
"We stayed at the Newyorker for 6 nights on the 22nd of September. The location is excellent. We received a warm welcome on arrival.  The facilities of the hotel are excellent, offers a free Gym, Concierge service and there own cocktail lounge. We felt very sage in the hotel as they had security 24 hours to make you feel exceptionally safe checking everyone had a room key before allowing them to enter the lifts.  The Lobby is huge with free Wifi (this is also included in your room)  Outside the front of the hotel is Madisson Square gardens, opposite is the Empire state building, just 5 mins walk away and your at Macys. 10 min walk and your in Times Square....just amazing!! 😀 The hotel met all our expectations.

If you need a hotel in the heart of Midtown this is it. Just off 8th ave and right oppersite Madison Sq Garden. Hotel is a gem if you love art deco as was built in 1929. Lobby is stunning. Landing was a little dark ad all the wood painted brown. Room was small but cosy and had everything you need. On site just off the lobby is a great dinner and on the otherside was a lovely restaurant so if u don't want to go out 9great if you have children with you ) ...what out for the cocktails they were strong !!. You really couldn't bet this hotel for location and facilities and a lesson in Art Deco ...just a note that reception will only change 100 dollars worth of travevellers cheques;5
First trip to New York, had heard most hotel rooms were small and the room we had did fall in to that category. Compact yes, but the comfiest bed and pillows, powerful shower, great view of the Hudson and perfectly located to either walk across to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden or walking distance to Empire State building and Maceys. Underground rail station right outside hotel to take you to alll the sights. Only used TickTock restaurant once for coffee and cheesecake so can't comment on food. Busy foyer 24/7. If your room doesn't have coffee machine just ask for one. Enjoy, we did.;4
Stayed 14 nights in New Yorker, in a 'NY Queen Suite' - that was upgraded to a 'NY Queen Suite View'. Overlooked the Hudson river and New Jersey. Suite are spacious, well maintained and heaps of storage space. Bed very comfortable and room quiet. Tick Tock diner very handy for late night snacks. Very good service. One night a party continued to 2am. Rang Concierge and he shut it down immediately. Also the Information Desk very friendly and helpful. Only downside was I considered the Bathroom small because of a shelf overhanging basin. Great location. All favourites within 15 mins walk, Madison Sq Grdn 3 mins walk and subway stations at the corners of hotel.;4
Great hotel, great location, visited this hotel 5 years ago. Standard rooms are small which is the norm in NYC. Top tip, if you fly into Newark get the train to Penn Station costs $12 dollars and you can walk 30 seconds out of the station to the hotel. If like us you like walking which is the best way to see NYC your in a great location to see Empire State Building, Macy's and 5th Avenue shops. Within walking distance to Madison Square Garden where we watched the Rangers in action, a must. If you are staying for 7 days get the Tube pass for $28 easy to get around rather than getting taxis.;5
Situated diagonal to Madison Square gardens! 15 minutes from the Empire State Building and 10 mins from the start of the High Line walk. Ask for a high floor due to traffic noise. Beds were very comfortable! The Tick Tock Diner inside the lobby was great and really made you feel you were getting the 'American Experience!'';4
"Here is my absolute disgust at the experience I had while staying at the Wyndham New Yorker in October 2015.  Prior to my arrival I was sent a text message with a link to an online check-in facility, where I followed the instructions, and yet, when I arrived, I still had to wait in line for 20 minutes to check in. What was the online process for ?  I had ordered a room with a ""Metro view"", and I paid extra for it. When I got into the room, I was shocked to see that it was a tiny, maybe 10'x10' room, staring into an alley. What happened to the Metro view ?  When I inquired downstairs with the manager, I was directed to another room, maybe 11'x11', and again, staring into some far-flung corner of Manhattan. I went back downstairs and complained that this was the same problem I";1
It was great staying in New York at Wyndham New Yorker Hotel,  with a beautiful view of the Empire State Building!!! Thanks 4 the gr8 service...;5
"My room was a Metro Room with a queen bed. I was a bit surprised that the room, itself, was so small, but it was reasonably priced for New York City, and I didn't plan to spend much time there but to sleep. The building is old, but very well maintained. My rating is four instead of five stars only because the TV reception and the wi-fi were a bit lacking, and the walls proved to be a bit thin when my ""neighbor"" chose to use the shower. That last, however, occurs even in the newest of buildings. In truth, 4 1/2 stars would be more fair.   The location cannot be beaten. It is basically kitty-corner from Madison Square Garden and just down the street from the Empire State Building and Macy's. I also ate a couple of meals at the Tick Tock diner in the lobby. The menu was extensive,";4
Unfortunately we only got to stay in this hotel for 3 nights. Such a lovely hotel. We got into the que to check in and staff went to open new desks immediately to prevent the que from building. The lovely woman who checked us in gave us a room on the 32nd floor. Said that those rooms had been recently renovated.   Lobby was grand and pleasant doormen. Easy to find room and the view was amazing. It may not seem to everyone but it was my first time in America and New York has always been a huge dream to being able to see all the buildings from our 3 windows was amazing. Bed was super comfy and bathroom was small but clean and tidy. Show head could have been stronger but that wouldn't have ever ruined our stay.  The hotel seemed in perfect location, we walked to times sq every;5
This was my first stay at the New Yorker and overall my party was pleased. We had 2 double rooms. The bedding area was spacious, the bathroom had only a shower with limited counter space. The sink drained a little slow but the shower had good pressure and was nice. Wifi was decent and about what you would expect at NYC hotels. This is an older building, probably built in the 30s, but our rooms were updated and larger than the newer hotels. I have stayed in newer places but felt I was in a large closet but not the case here. Would stay here again if the price is right.  Also, want to say that Mohammed was very helpful and did his best to meet our needs.;4
The rooms are above average but the service and location takes the cake. It is right opposite the penn station and also walgreens and numerous restaurants around the corner for a perfect place to stay for exploring New york.;4
Went purely on some reviews I had read and pictures... And all I can say is other than the location this is simply a roof for the night nothing special at all!! Hotel lobby is beautiful... The rest seems like a rundown motel! Bathroom looks like it's from the 30s and the room which was supposed to be a deluxe is like a box!! Would not stay again;2
Came here for the first time excellent location. Staff friendly and helpful room a bit in the small side apart fromthat  would definitely come back.Good restaurant in the hotel with good food. I would recommend to others great location to trains and subway.;4
This place is just terrible, terrible, terrible.  The bathroom was full of rust, mold, and some weird green gunk leaking out of the toilet handle.  The pics somehow make this place look decent, which is a stretch in and of itself.  The bathroom was seriously gross.   There is no refrigerator in the room and barely room to lay down your things.  The AC had a mind of its own, just decided to go on and off as it pleased.  The housekeeping would keep coming in the room even though I left the note on the door to not be disturbed.  I would not recommend my worst enemy stay at this dump.   Yes the location is in midtown which is convenient, but hey this is New York, almost everywhere is convenient.;2
We stayed in The New Yorker Hotel for 7 nights during our vacation in New York on October 2015. The hotel is fantastic for business and tourists vacations.  Hotel location is perfect- very close to Macy's, Times Square and the subway is next to the hotel. The rooms are renovated, very comfortable and very clean and the view is unforgettable.   The hotel stuff were friendly and helpful. Our favorite guest service representative who helped us with every request we had was Mr. Djiby Bah, Guest Relations Manager of the hotel. He is so kindness, professional knowledgeable and very helpful. From the moment we entered to The New Yorker Hotel to the moment we left it was a lovely and amazing experience and it was most of it because of Mr. Djiby Bah - Thank You!!!  We had a wonderful;5
1. Old and tired everywhere you looked. 2. Intake staff bored, minimally polite, long lines for no obvious reasons. 3. Long line to check bags into coat room. 4. For nearly $600 a night, the room fixtures seemed quite old and threadworn - and I had the 29th floor Suite!  5. The bathroom was clean, but again old, barely functional fixtures. Shampoos average and cheap, better ones in cheap motels. 6. The AC was just barely adequate - the thermostat claimed 60 degree. It must have been closer to 70, and could not be lowered. 7. No food or drink options as far as I could tell.  눇1. Location. Location. Location. 2. Tick-Tock diner next door for breakfast.;3
"One thing to mention here is location may be great, but the room was small and cramped. Service was okay - we only stayed one night but that was enough. For one of the more ""famous"" hotels in NYC, it failed to impress.";3
Tiny tiny older room. Very clean, comfortable bed, great wifi. No coffee service in the room. Good restaurant for breakfast right next door. Penn Station is across the street. Walking distance to Times Square.;3
My self and my daughter visited the New Yorker Hotel for 4 nights recently.  Our first point of contact was with Muhammad at check in and he laid the base for what was a fantastic visit.  Muhammad was so friendly and professional and he was able to answer all questions that we had.  All the staff in the hotel were so friendly and helpful and the room that we were in was very big for a NY hotel.  Will definitely be returning.;5
Beautiful Art Deco hotel, great location! Walk out onto the street and look up and you will see the Empire State building!   I stayed in 2 rooms, as another person joined our holiday a few days in so went from a double room to a small suite.   The first room was really small but very clean, beautiful decor and comfy double bed. One we moved to the suite it was a lot bigger. Lovely big double bed lots of space and off to the side through into a small living area (no door but a bit of privacy as it was separate) a nice comfy sofa bed. 1 bathroom and 2 TVs.   Maid was in everyday, towels changed every 2 or 3.   You are a short walk from Penn station and 10 min walk to Port Authority bus station.   Staff are friendly and helpful! The queues at reception can be quite long as it's so;5
"I can't imagine how anyone would give this hotel 5 stars, or even 4.  This would be near the bottom of all the places we've stayed in NYC.  Staff was extremely rude at check-in, basically yelling at us because the door to the room they initially put us in was broken (refusing to move us to another room, etc.).  They gave us some free vouchers for continental breakfast at the diner, but we regretted using those; sometimes free still isn't cheap enough, especially in a city like New York where there is so much good food to be had.
